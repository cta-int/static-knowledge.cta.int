They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

It explains the origin and functions of soil, describes the different soil types that can be found in Africa and their relevance to both local and global issues. The atlas also discusses the principal threats to soil and the steps being taken to protect soil resources. It is a key resource for scientists, practitioners and policy and decision-makers. Informed decision making is currently limited by the scarcity of up to date data on the soil resources of Africa. The JRC, in collaboration with the FAO and African soil scientists, will launch a pan-African assessment on the state of soil resources at the forthcoming conference of the African Soil Science Society in Kenya (October 2013).</p><p><a href="http://eusoils.jrc.ec.europa.eu/library/maps/africa_atlas/" target="_self">http://eusoils.jrc.ec.europa.eu/library/maps/africa_atlas/</a></p><p>(EC Joint Research Centre, 01/05/2013)</p><p>-</p><p><b>GIS helps reduce postharvest loss during transportation</b></p><p>A Ghanaian scientist designed a computer programme that combines satellite weather data and road conditions along different routes.

The aim is to better address complex global issues surrounding the need to feed nine billion people healthily by 2050. Its research focuses on how to improve nutrition outcomes through agricultural interventions, such as the introduction of nutritious crop varieties, educational programmes or government policies that make healthy foods more affordable. The June 2013 policy briefs reveal that: 1. Existing agricultural research methods fail to measure nutritional outcomes; 2. Agricultural interventions place different demands on women’s resources and time: how they can have a positive nutritional effect without additional burdens.</p><p><a href="http://www.lcirah.ac.uk/node/122" target="_self">http://www.lcirah.ac.uk/node/122</a></p><p>(LCIRAH, 06/2013)</p><p>-</p><p><b>Does rapid agricultural growth require a system of innovation? Evidence from Ghana and Burkina Faso </b></p><p>The ‘systems of innovation’ hypothesis is tested to determine if a dynamic and growth oriented agricultural sector is not possible without a functional system of innovation (SI). The researchers moved away from the national system of innovation to highlight the ways that the SI manifests itself using a selection of crops in Ghana and Burkina Faso (plantain, maize, millet, yam, sorghum) that have shown significant growth in production over the last two decades.</p><p>Using two indicators (a common understanding on objectives and priorities, and a high level of interactivity), the authors find (i) little evidence of common understanding of the objectives or priorities of the SI and (ii) low levels of interactivity. They noted that where there is interaction, it is mainly passive/informal. They concluded that there is weak evidence of the existence of anything that might be considered a high functioning SI. Increases in yield could have been attributed to increased acreage more than to increases in productivity and not to the SI. They are of the view that the most satisfactory explanation linking growth and a functioning SI may only become evident when farmers have exhausted the possibilities of easy wins. From a policy perspective, they suggest that it may be more opportunistic to target investment in agricultural research and other activities that support innovation.</p><p><a href="http://www.future-agricultures.org/research/science-technology-and-innovation/7847-working-paper-does-rapid-agricultural-growth-require-a-system-of-innovation-evidence-from-ghana-a-burkina-faso" target="_self">http://www.future-agricultures.org/research/science-technology-and-innovation/7847-working-paper-does-rapid-agricultural-growth-require-a-system-of-innovation-evidence-from-ghana-a-burkina-faso</a></p><p>(Future Agricultures Consortium, 01/05/2013)</p><p>-</p><p><b>Greening global value chains: Innovation and the international diffusion of technologies and knowledge </b></p><p>Using novel data on patents, trade of equipment goods, and foreign direct investments and insights from the economic literature, the paper seeks to lay out the state of knowledge on the role of innovation and the diffusion of technologies in the greening of global value chains as well as some of the main policy issues.

The authors focus on evidence that is underpinned by research as opposed to expert opinion or stakeholder views.</p><p>In debating the issue of evidence quality, they consider research as a ‘way of knowing’ while acknowledging that there are other ways: empirical, theoretical and experiential. Their overall argument is that the evidence quality depends on the ‘what’, ‘why’ and ‘for whom’ dimensions as they differentiate between the needs of policymakers and decision-makers. While consensus is possible among sub-groups of stakeholders on what is considered as good evidence, overall consensus is potentially an unreachable goal as power relations can also shape the outcomes. The&nbsp; issues addressed here, for example on the hierarchies of evidence and quality, standards and matrices&nbsp; of evidence, are interesting and relevant for all stakeholders involved in shaping complex and politicised decision-making.</p><p><a href="http://www.nesta.org.uk/library/documents/A4UEprovocationpaper2.pdf" target="_self">http://www.nesta.org.uk/library/documents/A4UEprovocationpaper2.pdf</a></p><p>(Research Unit for Research Utilisation (RURU), University of St Andrews, 11/2012)</p><p>-</p><p><b>How can universities influence development policy? </b></p><p>Members of the Evidence-Based Policy in Development Network (EBPDN) debated what universities could do to get their academic research ‘out there’. Some interesting suggestions included: ‘collective action as no single or isolated sector in society can accomplish the desired changes’, ‘updating the universities’ methods and contents so students grasp the fast-changing world of knowledge’, ‘creating&nbsp; policy research institutes to focus research on priority areas’ and ‘conducting&nbsp; research that respond to issues that are policy relevant’. Three specific strategies were suggested: (1) working with public officials to enhance and/or find ways to improve the implementation mechanism; (2) engaging in policy debates that address priority issues; and (3) having student conduct local needs assessment and share results with policymakers and local communities.</p><p><a href="http://www.drussa.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1931" target="_self">http://www.drussa.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1931</a></p><p>(Drussa, 28/05/2013)</p><p>-</p><p><b>The challenge of measuring performance of agricultural conservation and environmental programmes</b></p><p>This report commissioned by AGree summarises conceptual and methodological challenges of measuring the environmental performance of agriculture. The authors acknowledge that there is no comprehensive, widely accepted index or assessment tool which considers all the related factors concerning the impact of agricultural operations, practices and systems on defined environmental goals for water, wetlands restoration, and native species among others.</p><p>Different types of performance measures and approaches are reviewed to identify best practices and enhance understanding of the ways in which agricultural and environmental policy might be assessed and strengthened. One main recommendation is that it may be beneficial to engage farmers and ranchers early in the collection and interpretation of data. While it is emphasised that agricultural and environmental policies have distinct purposes, the authors conclude that neither should be pursued in isolation. They conclude that aligning agricultural production with improved environmental outcomes at the landscape scale is a long-term goal achieved through collaboration among various agencies and levels of government, producers, researchers, private companies and civil society.</p><p><a href="http://www.foodandagpolicy.org/sites/default/files/AGree%20Ag%20Conserv%20and%20Environ-Apr%202013.pdf" target="_self">http://www.foodandagpolicy.org/sites/default/files/AGree%20Ag%20Conserv%20and%20Environ-Apr%202013.pdf</a></p><p>(AGree, 01/04/2013)</p><p>-</p><p><b>Plant biotechnology: Tarnished promise </b></p><p>A <i>Nature</i> special issue on GM crops explores the evidence behind some of the most controversial claims about the technology, the impact of the negative attitudes towards this research field, recent advancements such as membrane transporters, and the engineering behind the second generation of GM crops. In this special issue, it is argued that GM research needs to happen outside of the industry (in the non-profit sector) so that developments are driven by objectives other than profit. Key messages point to the profit-driven GM crop development for industrial agriculture that may benefit only national revenues at the expense of smallholders and better livehoods for rural populations. GM crops for the poor, to help them combat malnutrition, secure higher yields and save on expensive input is one among several other viable options that can improve the agri-food systems in developing countries.</p><p><a href="http://www.nature.com/news/plant-biotechnology-tarnished-promise-1.12894" target="_self">http://www.nature.com/news/plant-biotechnology-tarnished-promise-1.12894</a> and <a href="http://clippings.ilri.org/2013/05/02/nature-takes-a-hard-look-at-the-messy-middle-ground-the-difficult-adolescence-of-gm-crops/" target="_self">http://clippings.ilri.org/2013/05/02/nature-takes-a-hard-look-at-the-messy-middle-ground-the-difficult-adolescence-of-gm-crops/</a></p><p>(<i>Nature </i>497, 02/05/2013)</p><p>-</p><p><b>Proteins called membrane transporters will be key to sustainable food production</b></p><p>Recent developments in understanding the biology of plant transporters are leading to improved varieties less susceptible to adverse environments and for improving human health. Membrane transporters are a class of specialised proteins that plants use to take up nutrients from the soil, resist toxic metals and pests, increase salt and drought tolerance, control water loss and store sugar. By improving current staple crops by modifying how transporters work in the plants, the biologists behind the discoveries believe crops could be made more efficient in using water, acquiring soil nutrients, etc., and taht growing them would directly reduce the environmental impacts of agriculture. By disseminating these findings widely, the researchers hope to educate policy makers and speed the eventual application of their discoveries to global agriculture. Challenges remain, but this is a promising research avenue. Are such improved food plants considered GMOs? Are they part of the next generation of transgenic crops that may well benefit food insecure regions of the world?</p><p><a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-05/uoc--npp042913.php" target="_self">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-05/uoc--npp042913.php</a> and <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-05/nbi-mfa042613.php" target="_self">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-05/nbi-mfa042613.php</a></p><p>(Eurekalert, 01/05/2013)</p><p>-</p><p><b>High-nutrition and disease-resistant purple and yellow-fleshed potato clones obtained</b></p><p>Four new potato clones which are characterised by their high antioxidant content, their good production both in size and number of tubers, as well as by their resistance to the usual diseases of this crop were obtained by natural methods through crossing varieties from South America with commercial varieties used in Europe. Researcher Raquel López highlights the importance of taking into account the clones achieved: ‘It is beneficial for European producers to have varieties of purple flesh potato that are adapted to the climatological conditions of this continent. Moreover, these varieties incorporate natural antioxidant compounds, which are nutritionally and visually attractive, both for restaurant professionals and for end consumers’.</p><p><a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-04/ef-had042413.php" target="_self">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-04/ef-had042413.php</a></p><p>(Eurekalert, 24/04/2013)</p><p><b>-</b></p><p><b>Screening the banana biodiversity for drought</b></p><p>There is a great need for research aimed at understanding drought tolerance. Screening for drought tolerant varieties and breeding crops with improved water use efficiency is a crucial step in the right direction. Bananas and plantains are a major staple food (especially in Africa and the Pacific) and export product (in the Caribbean) with a worldwide production of over 135 million tonnes per year. Water however is the most limiting abiotic factor in banana production. Five varieties representing different genomic constitutions in banana (AAAh, AAA, AAB, AABp, and ABB) were selected and subjected to a mild osmotic stress.
