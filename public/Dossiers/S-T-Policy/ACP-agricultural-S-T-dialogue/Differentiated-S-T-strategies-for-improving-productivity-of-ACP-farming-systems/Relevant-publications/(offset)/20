						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p> Understanding the key factors that contribute to adoption of technologies that improve farm productivity is paramount if sustainable farming production is to be achieved within the smallholder sector of South Africa. The key factors that have enabled a participative multidisciplinary research and development (R&amp;D) project to make significant impact in the adoption of fertilizer and legume technologies by a smallholder farming community in Mopani district of Limpopo province are reported. Information on the process of practice change resulting from interventions (farmer team and network development, training, on-farm experimentation, demonstrations) was collected through semi-structured and group interviews. Farmers have adopted improved farming practices, such as fertilizer use, row planting, intercropping of legumes, and pest and disease management. Capacity building of the farmers associated with the project has resulted in the development of significant leadership and organizational capacity to sustain improvement of farm performance. Changing the focus from subsistence to producing for profit has been a great achievement within this community. Despite the success of the R&amp;D project, the high age of the farmers (who are predominantly women older than 60 years) and frequent droughts are likely factors impeding continuity and sustenance of project achievements.

					<p> From 1993 to 1996, fieldwork was carried out in Chibuwe (Manicaland) and Fuve Panganai (Masvingo) irrigation schemes, Zimbabwe, to examine the farmers' view on the commercialization paradigm as propounded by Agritex, the principal government extension agency. By examining the way Agritex staff train Master Farmers, determine cropping programmes, and tackle risk management in the scheme, it is shown that the state's perception on commercialization differs from that of farmers. Agritex equates what is considered to be scientific farming with commercial farming, whereas farmers have no fixed philosophical position but look for practical solutions that can improve their livelihoods. Depending on circumstances, they can be commercial farmers but also turn to subsistence farming when needed. Risk management appeared to be an essential component of the enterprise. It is recommended to remove some of the entrenched biases towards scientific farming models and against farmers' livelihood strategies.</p>

					<p> The main causes of the decline of agricultural production in the oasis farming system in the region of Nefzaoua in southern Tunisia are identified and the constraints to increased production are indicated. Irrigated date farming is concentrated on the slopes around urban oasis centres. One of the main problems is that available water supplies are not always sufficient to meet down-slope cropland expansion needs. Abundant use of saline irrigation water has led to serious soil degradation in lower slope areas and lowlands as a result of the rising water-table. There is a risk that these areas will no longer be cultivable because of continued water logging and increased salinization. A modern interdisciplinary and ecological research strategy encompassing a broad range of system components, including socio-economic aspects of human involvement in these ecosystems, is required to enable an accurate assessment of water logging and salinity problems in these irrigated lands. Future sustainable development strategies should attempt to promote water conservation, economic diversification and control of illegal extensions of irrigated land.</p>

					<p> A case study was carried out among 103 farm family households in the southern Kordofan region of the Sudan, in 1993-1994. Mechanized farming systems and subsistence production systems were compared to: (1) question assumptions about the eviction of subsistence peasants, their proletarianization, and agrarian development that dominate the discussion on the country's peasant economy; and (2) develop an alternative for understanding the factors that govern the agricultural behaviours of Sudanese smallholders as well as the dynamics of change in the rural areas. It was found that the growing household's links to the local economy increasingly alter the basic conditions of peasant production, especially the patterns of labour time use. Off-farm work is increasingly becoming an important determinant of household farming strategies and of the process of rural differentiation. The preference for food production from own enterprise could be viewed as a farm-based insurance mechanism to cope with the high risks related to production, markets and employment.</p>

					<p> In the humid tropics of south-western Cameroon, 156 farmers in 11 villages were surveyed to quantify the factors determining farmers' adoption and use of alley farming variants, using an econometric model. Male farmers were more likely to adopt than women. Adoption was higher for farmers with contacts with extension agencies working on agroforestry technologies. Adoption was higher for farmers belonging to farmers' groups, and lower for farmers in areas with very high population pressure, as farmers in such areas may have greater labour productivity from use of less labour intensive technologies (e.g. chemical fertilizers). Adoption was higher for farmers in areas facing fuel wood scarcity. Farmers have made adaptations to the conventional alley-farming technology recommended by researchers, the most significant adaptation being the introduction of fallow periods into the system. Farmers use alley farming as a land use option, not as a replacement for the slash-and-burn system, since land supply is still relatively elastic. Achieving increased impact with alley farming variants requires effective targeting. Econometric modelling using farmer and village characteristics, socio-economic and institutional variables can lead to more effective targeting to farmers and locations where higher adoption rates may occur.

					<p> The logic of introducing fodder legumes into African farming systems is explored. The findings suggest that: fodder legume use in Africa was based on local experience and traditional practices; the development of fodder grasses has been a more important research theme in Africa in the past 100 years than the development of fodder legumes; there is no strong evidence that the agricultural revolution in Europe was a major contributing factor to attempts aimed at promoting fodder legumes in Africa; using appropriate methodology, national and international fodder researchers have developed some successful fodder grasses and legumes in Africa, especially for &quot;crop&quot; and &quot;niche&quot; roles; and, there are at least 3 well-documented examples of successful promotion of fodder legumes in African mixed (crop + livestock) farming systems. For the past 10 years, systems-based approaches to fodder legume research have had an increasing impact on productivity in and policy for African mixed farming systems.

					<p> Market-oriented production of gardening crops and cassava in the dry season is an increasingly frequent practice in Segou, Mali. Traditionally, these crops are protected from roaming livestock with the help of dead fences. In order to provide a sustainable alternative to dead fences, the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF) began promoting the use of live fences, i.e. living trees planted closely together around a field plot. This study was conducted with the first farmers to use these live fences. These farmers expressed satisfaction with the protection offered by the trees and their ability to provide a variety of medicinal, economic, and food products. The form of land tenure, the social status of farmers within their families, and the availability of labour seem to be important factors in the decision to test the live fence. This raises questions about the accessibility of this technique and its possible contribution to the social and economic differentiation of its users. From authors' summary.</p>

					<p> Low external-input (LEI) agricultural technologies are commonly developed for and promoted in poor rural areas of the developing world because they are presumably more appropriate for farmers who may not have the access or ability to adopt methods requiring significant purchased inputs. The System of Rice Intensification (SRI), a LEI technology, has received a fair amount of attention in recent years both in and outside of Madagascar, where remarkable yield increases have been achieved in a country where most farmers are unable to grow enough rice to feed their families. Despite its promise, SRI is difficult for most farmers to practise because the method requires significant additional labour input at a time of the year when liquidity is low and labour effort is already high. While SRI may be unique for its dramatic yield increases and relative complexity, the highly seasonal, labour-intensive nature of SRI is common to many LEI technologies, calling into question the common assumption of the appropriateness of such technologies for smallholders.

					<p> The potential of using Participatory Farm Management methods to examine the suitability of a technology with farmers prior to on-farm trials is explored. A study examining the suitability of green manuring as a technology for use with wet season tomato producers in Ghana is described. Findings from this case study demonstrate that Participatory Budgeting can be used by farmers and researchers to analyse current cultivation practices, identify the options for including green manures into the system and explore the direct and wider resource implications of the technology. Scored Causal Diagrams can be used to identify farmers' perceptions of the relative importance of the problem that the technology seeks to address. The use of the methods in this ex-ante evaluation process appears to have the potential to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the adaptive research process. This ensures that technologies subsequently examined in trials are relevant to farmers' interests, existing systems and resources, thereby increasing the chances of farmer adoption. It is concluded that this process has potential for use with other technologies and in other farming systems. From abstract Elsevier Science Journal. </p>

					<p> On-farm experiments were conducted at Mediga and Yimtenga, Burkina Faso, to assess the impact of compost and sowing date on crop production and soil properties. No significant difference in soil organic matter content was found between treatments receiving compost and no compost. Compost application increased soil cation exchange capacity from 4 to 6 cmol/kg. Soil pH was also increased by the compost application. Sorghum yield tripled on the plots with 10 t/ha compost and increased by 45% on the 5 t/ha compost plots. Compost application mitigated the negative effects of a delay in sowing. In interviews, farmers said they were aware of the role of compost in sustaining yield and improving soil quality. Lack of equipment and adequate organic material for making compost, land tenure and the high labour requirements are major constraints for the adoption of compost technology. It was concluded that compost application could contribute to increase food availability in the Sahel, but efforts should be made to alleviate the socio-economic constraints to the adoption of compost technology.

					<p> How training in simple food processing techniques can help village farmers successfully increase their incomes and improve the nutritional status of their families is described using the case of the Integration of Tree Crops into Farming Systems Project (ITFSP). The ITFSP is a regional project with activities in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe. In 1995, the project chose Kitui District, Kenya, as a pilot area because farmers had indicated that they had difficulties marketing fresh fruit and that a large part of the mango harvest rotted in their gardens. The main techniques introduced were wooden solar dryers, and jam and juice making. Local artisans were contracted to produce the dryers. In only 2 years, ITFSP has reached out to 27 farmer groups with a total membership of 680 farmers. A cost-benefit analysis of mango drying was performed using a variable number of drying days. The variation in gross margins per working day during the 1996/1997 season was assessed. Generally, the marketing of products is greatly enhanced when producer and marketing associations are formed.</p>

					<p> By the end of the 1997/1998, which corresponds to the 4th year of market liberalization, the major sources of cotton production in Tanzania by social category of producer were determined, and the producers' market behaviour and their general perceptions of the outcome of liberalization were examined. There was almost certainly a substantial production response in 1995/1996 over 1994/1995, but it seems unlikely that this response has been subsequently amplified as liberalization has continued and as monetization of cotton sales has been institutionalized. While the decline in 1997/1998 was mainly the result of adverse weather conditions, the underlying cause for stagnation is based on a failure to shift towards more optimal farming methods, and a significant decline in non-labour input use, following a monetization of inputs supply. The ability of co-operative societies to retain market share is likely to weaken in the future, since with credit-based input supply no longer being undertaken, loyalty will lose most of its rationale. Possession of land and cattle, amount of area under cotton cultivation, cotton sales volumes, co-operative membership and marketing behaviour are all socially stratified along lines of oxen ownership/non-ownership. Little or no differentiation of farming methods based on this pattern of social stratification could be detected. </p>

					<p> Critics argue that high-external-input technologies (HEIT) are too costly for African farmers, and that programmes to promote them are economically unsustainable. The Sasakawa-Global 2000 programmes in Ethiopia and Mozambique are assessed, using financial and economic analysis, yield models, and subsector analysis. The Sasakawa-Global 2000 technology was much more profitable in Ethiopia than in Mozambique, but varied depending on production location, fertilizer and transport costs, domestic and international prices, regional surplus or deficit conditions, and production as import substitute or export. The case studies provide further evidence that HEIT can be successfully introduced through well-funded high-profile programmes, but no conclusive evidence that such programmes can be scaled up and sustained. Five major implications are discussed, concerning: (1) prospects for scaling up and sustaining HEIT adoption; (2) the need for expanded profitability analysis; (3) the role of trade prospects and policies; (4) institution-building requirements; and (5) infrastructure investments to reduce marketing costs.

					<p> A multi-market model was used to assess the potential impact of improved maize technologies on the welfare of various types of rural and urban households in Kenya. The modelling results indicate that technologies developed for high potential regions are likely to have more profound aggregate impacts on maize production and lead to greater reductions in import demand (if prices are controlled) or maize prices (if maize prices are flexible). Technology adoption in high potential regions is likely to have substantially greater positive impacts on aggregate real incomes, but inferior income distributional outcomes compared to technology adoption in marginal regions.

					<p> Multipurpose Tree (MPT) species have the ability to fit into the farming systems of the East African region where low agricultural productivity, widespread land degradation and hence a diminishing capacity to support the growing human and livestock population are major problems. Geographical information systems (GIS) technology was used to develop a spatial representation of the recommendation domains of 5 MPT species (Calliandra calothyrsus, Sesbania sesban, Leucaena diversifolia, Leucaena pallida and Cytisus palmensis (syn. Chamaecytisus palmensis)) in Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda. The recommendation domains were selected based on climatic, edaphic and topographical factors. The likelihood of adoption, within the agro-ecologically suitable areas for each species, was defined by weighing and combining 3 factors: the type of land cover and land use; human population density; and, cattle population density.

					<p> A cartographic assessment of seasonal variations in the size of home gardens was conducted in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, during 1995-1996. Data were collected using GPS (global positioning system) and analysed with GIS (geographical information system) software. It appeared that at least 48 sites in the city are utilized permanently or occasionally during the year for urban home gardening. Some sites disappear during the dry season and reappear during the rainy or cool season. There were 39 sites in April 1995 (dry season), only 15 sites in August 1995 (rainy season), 41 sites in Dec. 1995 (cool season), and then 32 sites in April 1996 (dry season). The home gardening area peaked in Dec. (approximately 175 ha), in the middle of the cool season. Thematic maps highlight the home gardening area at different sites on a seasonal basis. It is recommended to take measures for the preservation of horticulture in the urban environment. From authors' summary.    </p>

					<p> Information related to crop and livestock systems in West Africa is currently available from various sources (e.g. household surveys, aerial surveys, rural appraisal, and experiments) and held by different agencies. Such data (biophysical and socio-economic) can be integrated within a GIS (geographical information systems) environment and synthesized to identify the evolution of systems across environments and also to identify constraints and potential of the systems. The potential for integrated crop-livestock systems remains untapped and/or knowledge of its existence is unknown for large parts of Nigeria. A case study of the entire country, subdivided into the major agro-climatic zones, is presented to show how emerging crop-livestock systems can be predicted using GIS techniques, data from case studies, and geo-referenced, nationwide data on cropping intensities and animal population (cattle, sheep and goats). Data used as input included information on crop residues, farmyard manure and draught animals (animal power). The potential contribution of these research methods is largely unknown in West and Central Africa, where few operational programmes use them. Major technological innovations and appropriate government policies and regional planning have potential to shift the balance in regional developments, if targeted carefully at areas where the right conditions exist.</p>

					<p> The process of adjustment of farm performance to disequilibrium with new technology over time has long been a subject of debate. Theories of intra-firm diffusion and data from irrigated and non-irrigated rice farms in North Arcot district, Tamil Nadu, India, were used to test 2 hypotheses: (1) initial overall farm performances are characterized by modest and widely varying technical and allocative efficiencies; and (2) over time, average efficiencies rise. Left to learn from their own experience, farmers will be slow to realize the full technical potential of a new technology. From abstract Elsevier Science Journal. </p>

					<p> The gradual and difficult transformation of a sugar cane monoculture farm to an integrated and diversified farming system is described, using the case of a small family farm in the Philippine province of Negros Occidental. In 1984 the Oray family decided to change their farming practices to achieve food security for the family, to improve control of the entire production process, and to make optimal use of the natural resources available to them by nutrient cycling. The transformation involved conversion of intensively farmed sugar cane land to rice, land levelling to improve water management, direct marketing to neighbours to avoid middlemen, planting maize and vegetables for home consumption, keeping a few livestock such as a sow, some piglets, and chickens, raising a water buffalo for animal traction, extension of the farm from an initial 1.3 ha to 3.5 ha, the introduction of crop rotations based on leguminous crops such as groundnut, soybean, mung bean, and cowpea, farm forestry, the adoption of biological pest management strategies to control snail damage in rice by planting taro and dispersing rice hulls, using cassava as a catch crop to keep rats away from rice seedlings. These and other changes have made it possible for the family to meet their needs and have made life less risky than it used to be. </p>

					<p> The evolution of the shifting cultivation of the Minangkabau, the biggest matrilineal society in Indonesia, is explored, and factors underlying the instability and vulnerability of farmers' livelihoods and the degradation of their resource base are examined using an extended factor analysis technique, in order to understand how development strategies might be modified towards a more dynamic farming system. Three main phases of changes in the farming system are distinguished; these changes highly corresponded with the emerging market and institutional incentives. Furthermore, the factor analysis generated a 6-factor model suggesting strategic interventions to foster the improvement of farmers' livelihoods and environment in future. It is argued that, provided land tenure is conducive, there are substantial possibilities for policies and interventions that focus first on agricultural diversification and then on organization building, to assist in dealing with farmers' vulnerability and environmental degradation in the uplands.
