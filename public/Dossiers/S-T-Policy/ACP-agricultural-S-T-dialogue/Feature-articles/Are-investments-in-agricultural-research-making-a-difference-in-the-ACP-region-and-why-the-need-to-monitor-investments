They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	Mr Othieno lives in Busia District in Kenya. He used to grow maize to feed his family of six. Every season, he could only harvest 2 bags of maize from his acre of land. This was not enough to feed his family and send his children to school. In 2007, he participated in an on-farm evaluation of new varieties of sweet potato (orange-fleshed sweet potato). He learned that he can plant and sell seedlings of these new varieties. He became a member of an innovation platform where farmers interact with extension, researchers and agribusiness discussing farmers’ challenges and the potential for improving their livelihoods. He volunteered to be trained as a seed multiplier of the promising and proven varieties of sweet potato and, became known within his village and surrounding villages as a good source of planting materials. In 2009, he earned around US$1,000 by selling his cuttings to fellow farmers within one season. In 2010, he received new cuttings of tested varieties and earned US$1,600 within the season. With his new earnings, he is able to feed his family, send his children to school, build a new house, expand his farm and has bought 3 cows. An average African farmer earns less than a dollar a day.</p>

<p>This is just one African success story built on research achievements. An increasing number of farmers are able to interact with scientists, extension workers and agribusiness through various opportunities catalyzed and facilitated by research, education and advisory service systems. The potential impact is enormous as the changes required can be as simple as using new varieties or as complex as complying with quality standards to meet export or new market demands. East African economies are booming because of new markets for cut flowers in Europe. Rice imports are being reduced through higher yields and expanded rice acreage in West Africa, thanks to better rice varieties, improved agricultural practices and policies. Pastoralists in East Africa are able to keep healthy and productive animals, sustain farm productivity and find profitable markets for their animal products. Across Africa, farmers are able to sell their products more effectively through timely information via the use of mobile phones and internet services. As farmers become increasingly information-hungry, service provision has to improve through better targeted and coordinated services and enabling policies. </p><p>Africa is rich in land and water resources and has great potential to enhance its agricultural production to feed its own population and those of other continents through export. The Africa Progress Report for 2011 (Africa Progress Panel, 2011), released at the World Economic Forum, projects that Africa can sustain its 5.5% average growth rate for 2011 (5.8% in 2012). This is one of the highest growth rates in the world. Already Africa is expanding economic activities with Asia, diversifying from its reliance of trade with Europe. But Africa has to feed itself first and respond to its complex and diverse challenges, such as low inherent soil fertility, poor natural resources management, erratic agricultural policies, poor market access, etc. These issues become more complex with climate change, particularly for countries with minimum expertise, policies and resources to adapt and mitigate. </p><p>Agriculture remains the dominant employer for the African population of almost 1 billion, with 80% depending on agriculture as their source of income. Agriculture contributes, on average, about 30% of Africa’s gross domestic product (GDP). Since the post-colonial period, investments in agriculture have been declining, as it was not a priority. But for the past decade, this decline in interest in agriculture has started to reverse. This was catalysed by the African Heads of State (2002) declaration and endorsement of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Productivity Program (<a href="http://www.nepad-caadp.net/" target="_blank">CAADP</a>). This was intended as a tool to harmonize and coordinate investments in agriculture after the sector had been recognized as the engine of economic growth across the continent. CAADP is built on four pillars to increase agriculture productivity: </p><p>
Pillar 1: land and water management; <br/>
Pillar 2: rural infrastructure and trade-related capacities for improved market access; <br/>
Pillar 3: increasing food supply and reducing hunger; and <br/>Pillar 4: agricultural research, technology dissemination and adoption. </p><p>African Heads of State recognize that enhancement of agriculture productivity will require assistance from research, education and extension systems. Studies show that a 1% increase in crop yield has a direct impact on poverty alleviation, reducing the number of Africans living on less than US$1 per day by 2.1 million (World Bank, 2010). Rates of return on investment in research for development through national agriculture research systems (NARS) are around 50% in Africa. This is still low compared to other regions: 78% for Asia and Pacific and 53% for Latin America, with an average for developing countries of 60% (von Braun et al., 2008). It is argued that for every US$0.61 of investment in research, the output is US$1.00 (Beintema and Stads, 2011).</p><p>The three major institutions of Pillar 4 (research, education and extension) have to collaborate and work together to maximize the benefits of their inputs and products. They have to transform into a cohesive innovation system where research, education/training and advisory services complement each other to increase agriculture productivity, create an enabling policy environment and establish adequate infrastructure. The Pillar 4 institutions are also very much aware that investments in research, education/training and extension have been mostly donor-sourced or government funded. Investment from both sources has declined considerably from its 1970s levels, even with the reversed and increasing trend of the past 3-5 years. </p><p>The Africa Progress Report for 2011 shows more positive and promising trends in Africa’s economy. There is a growing demand for African commodities driven by the continent’s growing middle class, rapid urbanisation, lower public debts and a dynamic private sector. This is mostly seen in emerging African countries, notably Botswana, Cape Verde, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Seychelles, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. Most of these countries notably, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia, have sustained their investments in agricultural research for development. In most cases, some of their research institutions become innovative in sourcing sustained funding. Kenya’s leading research institution (Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (<a href="http://www.kari.org/" target="_blank">KARI</a>) leveraged increased government funding to sustain donor support, but also expanded its partnership with the private sector through more demand-driven research. Côte d’Ivoire has semi-privatized its research institution, Centre National de Recherche Agronomique (<a href="http://www.cnra.ci" target="_blank">CNRA</a>). During the civil crisis, the research institution was able to sustain its research through private sector investment, mainly from farmer cooperatives seeking research developments to improve their agricultural productivity. </p><p>Despite these positive changes, investments in agricultural research, education/training and extension have to be diversified to increase their effectiveness and efficiency. Reasons for this are articulated in a framework developed by the Forum for Agricultural Research for Africa (<a href="http://www.fara-africa.org/" target="_blank">FARA</a>), namely the Framework for Africa Agriculture Productivity (FAAP) – see Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (2006). This is a direct response to the call of CAADP on Pillar 4. The FAAP is a tool to ensure harmonized and coordinated political, technical and financial support to agriculture research, education/training and advisory service systems. It enumerates principles to be practiced by all concerned institutions to ensure that their programmes are geared towards farmer empowerment, which is the basic element required to achieve sustained economic growth in Africa. </p><p>
As the CAADP Pillar 4 lead institution, FARA mobilizes and advocates all concerned actors: from the African farmer to the European investor. Its most recent achievement is a Ministerial Dialogue on Agriculture, Science and Technology in April 2011 (Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa, 2011). The dialogue confirmed commitments from African Ministers to sustain their investments and priorities in agricultural development. It also reiterated that such investments require development-oriented service provision by research, education/training and advisory services. <br/>Given such progress and continuing challenges, it is important to have a better monitoring system for research investments from different sources, such as government, donor agencies, private sector or stakeholder groups. Having the right monitoring system can be an important tool to ensure balance between divergent interests of investors and Pillar 4 institutions. Most investors would like to see an immediate impact from their money (value for money). Strategic research can lead to breakthroughs, but it is often difficult to show impact, at least in the short run. At the same time, researchers cannot be responsible for impact, as it depends on too many factors outside their control. </p><p>For these diverging interests to work, a shared understanding of the following points is needed:</p>
<ul>

<li>research investments have to show value for money, allowing for the fact that some research is abstract and that it is difficult to measure direct impact;</li>

<li>research should function in an innovation systems environment, where learning is important for continuous relevance and improvement by diverse actors/institutions within complex environment;</li>

<li>there is a lack of monitoring mechanisms assessing government commitments in agriculture, particularly agricultural research; </li>

<li>research is a long-term investment that requires sustained resources.</li>

</ul>
<p>Strategies to enhance investment should aim for scale, quality, and efficiency of use and stability of investments. This can be achieved by diversifying sources of funding, improving targeting of investments for higher returns and assured implementation capacity. With this, we could see more farmers like Mr Othieno in Africa. </p><p>Already it is projected that by 2015, 221 million additional Africans will enter the market for consumer goods; Africa’s GDP is expected to reach $2.6 trillion in 2020, with consumer spending of $1.4 trillion (Gaibi et al., 2010). “What was termed 'the hopeless continent' 10 years ago has now unquestionably become the continent of hope,” says Kofi Annan (Africa Progress Panel, 2011). This would not have been achieved without investing in agricultural research. </p><p><b>References</b></p><p>
