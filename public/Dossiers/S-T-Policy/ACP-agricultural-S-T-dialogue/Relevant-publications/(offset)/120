						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	This paper by K. Graham and R. Vignola (from the Overseas Development Institute, ODI) outlines the linkages between forests and agriculture, and the need for national level REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, with the + referring to forest conservation, sustainable forest management and carbon stock enhancement) policies and programmes to effectively address agriculture as a driver of deforestation and forest degradation, and ensure that local level food security is not compromised. It examines a number of policy approaches (that may form part of a REDD+ strategy) to address deforestation and forest degradation caused by the expansion of agriculture. The agriculture sector and forests are intrinsically linked, most obviously through their direct competition for land. The authors argue that to harmonise agricultural and REDD+ policy goals, agricultural intensification will be necessary, but not sufficient. They believe that in the absence of other policy and regulatory measures to reduce deforestation, intensification is very unlikely to reduce pressure on forests, and most likely only large scale land use planning will be essential in identifying areas for specific “place based” policies to support REDD+ objectives.  The paper discusses the potential policy options as well as some potential socio-economic impacts (for subsistence as well as commercial farmers) and how policy design and targeted REDD+ revenues can be used to mitigate them.(<a href="http://redd-net.org/files/REDD%20and%20agriculture%20laid%20up.pdf" target="_blank">REDD-net.org</a>, August 2011) </p>

					<p><i>By Gert-Jan Stads and Louis Sene; IFPRI, 2011.</i>Agricultural research and development (R&amp;D) in Senegal has historically been spearheaded by the public sector. In 2008, the private sector accounted for just 14 percent of the country’s total (public and private) agricultural R&amp;D investments. While the public sector dominates R&amp;D related to food crops, private-sector companies play a key role when it comes to export commodities, including cotton, groundnuts, and fisheries and horticultural products. Although data on public R&amp;D capacity and investments are widely available, comprehensive information on R&amp;D conducted by the private sector is not regularly documented. This paper attempts to fill this knowledge gap with new data and analysis on private R&amp;D investment in Senegalese agriculture. In doing so, the paper also provides insights into policy and institutional issues constraining private investment, and options for addressing these constraints.

					<p><i>By A. Ely, P. Van Zwanenberg, A. Stirling; STEPS Centre Working Paper 45; 2011.</i><i> </i><a href="http://www.steps-centre.org/PDFs/Technology_Assessment.pdf" target="_blank">This study</a> explores the role that ‘new models’ of technology assessment can play in improving the lives of poor and vulnerable populations in the developing world. The new models addressed here combine citizen and decision-maker participation with technical expertise. Technology assessment (TA) involves the collection, interpretation and evaluation of information and perspectives around contending technological options. In the absence of TA, technologies may fail to serve their desired function, or create unforeseen negative impacts. This report examines the utility of these new models of TA in a broad range of geographical contexts, and the extent they can be applied to improve the lives of poor and vulnerable populations in the developing world. Drawing on lessons from the past, and paying attention to recent experiences with a variety of approaches, the report highlights how the new models of technology assessment can contribute to development goals and suggests how particular components of the new methods and processes might work well in developing countries.</p>

This report analyses 12 land deals and their wider legal frameworks. A number of the contracts reviewed appear to be short, unspecific documents that grant long-term rights to extensive areas of land, and in some cases priority rights over water, in exchange for seemingly little public revenue and/or apparently vague promises of investment and/or jobs. Also, a number of the deals are being negotiated in legal contexts where safeguards for local interests are weak, and some contracts appear not to properly address social and environmental issues. Some contracts do however feature better terms: such as better distributed revenues, international social and environmental on-farm standards, more flexible duration, clearer identification of the land being transacted, specific investor commitments on jobs, training, local procurement and local processing, greater attention to local food security, and their tighter social and environmental safeguards.</p>

It examines the role transnational corporations (TNCs) play in the funding, via direct investments, of the agricultural sector in developing countries. This policy paper consists of four sections. The first reiterates the benefits of sound private-sector investment in sustainable food security; it also explains the paper’s primary focus on investments from TNCs and describes how TNCs approach decisions on investment allocations. The second section highlights examples of TNC investments that have simultaneously benefited smallholders in developing countries while creating profits for the investors. The third section explores how the US government engages with TNCs and incentivizes investments. The final section concludes with recommendations for TNCs, governments, and other players, with a view towards increasing TNC investments that both strengthen agricultural development and offer profits to TNCs.</p>

	This study examines the interactions among agricultural mechanization, food production and agricultural development of the Asia-Pacific region. Six countries were chosen for case studies, namely Bangladesh, China, India, Republic of Korea, Thailand and the Philippines, representing different stages of agricultural mechanization. Through visits and talks with policy makers, researchers and the private sector in the six countries, and thorough review of country reports prepared by representatives to the Technical Committee of United Nations Asian and Pacific Centre for Agricultural Engineering and Machinery (UNAPCAEM), the authors have collected extensive data and information on agricultural mechanization, and conducted thorough analysis. The study identifies the main characteristics of agricultural mechanization of each country, and assesses their respective needs in agricultural mechanization. The study also explores the feasibility of establishing an ‘Asia Pacific Network for Testing Agricultural Machinery’ (ANTAM). The feasibility study on the establishment of “ANTAM” is an important part of this report. “ANTAM” is proposed with an aim to promote introduction of uniform testing procedures and safety standards of agricultural machinery, and facilitate intraregional trade.

					<p><i><b>World Bank’s ‘Rwanda Economic Update’ April 2011: Focus on agriculture</b></i>The Rwanda Economic Update reports and synthesizes key economic developments in the past six months in Rwanda’s economy. It places them in a medium-term and regional context, and will increasingly assess the implications of these developments and policies for the outlook of Rwanda’s economy. The current edition of the Rwanda Economic Update is titled Seeds for Higher Growth and specially features the agriculture sector. The agriculture feature of this Update edition outlines key channels through which agriculture contributes to the economy. The second part of the Update provides the regular overview of recent macroeconomic developments. While the special feature on agriculture will analyze the evolving role of the sector over the past five years, the second part on recent economic developments will focus on events during 2010. <i>Afrique en ligne</i> relays <i>The New Times</i> (Rwanda’s national newspaper) article (dated 3 May 2011) on the report. <a href="http://www.afriquejet.com/news/africa-news/horticulture-can-ease-dependence-on-coffee,-tea--world-bank-report-rwanda-2011050310569.html" target="_blank">http://www.afriquejet.com/news/africa-news/horticulture-can-ease-dependence-on-coffee,-tea--world-bank-report-rwanda-2011050310569.html</a> 
In the report, the World Bank advises Rwanda to diversify commercial agriculture to reduce her heavy reliance on tea and coffee. According the authors of the report, Rwanda needs to actively invest in non-traditional export crops, such as fruits, vegetables, cut flowers, essential oils and silk.Below is the report.<a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTRWANDA/Resources/Rwanda_Economic_Rwanda_Update_Spring_Edition_April_2011.pdf" target="_blank">http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTRWANDA/Resources/Rwanda_Economic_Rwanda_Update_Spring_Edition_April_2011.pdf</a>

An agenda for action and a framework to guide the efforts of stakeholders, with a key focus on visions, policies, strategies and institutions for Africa’s agribusiness development, is also outlined. A key part of the study is the identification and analysis of the seven development pillars for agribusiness development, which are the actions needed to transform subsistence agriculture into productive agribusiness, as follows: enhancing agricultural productivity; upgrading value chains; exploiting local, regional and international demand; strengthening technological effort and innovation capabilities; promoting effective and innovative financing; stimulating private participation; and improving infrastructure and energy access.

In particular the study focuses on eight target countries (Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Sudan), related RIAs and a set of strategic food commodities.The evidence presented in this study shows that African countries have made progress in opening up agriculture and food trade with partner countries. With, the exception of Ghana, Tanzania and Mozambique, the effective applied tariff rates for regional trade partners are substantially lower than the rates applied to world trade partners. Nonetheless, regional trade in agriculture and food only increased marginally between 1990 and 2009, and is relatively low in comparison with other developing regions. The weak state of soft and hard infrastructure, rather than high trade tariffs, seem to be the cause of this.<a href="http://purl.umn.edu/101645" target="_blank">http://purl.umn.edu/101645</a><a href="http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/101645" target="_blank">http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/101645</a></p>

	The <i>Suwon Agrobiodiversity Framework</i> (<a href="http://goo.gl/8OKgp" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/8OKgp</a>) is the result of discussions held in Korea at the “Sustainable Agriculture Development and Use of Agrobiodiversity in the Asia-Pacific Region” International Symposium in October 2010. The symposium provided an opportunity to review, identify, and redefine the role and directions of agricultural R&amp;D, especially in the context of conservation through use of valuable agrobiodiversity for sustainable agricultural development. It did also set a vision for the access and the benefit sharing of valuable genetic resources. To address the questions at hand, the organizations thought best to adopt an integrated systems approach while defining the framework: research and S&amp;T developments are to focus on genetic resources, conservation techniques, traditional knowledge, ecosystem services, and rely on information and communication systems to enhance regional collaboration.

	Norway is reviewing its research system through the “Fagerberg Committee”. One study commissioned by the committee compares the research system in seven countries, with an emphasis on publically financed research. The comparison of the countries uses seven criteria to assess what instruments offer most value for money. Relevant data suggest a declining role of basic research in the sense of 'blue skies' (curiosity-driven) research.
 Looking at who decides the research topics reveals that any drift away from basic research is the choice of the research community itself: the share of researcher-initiated project funding is clearly rising.The first publication volume of the research, Research Support for the Fagerberg Committee - International comparison of goal-oriented public governance in research policy, can be downloaded at <a href="http://goo.gl/uR7Hp" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/uR7Hp</a>.Public funding allocation to the main research sectors is described and allocation patterns mapped over time. It also gives information on research spending versus research administration, examines research recruitment, identifies mechanisms and criteria for public research allocation, and in particular how targets are operationalised. It also covers a review of bibliometric systems developed for cataloguing research production (number and level of publications, quotations indexes) and gives some best cases examples.
 Comparative data for the seven countries studied appears in a second volume, which can be downloaded at <a href="http://goo.gl/qm8cM" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/qm8cM</a>. Such a review exercise should help other countries assess their research system, relevant in the current context of research policy reviews taking place in several regions of the world.</p>

	The Centre for Higher Education Transformation (CHET, South Africa) has published a synthesis report drawing together evidence from eight African case studies that formed part of the Higher Education Research and Advocacy Network in Africa project (HERANA, <a href="http://chet.org.za/programmes/herana/" target="_blank">http://chet.org.za/programmes/herana/</a>). The HERANA research surveyed higher education stakeholders in eight African countries: Botswana, Ghana, Nairobi (Kenya), Mauritius, Eduardo Mondlane (Mozambique), Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), Makerere (Uganda), Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University and the University of Cape Town Both in South Africa).The study revealed that flagship universities in these eight African countries are more similar to institutions elsewhere than is generally perceived, with well-qualified staff, positive student-to-staff ratios, and rising enrolments including in science, engineering and technology.

	This paper surveys the literature and identifies different ways of assessing the impact of ‘policy-oriented’ research. It then takes the available literature on agriculture as a specific focus of study. The author examine the different types of ‘policy-oriented’ research; the literature on the ‘theories of change‘ for policy research in international development; methodologies for analysing the impact of policy-oriented research; the relevant agriculture literature and outlines the types of indicators that can be used for impact assessment of research with examples.More than ever before, every dollar spent on development research will have to count towards sustainable poverty reduction. However, the understanding of the impacts of development research on policy change and on poverty is weak at best, with agriculture being no different. The area of research impact is not a new area of enquiry but an emergent one.(Reference: Edoardo Masset, Rajendra Mulmi and Andy Sumner; IDS Working Papers 360; 2011)<a href="http://www.ntd.co.uk/idsbookshop/details.asp?id=1220" target="_blank">http://www.ntd.co.uk/idsbookshop/details.asp?id=1220</a></p>

	Building Competitiveness in Africa's Agriculture: a guide to value chain concepts and applications</b><i>Webber, C. Martin; and Labaste, Patrick. World Bank, 2010</i>Abstract:The development and business communities recently have experienced a tremendous resurgence of interest in promoting value chains development as a way to add value, lower transaction costs, diversify rural economies, and contribute to increasing rural household incomes. This Guide is designed for those who want to know more about value chain-based approaches and how to use them in ways that can contribute to sound operational decisions, improved market linkages, and results for enterprise and industry development.Using real examples, mostly from African countries, this book reviews and illustrates a range of concepts, analytical tools, and methodologies centered on the value chain that can be used to design, implement, and evaluate agricultural and agribusiness development initiatives that strive to enhance productivity and competitiveness.<a href="http://www.technoserve.org/assets/documents/building-comp.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.technoserve.org/assets/documents/building-comp.pdf</a></p>

					<p>Author: <b>Jakob Edler, 2010, University of Manchester, Manchester Business School (MBS).</b>Abstract: <b>International policy coordination for collaboration in S&amp;T</b>This paper discusses an increasingly important, yet challenging development, the international coordination of nationally rooted policies or funding schemes to support international collaboration in science and technology (S&amp;T). It conceptualizes ways in which government ministries or agencies can realise synergies when it comes to supporting international activities of their researchers. Although the principles developed for international coordination can be generalized, it is set in the context of the European Research Area (ERA). Existing conceptual and empirical analysis has shown that coordination of policy to foster international S&amp;T collaboration is by and large rather poor even domestically. The paper argues that international coordination of national policies for international S&amp;T collaboration meets an additional set of challenges that need to be tackled systematically. The conceptual considerations presented in this chapter can lay the basis for an analysis of current coordination activities. They can, however, also be utilised to design systematic coordination schemes for policies geared towards international collaboration as they provide the major elements of strategic approach for such an international coordination approach.Consult <a href="http://www.mbs.ac.uk/cgi/apps/research/working-papers/view/?wId=197" target="_blank">MBS Working paper series</a>.</p>

	Innovation, Sustainability, Development: A New Manifesto</i> recommends new ways of linking science and innovation to development for a more sustainable, equitable and resilient future.It was produced by the 'Social, Technological and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability' Centre (STEPS), an interdisciplinary global research and policy engagement hub that unites development studies with science and technology studies. While acknowledging that future generations face huge social, environmental and economic challenges, and noting that global governance, economics and people work against the interest of poorer countries and people, the STEPS Centre proposes that science, technology and innovation must play essential roles in meeting the moral and political imperative of addressing the interlinked global challenges. The new manifesto recognizes the need for a new politics of innovation which responds to “which science?”, “what technologies? ‘and “what kinds of change?”. They call for greater respect cultural variety, regional diversity and democratic accountability and opening up of the political space and debate for more deliberation on styles and directions for research and innovation. They propose that radical changes be made to the way in which innovation is shaped through: agenda setting, funding, capacity building, organizational arrangements and monitoring, evaluation and accountability.</p>
