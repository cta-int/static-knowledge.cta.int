						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>A.D. Alene, V.M. Manyong, J. Gockowski, O. Coulibaly and S. AbeleInternational Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, Nigeria2004Assessing the impact of agricultural research can assist with setting priorities, providing feedback to the research programmes, and demonstrating actual benefits of the products of agricultural research. Towards this end, many national and international agricultural research centres have institutionalized impact assessment. However, a number of conceptual and operational difficulties remain that limit the scope and depth of impact assessment work. The objective of <a href="http://www.iita.org/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=f5960ba3-b769-406d-a60c-d2183d18f853&amp;groupId=25357" target="_blank">this document</a> is to develop a framework for conceptualizing and promoting impact assessment in agricultural research. First, the linkages between agricultural research and rural livelihoods and the implications for evaluating the impact of agricultural technologies are illustrated, using the sustainable rural livelihood framework. Secondly, a strategy for institutionalizing an appropriate data system is proposed to make impact assessment an integral part of the agricultural research process. To operationalize the data system, data sheets for each stage of the impact assessment process are developed to guide researchers in gathering relevant and adequate information relating to each agricultural technology. Implementation of data systems requires biophysical and social scientists to work jointly towards generating and maintaining data for impact assessment.</p>

					<p>P.G. Pardey, N. Beintema, S. Dehmer and S. WoodInternational Food Policy Research Institute, Washington, D.C., USA2006Sustained, well-targeted, and effectively used investments in R&amp;D have reaped handsome rewards from improved agricultural productivity and cheaper, higher quality foods and fibres. The global patterns of investments in agricultural R&amp;D are changing in ways that may have profound consequences for the structure of agriculture worldwide and the ability of poor people in poor counties to feed themselves. This report documents and discusses these changing investment patterns, highlighting developments in the public and private sectors. It revises and carries forward to 2000 data that were previously reported in the 2001 IFPRI Food Policy Report <i>Slow Magic: Agricultural R&amp;D a Century After Mendel. </i>Some past trends are continuing or have come into sharper focus, while others are moving in new directions not apparent in the previous series.

					<p>Task Force on Impact Assessment and Evaluation, European Initiative for Agricultural Research for Development (EIARD) EIARD, European Commission, Brussels, Belgium2007For EIARD, impact assessments and evaluations have four main objectives: (a) to enhance the developmental impact of agricultural research investments for poor people; (b) to provide information on the returns to investments in agricultural research for development; (c) to derive strategic and programmatic lessons for future investments in agricultural research for development; and (d) to provide information for use in public awareness work. These objectives suggest three sets of issues. First, if the main objective of impact assessment and evaluation is to increase the developmental impact of research, it is important to recognize and address the complex social, economic and political dimensions of pro-poor innovation. Thus, impact assessments and evaluations should not be limited to directly measurable impacts; they should seek to capture the complexity and non-linear nature of agricultural innovation and sustainable development. Impact assessments and evaluations should also be integrated as far as possible into research programmes, to facilitate internal learning processes and changes that enhance the probability of impact. Second, the difficulty of attributing impact to specific research investments requires special attention. In agricultural research organizations, exhaustive analysis of specific innovation processes is rarely possible because it is extremely difficult, costly, and time consuming. In most cases, a more feasible goal is to establish plausible links between research investments and development impacts. Third, for impact assessments and evaluations to be useful for decision making, policy design, learning, and public awareness, stakeholder interests and intentions need to be assessed, and appropriate information needs to be prepared for different audiences. It is also important to integrate evaluation lessons with other forms of learning. <a href="http://www.eiard.org/media/uploads/File/documents/impact_assessment_paper-1(1).pdf" target="_blank">View PDF</a></p>

					<p>Food and Agriculture Organization, Rome, Italy2008A sequential approach is needed for <i>ex post</i> impact assessment (epIA). Economic rate of return assessments (ERRAs) and multi-dimensional impact assessments (MDIAs) are discussed. The former focus on Stage I outcomes and closely related impacts to adopters while the latter focus on Stage II impacts further along the impact pathway. In general, Stage I epIAs that focus on direct effects to adopters should be rigorously carried out before other consequences along the impact pathway are evaluated in the usually more costly and specialized Stage II epIAs. MDIAs are a priority for research areas where economic rate of return assessments have already been carried out. For research areas where sufficient success has yet to be recorded, economic rate of return assessment remains the priority. The depth of epIA must be enhanced via the ‘input–output–outcome–impact’ pathway. Successful epIAs focus on the purpose of the intervention and on a small subset of intended and unintended consequences further down the impact pathway. Purposes should represent intermediate outputs that are characterized in the literature by well-established empirical linkages to the MDGs. Better preparation is needed for conducting epIAs. Data from the increasingly available national surveys on household income and consumption expenditure often represent underutilized resources that could contribute to more informative epIAs, and practitioners should become more familiar them. Ways to enhance the poverty assessment content of ERRAs include: (1) Estimating the importance of an intervention’s net benefits on the incomes of poor beneficiary households, (2) Eliciting human interest stories, and (3) The qualitative assessment of key poverty aspects that condition the consequences of and contextualize the research intervention. <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/011/i0276e/i0276e00.htm" target="_blank">View document</a></p>

					<p>R. Mackay and D. Horton<i>Agricultural Systems</i> 78: 143–1652003The rationale behind conducting impact assessment studies is the expectation that the findings will be used to bring about improvements in policies and programmes and thereby contribute to economic and social betterment. <a href="http://www.prgaprogram.org/descargas/impact_assessment/recommended_impact_studies/Expanding%20the%20use%20of%20impact%20assessment%20and%20evaluation%20in%20agricultural%20research%20and%20development.pdf" target="_blank">This paper</a> addresses a number of issues related to why impact assessments and other kinds of evaluations are not always utilized in this way. Any particular impact assessment falls along a continuum between academic research at one extreme and utilization-focused evaluation at the other. It is argued that impact assessment studies may enjoy greater use by decision makers if they are managed as evaluations conducted towards the utilization-focused end of the continuum. Several factors that influence the use of evaluations are discussed. These include the type of potential use and intended users; the nature of decision-making; factors over and above information that affect how decisions are made; and the various decision levels where evaluations may be used. Direct, indirect and symbolic uses of evaluations are also discussed. Six trends within the professional evaluation community that tend to enhance the use of evaluation are described. Finally, practical suggestions are offered for enhancing the usefulness and use of impact assessments and other evaluations within the agricultural research and development community.</p>

					<p>Workgroup on Assessing the Impact of Agricultural Research in Development:H. Baur, M. Bosch, S. Krall, T. Kuby, A. Lobb-Rabe, P.-T. Schütz and A. Springer-HeinzeDeutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) GmbH, Germany2001On the basis of an IITA impact study, <a href="http://www.gtz.de/de/dokumente/en-beaf-establishing-plausability-in-impact-assessment.pdf" target="_blank">this paper </a>demonstrates the importance of establishing plausible linkages between development cooperation interventions and the relevant changes observed on the ground when assessing impact. It also proposes standards for establishing plausibility in this context. Experience has shown that impact evaluators often try to prove or quantify impact on a highly-aggregated level. However, this paper contends that in most cases, attribution gaps caused by the existence of too many other significant factors make it impossible to isolate the effects of a single development intervention. The authors maintain that, for most development interventions, to require impact evaluators to establish more than plausible impact relationships would force them to gloss over much information and over-interpret the data.</p>

					<p>Enabling small-scale farmers to engage in global markets for their produce is a pressing issue for many countries. Sustainability certification schemes such as organic, Fairtrade, Rainforest Alliance, Utz Certified and CAFÉ Practices can help small-scale farmers access new export markets. But do certification schemes and labelling strategies for products from particular geographical areas deliver benefits to poor and marginalised farmers? Using a review of the evidence and new case studies, this report by IIED tries to answer the question by giving an assessment of the relevance of certification schemes for coffee, tea and cotton farmers in China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam.

					<p>It has often been argued that new agricultural technologies lead to poverty reduction. This paper argues that any changes in poverty situation attributed to those who adopt new agricultural technology (treatment group) without a counterfactual comparison of carefully selected nonadopters (control group) are likely to be questionable. The paper estimates the effects of new agricultural technology on poverty reduction by employing the “double difference” method on data collected in rural Nigeria. Seeing the agricultural technology–poverty linkage through the lenses of adopters and nonadopters of such new technology provides understanding of the relationship between agricultural technology and poverty. The paper finds that differences in poverty status between adopters and nonadopters of new agricultural technologies (a combination of tube wells and pumps) introduced in rural Nigeria in the late 1980s and early 1990s are alarmingly modest. The paper concludes that new agricultural technology would not expressly lead to poverty reduction in poor countries. The exact channels through which new agricultural technology impact poverty outcomes need to be further explored.Author: O. Babatunde, IFPRI discussion paper, September 2009</p>

	The purpose of this guideline (published by the Inter-American Development Bank) is to provide suggestions on designing impact evaluations for agricultural projects, particularly projects that directly target farmers, and seek to improve agricultural production, productivity and profitability. Specific issues in evaluating agricultural projects are addressed, including the need to use production-based indicators and to carefully consider indirect or spillover effects that are common in agricultural projects. The guideline considers the challenges of conducting impact evaluations of agricultural projects as well as the methods for assessing impact. Issues of collecting agricultural data for an impact evaluation and how to put together the overall design strategy in an evaluation plan are also covered. The guideline concludes with three case studies of impact evaluations designed for a technology adoption project in the Dominican Republic, a forestry/technology project in Nicaragua, and a crop insurance project in Peru.

The new models addressed here combine citizen and decision-maker participation with technical expertise. Technology assessment (TA) involves the collection, interpretation and evaluation of information and perspectives around contending technological options. In the absence of TA, technologies may fail to serve their desired function, or create unforeseen negative impacts. This report examines the utility of these new models of TA in a broad range of geographical contexts, and the extent they can be applied to improve the lives of poor and vulnerable populations in the developing world. Drawing on lessons from the past, and paying attention to recent experiences with a variety of approaches, the report highlights how the new models of technology assessment can contribute to development goals and suggests how particular components of the new methods and processes might work well in developing countries.</p>

However, farmers’ awareness of and demand for the soil testing service is low. Given that the agri-clinic programme is a private form of advisory services; its success depends, among other things, on farmers’ willingness to pay for soil testing services. Farmers who have tested their soil and followed the advice of the soil testing service provider are willing to pay more for the service.

					<p> How to reduce hunger and poverty, improve rural livelihoods, and facilitate equitable, environmentally, socially and economically sustainable development through the generation, access to, and use of agricultural knowledge, science and technology? 
The goal is to provide decision makers with the information they need to reduce hunger and poverty, improve rural livelihoods, and facilitate equitable, environmentally, socially and economically sustainable development through the generation, access to, and use of agricultural knowledge, science and technology. The Assessment would take interlinked short, medium and long-term perspectives(up to 2050) and use a multi-disciplinary approach to address the full range of agricultural products (crops, livestock, fisheries, forests, fiber, and biomass) and services. It would assess the economic, environmental, health and social (including gender) implications of current and potential future technologies. It would assess what can be learnt from the past by providing a critical retrospective of agricultural science and technology and the effectiveness of institutional arrangements, as well as focus on critical areas identified during the consultative process in relation to a plausible range of future scenarios. They include issues within the domain of global public goods that require international collaboration and discussion and issues characterized by rapidly changing contexts. The Assessment would be multi-scale, addressing global and sub-global (community to regional) issues. The global Assessment would address issues with broad relevance and would be interlinked with the sub-global (community to regional) Assessments. These sub-global Assessments, which would vary in scale from the continental to community level, would use a consistent methodology, cover a range of agro-ecological systems, and employ selection criteria that would take into account socio-economic and institutional conditions, and poverty mapping.  <a href="http://www.farmingsolutions.org/pdfdb/finalreport.pdf" target="_blank">An assessment of agricultural science and technology for development</a> </p>

It shows that while CA is a viable option to achieve sustainable and intensive crop production, its success mostly results from the permanent presence of organic mulch on the soil surface and the incorporation of cover crops in the rotations. Thus, applying CA principles requires a significant reorganisation of the production process at farm level, and when facing technical or socioeconomic constraints, most farmers usually opt for applying only partially the three main principles of conservation agriculture. The authors point to further investigations into the consequences of such partial implementation of conservation agriculture principles on its actual efficiency.(CIRAD, 09/2012)</p>

					<p>This synthesis paper by university researchers from Norway and Denmark is an analysis of how resilience theory can be applied to agroecosystems. Building on the premise that agroecosystems are too complex for resilience to be measured in any precise manner, the authors have delineated behaviour-based indicators of resilience within agroecosystems. They discuss an index of 13 such indicators, which, when identified in an agroecosystem, suggest that it is resilient and endowed with the capacity for adaptation and transformation (examples of such indicators are connectedness, self-regulation, functional diversity, spatiotemporal heterogeneity). Absence of these indicators can help identify points of intervention for stakeholders to build resilience where there is vulnerability.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seachangecop.org/node/1141" target="_blank">http://www.seachangecop.org/node/1141</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;(SEA Change CoP, 2012)&nbsp;</p>

					<p>This ASTI report by IFPRI presents econometric data on total public agricultural R&amp;D spending in Asia–Pacific and related agricultural research indicators over the period ranging from 1996 to 2008. The only ACP country included in the sample is Papua New Guinea, where public agricultural R&amp;D spending decreased by almost half over the study period (so too did the share of AgGDP spent on R&amp;D). Nevertheless, more researchers have been hired by National Agricultural Research Institute (NARI), and in 2010, more women researchers worked there than in 2002 (though the absolute share of women scientists decreased). Almost 30% of PNG’s agricultural scientists employed in the public sector are aged 31 or under. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.asti.cgiar.org/publications/asia-pacific-regional-synthesis" target="_self">http://www.asti.cgiar.org/publications/asia-pacific-regional-synthesis</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(ASTI IFPRI, 07/2013)</p>

					<p>Researchers with InSTePP (International Science &amp; Technology Practice &amp; Policy) at the University of Minnesota have compiled a comprehensive database of rate of return (RR) estimates from the worldwide literature on food and agricultural R&amp;D. They found that the wide dispersion in the reported RR makes it difficult to discern meaningful patterns in the evidence. Nonetheless, RR values based on the internal rate of return (IRR) were high regardless of the type of research, commodity focus, performer, or time period of the research. The authors question whether this IRR evidence should be taken at face value: they show that high IRR values and their implausible implications are the result flawed assumptions used in calculations. They suggest alternatives that utilise more appropriate assumptions and yield more sensible implications. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://harvestchoice.org/publications/returns-food-and-agricultural-rd-investments-worldwide-1958-2011" target="_self">http://harvestchoice.org/publications/returns-food-and-agricultural-rd-investments-worldwide-1958-2011</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(HarvestChoice, 10/2013)</p>

					<p>The FAO <i>Guidelines for assessing nutrition-related knowledge, attitudes and practices</i> is a reference guide and practical tool for conducting high-quality surveys of nutrition- and health-related knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) at the community level. The manual is written for people in charge of planning, implementing and evaluating food security and nutrition projects; these include project managers, nutritionists, health workers, planning and evaluation specialists and many others. The manual includes definitions and key indicators for nutrition- and health-related knowledge, attitudes and practices. It provides useful guidance for planning and conducting a KAP survey, and for analysing and reporting the survey results. The manual also provides model questionnaires (modules) to help standardise survey efforts across the world. &nbsp; &nbsp;(<a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3545e/i3545e00.htm " target="_self">FAO</a>, 2014) &nbsp;</p>

	In May 2014 the DRUSSA programme (Development&nbsp; Research Uptake in Sub-Saharan Africa) released the summary report of its second comprehensive survey among the participating 24 African universities, covering institutional priorities, policies for research, staffing for research management and uptake, and current research and research uptake activities. The report compares the universities’ 2014 responses to a 2012 survey and begins to map evidence of change of institutional research uptake capacity. Key findings include: strong leadership for institutionalisation; more dedicated posts, incentives for partnerships, and mechanism to assess impact; slow progress in putting recording systems in place; and low capacity in science communication and dissemination. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://goo.gl/zZv4ei " target="_self">DRUSSA</a>, 06/05/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>There is scant empirical evidence of potential synergies across sectors; agriculture, nutrition and health or about the mix of actions that best supports all three. This paper proposes a typology of interventions and a metric of integration among them to help researchers build on each other's results, to inform the design of multi-sector interventions. The typology recognizes the importance of regional effect modifiers that are not themselves subject to randomized assignment, and trade-offs in how policies and programmes are implemented, evaluated and scaled. Using this typology could facilitate methodological pluralism, helping researchers in one field use knowledge generated elsewhere, each using the most appropriate method for their situation. &nbsp;(<i>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</i>, 26/02/2014)</p>
