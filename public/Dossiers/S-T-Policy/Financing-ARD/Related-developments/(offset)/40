						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	The Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund (AECF) has launched a new funding window for 'Research into Business', aiming to catalyse the private sector's ability to bridge the gap between agricultural research and the small holder farmer. This new funding programme will focus on putting into practices new crop varieties, pest and disease control methods and better irrigation techniques. It is estimated that over the next 5 years the ‘Research into Business’ initiative will directly benefit 750 000 people, 60% of whom are living on less than $2 per day. It is predicted that the new technologies brought to agribusinesses by this initiative will drive their growth up by 5% every two years. (Source: R4D, 3 March 2010)</p>

					<p>Cassava has long been known, albeit wrongly, as a poor man’s crop. Not many are aware of its importance as raw material in the textile, food, pharmaceutical, packaging, and cosmetics industries. In countries of sub-Saharan Africa where cassava is commonly grown, its alternative uses could spur economic growth and development. A four-year project funded by the Common Fund for Commodities (CFC) and implemented by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) hopes to realize this potential through the promotion of the production and use of High Quality Cassava Flour (HQCF). The US$4.5 million initiative covers 9000 small-scale farmers and processors in Zambia, Madagascar, and Tanzania, and will be supervised by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

A decline in direct investment and possible cuts in overseas aid pose a serious challenge for African governments. Ezin said the future lies in focusing on Africa–Africa cooperation and said that the Pan-African University (see <a href="http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/Pan-African-University-could-launch-early-next-year" target="_blank">Pan-African University could launch early next year</a>) will be one of the surviving projects.</p>

					<p>2009 marks the end of an era in agricultural research. Not only has Nobel Prize-winning agronomist Norman Borlaug died, but the network of research centres with which he was closely associated is in the throes of radical reform. As concerns about rising food demands grow, CGIAR has responded to its long-felt need to change how it operates. In the early 2000s, it created a Science Council to prioritise agricultural research across the developing world and fit its collective research into a neat structure. This having failed, CGIAR this year launched a more ambitious and comprehensive reform agenda. The reform aims to provide a strategic focus and make research more efficient and relevant, boosting its impact. CGIAR also hopes to simplify its governance, enhance decentralised decision-making and provide new funding options for programmes — with plans to double its income from the current US$530 million annual budget for all 15 centres, to US$1 billion. This article questions whether this reform will be succesful. (Source: Scidev, 12 October 2009)</p>

	The EU Commissioner for Science and Research Janez Potoènik paid an official visit to the AU and Kenya from 7 to 9 September, during which he held high-level political meetings and visited EU-supported research centres in Nairobi (Kenya) and in Addis-Ababa (Ethiopia). This visit took place in the framework of the Science &amp; Technology Partnership established between the AU and the EU in December 2007. ‘Science is not a luxury for Africa but crucial to finding sustainable solutions to the many challenges Africa faces. The S&amp;T partnership puts EU-AU cooperation on new footing: a true partnership of equals where the EU works not so much for Africa as with Africa. Africans decide their own research priorities and together, we will build a strong research capacity that can encourage and retain local talent and attract foreign scientists’, stated Commissioner Potoènik. He added: ‘The partnership involves the 53 AU member states and the 27 EU member states. I will highlight the need to further coordinate the efforts of these 80 states to ensure that this partnership will make a difference.’ (Source: Afrol News, 7 September 2009)</p>

					<p>This paper, which is published by GFAR, gives a detailed explanation of past and current trends in funding of agricultural research and analyzes various agricultural research funding mechanisms that have been used in the past and should be explored today in order to increase agricultural research outputs in developing countries.vBecause underfunding threatens the survival of agricultural research systems in many developing countries, policymakers and development assistance agencies must find alternative institutional mechanisms for sustained financing. Some such alternative mechanisms include: joint public-private sector ventures, sale of research products, competitive funds, research foundations, farmer managed levies on production, and greater involvement of universities and private sector research. While exploring the potential of these alternative funding mechanisms is very important, another part of the solution is to create better managed and more flexible public sector systems, as the public sector is the greatest source of funding for agricultural research in developing countries. While government financing made up 81% of total funding for agricultural research in developing countries, the growth rate of public spending on agricultural research across the globe (developing and high income countries) has decreased in the past two decades.</p>
