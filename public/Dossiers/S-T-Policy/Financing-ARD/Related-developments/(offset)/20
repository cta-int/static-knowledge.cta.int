						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>
The World Bank's Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) released the report <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTGPAA/Resources/Agribusiness_eval.pdf" target="_blank">“Growth and Productivity in Agriculture and Agribusiness: Evaluative Lessons from World Bank Group Experience”</a> in October 2010. Drawing on the World Bank Group’s (WBG) experience in supporting agricultural growth over the past decade, the report points to areas where increased funding can translate into higher impact. The evaluation shows that agricultural projects have performed above the WBG average in Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe and Central Asia, and East Asia. Productivity growth has been particularly strong over a sustained period in China and India. Results in Sub-Saharan Africa, however, have been weak. Lessons of experience in such areas as water use and irrigation, rural infrastructure, know-how on supply-value chains, and gender mainstreaming are vital to agricultural growth. Some of the country cases indicate how the expansion of rural infrastructure in China, India, and Mali yielded better outcomes in agriculture. However, in most cases sustainability of these programs beyond the life of the project remains an issue because of insufficient government funding and limited cost-recovery. Monitoring and evaluation also remains weak, and inadequate reporting on outcomes and results constrains assessment of project effectiveness and inhibits institutional learning. This evaluation seeks to provide lessons from successes and failures in the Bank’s activities in the sector to help improve the development impact of the renewed attention to agricultural funding.(Source: World Bank, 18 October 2010)</p>

The first phase of the Nelson Mandela African Institute for Science and Technology (NM-AIST) in Arusha, Tanzania will be completed mid 2011. The institution's vice chancellor Prof. Burton Mwamila indicated that students’ admission would start in late 2011. He pointed out that the college would only enrol students who will pursue post-graduate degrees (doctorate and masters) in various scientific and engineering disciplines. Students would be enrolled from 18 African countries which have shown interest in the project. Nearly half a dozen other colleges/campuses are being set up in other parts of the continent under the Nelson Mandela Foundation. The Arusha campus is devoted to science and technology.(Source: The Citizen, Tanzania; 27 December 2010)</p>

					<p>
According to the recently released country note from ASTI and the Ethiopian Institute for Agricultural Research (EIAR), agricultural research and development (ARD) investment and human resource capacity have both grown significantly since the early 1990s in Ethiopia. Agricultural research spending doubled between 1993 and 2000, and then doubled again during 2000–01. The increased expenditures were driven by considerable growth in both government and donor funding, and in particular the World Bank–loan financed Agricultural Research and Training Project (ARTP). By 2008 investments had contracted to levels similar to those recorded in 2000. Funding remains highly dependent on donors and development bank loans. Delays in the disbursement of funds also present a significant challenge to the effective management of research expenditures. The Regional Agricultural Research Institutes (RARIs) and many of the higher education agencies have expanded significantly since 2000, strengthening their role in Ethiopian agricultural R&amp;D.(Source : ASTI News, 8 December 2010.)</p>

					<p>
The Mozambican government plans to rise funding for the agriculture sector by 2015, from 5.6 to 10 %. The rise in spending in this sector is part of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme - CAADP, the Mozambican version of which was launched Monday in Maputo (Mozambique). One of the commitments of the CAADP is related to consigning at least 10 percent of the state budget to agriculture, in order to secure reasonable funds for the sector. The CAADP aims to induce and sustain transformation of agriculture at an annual average rate of 6 percent, as a way of improving food security and reducing poverty. CAADP was established as part of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) by the summit of African Union heads of state and Mozambican government. The inauguration of the programme is a major milestone in a process that includes drawing up a national strategy for agricultural development for the next ten years, involving all stakeholders, which the government intends to have ready by April 2011. This strategy will be aligned to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and to the four pillars of CAADP. These are expanding the area under sustainable land management and irrigation; improving marketing infrastructures and capacities; ensuring greater availability of foodstuffs and thus reducing hunger; and agricultural research, and the adoption and dissemination of technologies.(Source: CAADP, 17 December 2010.)</p>

The Asian Development Bank (ADB), along with its research partners (IRRI and IFPRI) and developing member countries are to explore new ways of strengthening food security and improving nutrition in Asia-Pacific region. The ADB Board of Directors approved in mid-November 2010 a regional technical assistance grant of US$4 million for the Strategic Research for Sustainable Food and Nutrition Security in Asia. It will examine how countries can tackle rice yield gaps, water use problems, fragmented food supply chains and underinvestment in agricultural research. ADB will work with the IRRI and the IFPRI, as well as participating countries, to find ways of overcoming the constraints. This will include exploring ecologically-sound methods for reducing rice pest outbreaks and pre- and post-harvest rice losses, which account for up to a quarter of the current yield gap. ADB is the executing agency for the project, which is due for completion in December 2012.(Source: ADB, 17 November 2010.)</p>

	Key CGIAR donors’ and stakeholders’ meeting in Washington, D.C. early November 2010, took a decisive step toward harmonizing funding for agricultural research for development. They agreed to channel their collective support into major strategic research initiatives that will decisively confront hunger and poverty in developing countries, while cushioning climate change impacts and curbing natural resource destruction. The new agreement establishes a multi-donor trust fund (the CGIAR Fund), connecting donors with the Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers. Approval came after deliberations by the CGIAR Fund’s decision making body, the Fund Council, on 1-2 November 2010. Fund donors also confirmed new leadership and members of the CGIAR’s Independent Science and Partnership Council. CGIAR Fund donors further agreed to support two new strategic research programs – one dealing with rice-based farming systems and the other with climate change, agriculture and food security.

	According to the recent country note published by ASTI and the National Livestock and Veterinary Research Center (CNERV, Mauritania), in 2008, fisheries research dominates Mauritania’s agricultural research system. The Institute of Oceanographic Research and Fisheries (IMROP) is the principal agricultural R&amp;D agency, accounting for close to half of all agricultural R&amp;D expenditures and capacity. This situation sharply contrasts that of the National Agricultural Research and Development Center (CNRADA) and of the CNERV, the country’s main agencies for crop and livestock research. Both centers have seen their R&amp;D budgets shrink since 2000. (Source: ASTI News, 27 October 2010).</p>

	According to the latest country note by ASTI and the National Center for Agricultural Research (CNRA, Abidjan, Ivory Coast), agricultural research and development (R&amp;D) expenditures in Côte d’Ivoire fell around the turn of the millennium due to the sociopolitical turmoil that rocked the country. However, spending remained relatively stable during 2002-2008, despite the civil war and the withdrawal of World Bank support. While the government was unable to keep its funding commitment to CNRA, the country’s main agricultural R&amp;D agency, in full, the private sector stepped up funding of agricultural research, through the Inter-Professional Fund for Agricultural Research and Extension (FIRCA). Internally generated resources accounted for the remainder of CNRA’s funding. FIRCA is a funding system that is unique and exemplary in Africa. Through FIRCA, research has become more demand driven and the system’s solidarity mechanism ensures the availability of research funds to assist those agricultural production sectors in which the volume of raised subscription fees is low. In addition, Côte d’Ivoire is one of the few countries in the subregion that does not depend heavily on large-scale donor funding to pursue its agricultural research. This means that in setting its research priorities, it is less subjected to external pressures than are numerous other countries in West Africa. (Source: ASTI News, 18 October 2010).</p>

	According to the recently released country note by ASTI, the Farm and Infrastructure Foundation (FIF), and the Agricultural Research Council of Nigeria (ARCN), Nigeria now have the largest agricultural research and development (R&amp;D) system of all countries in Sub-Saharan Africa in terms of investments and numbers of researchers. Furthermore, the recent establishment of ARCN as a coordinating body for agricultural research in the country should have a constructive influence on research by strengthening collaboration, lessening duplication, and hopefully encouraging even greater support, in particular from non-governmental sectors like the private sector. One capacity trend (stemming from a long-term recruitment freeze) is the shift away from senior, well-qualified researchers toward more junior researchers qualified to the BSc level only. In addition, structural challenges caused by the many years of underinvestment remain. Consequently, it is noted, addressing infrastructure and training needs will be critical in the years to come. Nigeria’s public agricultural research capacity also increased between 2000 and 2008, resulting in growth in researcher numbers, in full-time equivalents, from about 1,300 to more than 2,000.

					<p>Aflasafe® is a win-win formula for African farmers and investors that uses otherwise harmless fungi to control those that produce deadly aflatoxins in maize and peanut. The biological control of aflatoxins using aflasafe has rekindled hopes of a brighter future for African farmers battling crop contamination even as it opened doors for the private sector looking to invest in a winning formula in the continent's agriculture sector. The aflasafe technology, which uses “good” fungus to fight the “bad” ones, has provided relief to hundreds of maize farmers in northern Nigeria, a region where more than 70% of the population depend on agriculture for at least part of their livelihood. According to Ranajit Bandyopadhyay, IITA (Ibadan, Nigeria) plant pathologist, and Irmgard Hoeschle-Zeledon, coordinator of the CGIAR's Systemwide Program on Integrated Pest Management, an initial investment of US$1-3 million in an aflasafe manufacturing plant is likely to reap investors about N20 million ($1.33 million) annually. Bandyopadhyay indicated that an investment in an aflasafe manufacturing plant in Nigeria would pay off considering the huge demand for quality maize in the country and its neighbours.

	Several countries in Africa such as Togo, Sierra Leone and Rwanda are now receiving funds for agricultural development from the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP). A $22 billion pledge made by the G8 and commitment from African governments will enable African countries to achieve food security and higher economic growth. CAADP will guide governments on sustainable land and water management; building trade and marketing infrastructure; increasing food and nutrition security; and promoting research in agriculture, extension and training for adoption and dissemination of new technologies. FANRPAN, a network of researchers, farmers and governments covering 14 Southern African countries, is coordinating the program at the national and regional levels in the sub-region.

					<p>Three East African universities will benefit from a 2.5 billion Ugandan Shillings boost for agriculture research. The money, which has been earmarked by the European Union (EU), will benefit Uganda Martyrs University Nkozi, Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology, and Kenyatta University. According to Dr Charles Ssekyewa, the coordinator of the project, the money will be channelled through the EU’s African, Caribbean and Pacific Science and Technology Transfer Programme. He said three-year agricultural research projects in the universities would focus on improving existing food crops so that they adapt to climate change and register higher yields.

					<p>The government of Sudan contributed 100 million US dollars to Mahaseel Agricultural Investment Fund, a private equity fund between Kenana Sugar Company and Beltone Private Equity, with the aim of deploying up to US$ 1 billion in large-scale agriculture projects in Sudan and Egypt. The Managing Director of Beltone Investment, Mr. Hazem Barakat, said that Beltone would provide investment management, corporate finance and strategy capabilities for the fund, which will focus on investments in agriculture; the production and processing of crops and livestock in Sudan, as well as opportunities in food processing and agro-related businesses in Egypt.

					<p>Malawi and UNDP have signed a formulation phase project document for managing climate change in the country to be implemented to a tune of $4.2 million. The project will be co-financed by Norway, Spain and DFID. The formulation phase project is aimed at enhancing coordination between government and its developing partners in developing a national framework for responding to challenges climate change poses to Malawi’s economic development and food security.

					<p>Developing countries will have to double or even triple their own investments in agricultural research to meet food needs, says a major new report. Poor countries should be spending at least 1.5 per cent of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on agricultural research rather than waiting for donors to fulfil promises, according to Transforming Agricultural Research for Development, a <a href="http://www.egfar.org/egfar/website/new/newspage?contentId=3002" target="_blank">report</a> that has taken two years to produce.

					<p>The Scottish Government's International Development fund has provided an award of nearly £400,000 to farmers in Malawi to improve their potato crops and to benefit from the expertise of researchers from the Scottish Crops Research Institute (SCRI). The Institute in collaboration with the International Potato Center and national potato researchers will work with farmers to combat constraints and improve potato crop yields that would eventually reduce poverty and increase food security in Malawi.
