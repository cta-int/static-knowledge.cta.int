						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Countries under the Association for Strengthening Agricultural Research in Eastern and Central Africa (ASARECA), should establish a new generation of innovation-oriented agricultural universities to help integrate research, training and extension services. This was one of the key recommendations at the close of the first General Assembly of the Association for Strengthening Agricultural Research in Eastern and Central Africa (ASARECA), held in Entebbe, Uganda from 14–16 December, 2011. The General Assembly agreed to foster partnerships within individual countries and across the region, including closer collaboration between research, training and extension service providers, and more private sector engagement in commercialising research outputs. According to the recommendations, the new universities should be anchored in ministries of agriculture and linked with other ministries such as education, environment, water and transport. It is perceived that this could eradicate the disconnection between National Agricultural Research Institutes (NARIs) and training in various faculties of agriculture at existing universities.

The declaration describes the vision of Open Science in the 21st century and lists the requirements that need to be fulfilled to realise this vision:


 Open Scientific Content arising from publicly funded research





 Open e-Infrastructures for public and private research





 Towards an Open Science Culture


It describes under the title ‘Making it happen’ how ALLEA and its member academies will advocate the adoption of Open Access and Open Science.(Via <a href="http://aims.fao.org/news/european-academies-declare-open-science-21st-century" target="_self">AIMS</a>, 04/2012)</p>

					<p>The Atlantic reports on the initiative taken by two of the most venerable US universities to provide courses online, free of charge. MIT and Harvard have ‘[poured] US$ 30 million into a non-profit partnership <a href="http://www.edxonline.org/" target="_blank">edX</a>, which they hope will make the top-notch faculties and courses of their schools available for free to millions of people around the world’. Through edX, the two institutions will collaborate to enhance campus-based teaching and learning and build a global community of online learners. The technological platform established by MITx, which will serve as the foundation for the new learning system, was designed to offer online versions of MIT courses featuring video lesson segments, embedded quizzes, immediate feedback, student-ranked questions and answers, online laboratories, and student paced learning. Certificates of mastery (though not issued under the name Harvard or MIT) will be available for those motivated and able to demonstrate their knowledge of the course material.(<a href="http://www.edxonline.org/release.html%20" target="_blank">edX</a> via <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/05/the-single-biggest-change-in-education-since-the-printing-press/256655/" target="_blank">The Atlantic</a>, 2/5/2012)</p>

					<p>This World Bank Discussion Paper explores the relationship between education spending and outcomes. The topic is already addressed by a fairly rich body of research at the primary and secondary level, but it has been poorly documented at the tertiary level of education, despite ever rising expenditures. This paper explores the impact of various measures of spending on a range of outcomes of tertiary education, using cross-country comparisons in the South Asia Region (SAR). It finds that public expenditures are only loosely linked with outcomes in terms of access and participation, but that they are positively associated with proxies of quality. Private expenditures appear to have no impact on either quantity or quality. This exploratory research shows very different patterns for the group of high-income countries and less developed countries.

	Seven West African universities have created a masters degree in tropical biotechnologies. The universities are Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar in Senegal; Abobo-Adjamey of Abidjan in Côte d'Ivoire; Abomey-Calavi of Cotonou in Benin; Abdou Moumouni of Niamey in Niger; Bamako in Mali; Nouakchott in Mauritania; and Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso. The countries are all members of the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS. The programme is to address the limited capacity of present human resources in this branch of agricultural research. The course will be given online to ensure quality and to make it accessible to all students in the region. From 2012 on, the masters will offer two specialisations, in plant biotechnology and in agricultural and environmental biotechnology.

	The Minister of Higher education and University, Léonard Mashako Mamba laid the first stone at the University of Kinshasa, DRC (UNIKIN) for the construction of an agricultural research center, financed by Korean project KOPIA/DRC.This center has to reinforce the research that contributes to the modernisation and promotion of agriculture in DRC. Once built the research centre will provide farmers with seeds and machinery, to help them improve the quality and quantity of their products. The action also aims at the promotion of scientific research at UNIKIN.The Korean Rural Development Administration set up KOPIA (Korea Project on International Agriculture) centres in countries including Vietnam, Kenya, DRC, Brazil, Uzbekistan and Myanmar to spread Korea's customized agricultural technology. For example, the KOPIA centre in Kenya built and operates vinyl greenhouses, poultry farms and distributed agricultural machines such as bicycle-turned thrashers and rice planting machines in order to help the region's farming activities.(Source: digitalcongo.net, 14 Mar. 2011)</p>

	he Director-General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, signed an agreement with Soumaïla Cissé, President of the Commission of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA), to launch a US$12 million project to boost the information and communication technology (ICT) capacity of West African universities.The project is part of a wide-ranging cooperation plan initiated in 2006 by UNESCO and the UEMOA. It aims to develop the use of ICTs to support an ongoing reform of higher education in the UEMOA member states (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Guinea Bissau, Niger, Mali, Senegal and Togo). The three-year project will install ICT infrastructure, both material and virtual, in higher education institutions. The campuses of eight universities, one in each UEMOA country, will be equipped with fibre optic equipment and at least 200 computers with high-speed connection. In addition to a regional virtual library network to which universities will be linked, the project will set up a cyber institute giving professors on-line access to training courses. A central data base for calculating students’ course credits in all state universities will be established, to help harmonize academic standards and facilitate student mobility.The project will be implemented by UNESCO’s cluster office in Bamako (Mali).(Source: UNESCO, 14feb2011)</p>

	African academies are still battling to obtain funding and recognition from policymakers despite several efforts to strengthen them. This message came out of the sixth meeting of the African Science Academy Development Initiative (ASADI) taking place in Somerset West near Cape Town, South Africa, 7–11 November 2010. Support programmes like ASADI, which started in 2004, have resulted in a proliferation of academies on the continent and a renewed focus on their role in advising policymakers. But as these programmes mature, academies are expected to raise their own funding. Academies are now looking to secure stable and long-term funding for their operation beyond the first initiative.(Source: Scidev.net, 9 November 2010).</p>

	Lessons from a Ten-Year Funder Collaborative: A case study of the Partnership for Higher Education in Africa (PHEA) is a newly-published case study which tracks the successes and shortcomings of the Partnership, which began in 2000 and whose members invested US$440 million in 65 universities across nine African countries. PHEA represented some of the largest United States foundations, such as the Carnegie Corporation, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Ford Foundation. Participating countries included Egypt, Ghana, Madagascar, Mozambique, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda. The study reveals successes and hard lessons from an initiative to strengthen higher education on the continent. It is based on discussions with 30 participants, including four founding presidents, and a review of key documents, reports and evaluations. The case study is the second in a series of three publications documenting the PHEA. It is aimed at assisting all grant-making foundations, especially those that have been involved in or may consider collaborative funding in the future. Among outcomes listed as successes are an increased investment in and awareness of higher education in Africa - the partnership helped spur multi-million dollar pledges by international donors such as the World Ban - and increased investment by participant foundations. Among the partnership's weaknesses, the study notes the following: a lack of clarity about PHEA's mission; an initial absence of a strong coordinating body and cumbersome decision-making; fluctuations in interest from presidents and changes in foundation leadership; and the absence of an exit plan to prepare for the demise of the partnership.

	The US Agency for International Development (USAID) and Higher Education for Development (HED, Washington DC, USA) are building strategic capacity-building partnerships between 22 universities in Africa and the US. With the backing of up to $US 1.1 million each, detailed five-year strategic plans and comprehensive 10-year visions, the goal is to assist the realisation of Sub-Saharan initiatives for national and regional development through higher educational investment. The institutions will tackle issues ranging from food security and health to natural resource and climate management, energy and education in Africa. Lead African institutions of the partnerships include: Addis Ababa University (Ethiopia), Catholic University of Sudan, International Institute for Water and Environmental Engineering (Burkina Faso), Kenyatta University (Kenya), Makerere University (Uganda), University of Cape Town (South Africa), Université Gaston-Berger (Senegal), University of Ghana, University of Liberia, University of Malawi, and the University of Nairobi (Kenya).

	The African Copyright &amp; Access to Knowledge (ACA2K) Project, which started in 2007, is probing the relationship between national copyright environments and access to learning materials in African countries. The project is exploring this relationship within an access to knowledge (A2K) framework - a framework which regards the protection/promotion of user access as one of the central objectives of copyright law. The project, supported by Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC, Ottawa) and South Africa's Shuttleworth Foundation (Durbanville, South Africa) and managed by the LINK Centre at the Wits University Graduate School of Public &amp; Development Management (P&amp;DM) in Johannesburg South Africa, currently has research nodes in eight African countries: Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Mozambique, Senegal, South Africa and Uganda. The general objective of the ACA2K project is to empower researchers in the study countries (nodes) to develop the evidence necessary for stakeholders in their countries to pursue development of copyright policy environments that maximise the opportunities for digital and hard-copy learning materials access.</p>

	The Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) has been selected to build a centre of excellence to oversee the training of soil scientists for the West African sub-region over the next five years. Twenty students from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, Niger and Nigeria will be offered scholarships to undertake a four-year PhD programme at the university under the aegis of the Alliance for Green Revolution Africa (AGRA). They are expected to contribute to the achievement of an envisaged six percent growth in Africa’s food production by 2015 under the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP).

	The Special Meeting of the Council for Trade and Economic Development (COTED) Agriculture held in St George’s, Grenada concluded on 22 october 2010 with the endorsement of the ‘Regional Food and Nutrition Security Policy and Action Plan’, a document meant to be a comprehensive and integrated plan to achieve the objectives of adequate, stable and nutritious supplies of food throughout the Caribbean Region. If implemented, the policy would secure higher food production; better health and nutrition; income and employment opportunities; and poverty alleviation. The COTED and the Council for Human and Social Development (COHSOD) have both approved the blueprint of the Regional Policy during the month of October 2010. The COHSOD acknowledged the critical link between education and food and nutrition security and agreed that a focal team from within the education sector would be nominated to support the implementation of the Regional Policy on Food and Nutrition Security.
