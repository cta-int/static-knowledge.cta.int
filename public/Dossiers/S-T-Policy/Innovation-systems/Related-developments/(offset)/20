						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Media attention to mislabelled seafood is helping bring the scale of illegal and unregulated fishing to consumers' attention. Bangor University and University of Salford scientists explain how genetic tools can promote sustainability and make sure the fish we buy is what it says on the label. The author also look at so-called IUU fishing (illegal, unreported and unregulated), which is not included in stock assessment and examine the consequence of unidentifiable marketed fish (that leads to fraud or mislabelling). The illegal substitution of one species for another is best tackled by a method known as 'COI barcoding', a process that works by analysing the 600 base-pair sequence of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase I gene. DNA results from fish samples can be matched against the Barcode of Life Data system (www.boldsystems.org) which currently contains the DNA sequences of nearly a third of known fish species. The method is cost-effective and reliable. Virtually any product advertised or sold as a particular species, anywhere in the world, can be verified unequivocally using a COI barcoding test.

					<p>The Kenya Horticultural Competitive Programme (KHCP) has partnered with Good Neighbours Initiative to come up with locally improvised greenhouse in Western Kenya region. The partnership heralds what could be a major paradigm shift from open pollinated farming to hybrid high-yielding technique for improved income generation, crop production and self reliance in food security. The Kenya Horticultural Competitive Programme field officer Henry Nyamato says controlled climate in the greenhouse (ranging from 21-29) for tropical crops records high yield and uniform maturity with over 90% yield assured.

					<p>In a search to find better ways to control viral enteric diseases in birds, US Department of Agriculture (USDA) scientists have unearthed a treasure trove of previously known and unknown viruses in poultry by using a powerful new molecular tool called metagenomics. Each year, disorders like poult enteritis mortality syndrome, poult enteritis complex, and runting-stunting syndrome cause diarrhoea in turkeys and chickens, resulting in decreased weight, mortality and increased production costs. Metagenomics detects the nucleic acid of thousands of organisms in an entire community. Using this technique, researchers at USDA Agricultural Research Service discovered a new virus that might have future antimicrobial applications.

					<p>A US company is recycling food waste into chicken and cattle feed, in an environmentally friendly way. It recycles about 1 000 tonnes of food waste per week, mainly baked goods, and turns it into nearly 800 tonnes of animal feed, using 'green' manufacturing process. The waste goes into a dehydrator, where a drum spins it under temperatures of about 800 degrees. It produces a sterile, dry powder loaded with proteins and carbohydrates. The dehydrator used to burn expensive natural gas but now only burns the main waste product, sawdust, produced by construction companies and furniture manufacturers. Fuel costs are now 20 times lower. (<a href="http://www.allaboutfeed.net/news/going-green-recycling-food-waste-into-livestock-feed-13293.html" target="_blank">AllAboutFeed</a>, 4/6/2012)</p>

					<p>In <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/sparing-or-sharing-protecting-wild-species-may-require-growing-more-food-on-less-land/" target="_blank">the study</a> 'Reconciling food production and biodiversity conservation: land sharing and land sparing compared', Dr Ben Phalan and research colleagues from the University of Cambridge and Royal Society for the Protection of Birds discovered that, under current and future scenarios of food demand, most species would have larger total populations if farming was restricted to the smallest area feasible, while protecting as much natural forest as possible. This was true not just for rare species but for common species as well. This strategy, called ‘land sparing’, uses higher yields on existing farmland to spare land for nature (in contrast with ‘land sharing’, which aims to conserve wild species and grow crops on the same land). Because high-yield farming produced more food from less land, it could be used as part of a strategy to protect larger tracts of natural habitats such as forest.

					<p>Rwanda has decided to venture into the creative world of fabrics, this time on a discovery mission of how to manufacture fabrics from banana fibre. Bananas are a staple food here in Rwanda being consumed by the greater part of the population. While we consume the fruit, cloth will be woven from tree fibres. Now imagine how the local textile industry is set for a major boom, after the announcement today of the seven-member technical team that is set for Japan, to start the process of transferring banana textile technology to Rwanda. This team is going to study this ancient tradition of transforming banana fibre into textiles which dates back to the 13th century, in Japan. (Source: New Vision, 16 January 2009)</p>

					<p>Resilience of landscapes is sometimes stretched to a tipping point and adverse changes then follow quickly. At the moment, little is known about the connection between environmental stresses and catastrophic shifts. <a href="http://www.cascade-project.eu/" target="_self">CASCADE</a> will investigate a range of dryland ecosystems in southern Europe to study a range of physical and socio-economical drivers and obtain a better understanding of sudden shifts in drylands that may lead to major losses in biodiversity and concomitant ecosystem services. By focusing on vulnerable drylands as the target ecosystems, it builds further on existing knowledge regarding shifts in these ecosystems. CASCADE will improve our understanding of the biogeochemical mechanisms underlying sudden and catastrophic shifts, and of the key biotic and abiotic factors influencing these processes. The CASCADE approach will develop a common-ground participatory approach that will serve as the basis of the sustainable management of the ecosystems, the biodiversity within these ecosystems, and the services provided by the ecosystems.(via <a href="http://www.wageningenuniversity.nl/UK/newsagenda/news/cascade_180612_.htm" target="_blank">Wageningen University</a>, 18/6/2012)</p>

					<p>Breadfruit (<i>Artocarpus altilis</i>) is a high-yielding underutilized food-crop that grows in abundance in many tropical nations that struggle with malnutrition, including Haiti, the Philippines and India. It's high in carbohydrates, very high-yielding and requires few agricultural inputs. Because breadfruit has such a short shelf-life, most breadfruit goes uneaten, even in extremely malnourished communities. Compatible Technology International (CTI) has developed a set of manually-operated tools that rural villagers can use to preserve fresh breadfruit as gluten-free flour. The tools include a shredder, dryer and grinder. Breadfruit flour can be used in cookies, cakes, and many other products as a substitute or in addition to wheat flour, which is much more costly. In the fall of 2012, the breadfruit equipment will be thoroughly tested at the <a href="http://ntbg.org/breadfruit/" target="_self">Breadfruit Institute of the National Tropical Botanical Garden</a> in Hawaii. CTI will use the data collected at the Breadfruit Institute and in Haiti (a project using the tool) to help community enterprises form economically viable business models.(Via agro.biodiver.se, 8/2012)</p>

Forestry departments of Fiji, Samoa and Solomon Islands and several industrial companies in the region are collaborating in the project, which is funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR).

					<p>For centuries farmers optimized their crops and livestock by breeding and selection, and retained the best plants or animals and shared the seed or lines with other farmers, who then further improved on them. This represents the conventional model of open-source licensing: where a party can use and develop a product, and then use that technology to profit as long as they do not block others improving upon that technology. In the 20th century the business model of seed supply drifted away from open source. The many legal changes that occurred in many countries gradually shifted emphasis onto private control of collections of genetic traits, or ‘germplasm’. As plant varieties became privatized and commoditised, corporations began to take more control of the innovation process. Economic and reputational incentives began to overshadow philosophical considerations of how publicly funded research translates into public good. Sharing of technologies was deemphasized.Read the rest of this in-depth analysis on the strengthening of the ‘Agricultural Open Source Infrastructure’ from <i>Science Progress</i> (20/8/2012).<a href="http://scienceprogress.org/2012/08/the-hard-path-to-open-source-bioinnovation/" target="_self">http://scienceprogress.org/2012/08/the-hard-path-to-open-source-bioinnovation/</a></p>

					<p>The ‘systems of innovation’ hypothesis is tested to determine if a dynamic and growth oriented agricultural sector is not possible without a functional system of innovation (SI). The researchers moved away from the national system of innovation to highlight the ways that the SI manifests itself using a selection of crops in Ghana and Burkina Faso (plantain, maize, millet, yam, sorghum) that have shown significant growth in production over the last two decades.&nbsp;Using two indicators (a common understanding on objectives and priorities, and a high level of interactivity), the authors find (i) little evidence of common understanding of the objectives or priorities of the SI and (ii) low levels of interactivity. They noted that where there is interaction, it is mainly passive/informal. They concluded that there is weak evidence of the existence of anything that might be considered a high functioning SI. Increases in yield could have been attributed to increased acreage more than to increases in productivity and not to the SI. They are of the view that the most satisfactory explanation linking growth and a functioning SI may only become evident when farmers have exhausted the possibilities of easy wins. From a policy perspective, they suggest that it may be more opportunistic to target investment in agricultural research and other activities that support innovation.&nbsp;(via&nbsp;<a href="http://www.future-agricultures.org/research/science-technology-and-innovation/7847-working-paper-does-rapid-agricultural-growth-require-a-system-of-innovation-evidence-from-ghana-a-burkina-faso?utm_source=K4DNewsletterEN&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_campaign=K4D_EN_May2013" target="_self">Future Agricultures Consortium</a>, 01/05/2013)</p>

					<p>Toni Darbas (CSIRO, Australia) and Jim Sumberg (IDS, UK) express their scepticism about the recent ‘value chains’ narrative in agricultural development discourse &nbsp;that sees agriculture as a ‘business’ that must be ‘professionalised’. The authors believe that there are good reasons to be sceptical about their ability to deliver on &nbsp;the high expectations that are being laid at their door. Some of the reasons for scepticism they list are: unknown feedback across administrative scales; unknown &nbsp;evolution of transaction costs; private sector interests vs. public ones; inclusion issues; innovation blueprints insensitive to context; little direct evidence of positive &nbsp;impact of innovation platforms and value chains to poor farmers.&nbsp; They believe there is the constant danger of slipping into uncritical, formulaic and context insensitive &nbsp;responses. A much more critical and realistic approach to the potential contribution and applicability of both value chain approaches and innovation platforms would &nbsp;likely pay large dividends, they conclude. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.future-agricultures.org/blog/entry/can-value-chains-and-innovation-platforms-boost-african-agriculture-11-reasons-to-be-sceptical" target="_self">http://www.future-agricultures.org/blog/entry/can-value-chains-and-innovation-platforms-boost-african-agriculture-11-reasons-to-be-sceptical</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(Future Agricultures, 07/08/2013)&nbsp;</p>

Synergies between the two sectors have been recommended both in terms of transnational funding mechanisms and &nbsp;coordination of capacity and research communities. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/specialreports/index.php?action=view&amp;report=35" target="_self">http://www.universityworldnews.com/specialreports/index.php?action=view&amp;report=35</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.oecd.org/sti/iherd-marseille-expert-meeting.htm" target="_self">http://www.oecd.org/sti/iherd-marseille-expert-meeting.htm</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(University World News, 19/08/2013)</p>

					<p>The objective of this research fair organised in June 2013 by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and the Swiss Commission for Research Partnerships with Developing &nbsp;Countries (KFPE) was to enable exchange and dialogue between science, policy, and practice for securing global public goods in the context of sustainable development. From this page, &nbsp;you can download presentations by key staff of participating organisations on topics such as ‘Getting research and innovation into policy and practice’.In his presentation, François Münger, Head of the Global Programme on Water Initiatives at SDC, details the barriers to linking research, policy and practice, such as: Low recognition and &nbsp;rating of practice and policy influence in a academic cursus; Difference of timing between research and political rhythms which limits the possibility to take advantage of the political &nbsp;opportunities; Results often presented to potential users at the end of research project. According to him, transdisciplinary and multi-stakeholder approaches can further innovation by &nbsp;connecting researchers to larger networks or introduce them to transdisciplinary approaches that can help them think out of the box. Research partnership is an important strategic option to &nbsp;connect policy and research.(KFPE, 06/2013)</p>

					<p>Biodegradable agricultural waste blends developed by Greg Holt, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), USA and colleagues at the USDA’s Cotton Production and Processing Research Unit in Texas, are being used by the packaging industry in a new process that 'grows' made-to-order packaging products to protect breakable goods during shipping. The proprietary process involves combining cotton gin waste and fungi inside a cast, resulting in a spongy-looking material similar in appearance to polystyrene foam. The custom-shaped end product provides a cost-effective 'green' alternative to extruded polystyrene foam packaging. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2013/131209.htm" target="_self">http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2013/131209.htm</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(USDA ARS, 09/12/2013) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>This monograph on the System of Crop Intensification (SCI), published by the SRI International Network and Resources Center (SRI-Rice), Cornell University, USA, is a compilation of extraordinary reports from the field written by the Centre's Norman Uphoff and Erika Striger and their research partners from South Asia and East Africa. SCI, an ensemble of agro-ecological innovations generalised from the precursor System of Rice Intensification (SRI), aims to achieve higher output with less use of or less expenditure on land, labour, capital, and water – all by making modifications in crop management practices. The contributors to this monograph are reporting as initiators or supporters of the changes being introduced, not as researchers studying them, although all have done and continue to do publishable research. By communicating observed outcomes achieved under real-world circumstances as accurately as possible, this information could stimulate the interest of others to undertake more systematic studies and to help establish scientific explanations for promoting the greater utilisation of SCI adaptations. The focal crops of the systems of agricultural intensification described in this monograph include wheat, tef, maize, finger millet, sugarcane, legumes and vegetables. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/aboutsri/othercrops/SCImonograph_SRIRice2014.pdf" target="_self">http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/aboutsri/othercrops/SCImonograph_SRIRice2014.pdf</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(SRI-Rice, 01/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>The Trust for Advancement of Agricultural Sciences (TAAS), the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and the Asia-Pacific Association of Agricultural Research Institutions (APAARI), organised a <i>National Workshop on Outscaling Farm Innovation</i> on 3-5 September 2013. Since India made considerable investment in technology systems and farmers’ development programmes, farmers have taken lead in inventing new methods of sharing within farming communities. The workshop served as a platform to share, improve and out-scale these farming innovations. The themes covered were crop practices, natural resource management, mechanization and post-harvest activities, livestock, cultivation of high value commodities, diversification, energy, institutional requirements, policy issues, etc. This publication summarises the discussions and the recommendations that emerged from the event. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apaari.org/publications/outscaling-farm-innovation-2013.html" target="_self">http://www.apaari.org/publications/outscaling-farm-innovation-2013.html</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(APAARI, 2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
