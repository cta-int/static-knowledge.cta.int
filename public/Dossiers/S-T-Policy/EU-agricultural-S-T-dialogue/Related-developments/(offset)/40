						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>The SENSE project (Harmonised Environmental Sustainability in the European food and drink chain) brings together researchers, producers, transformers and distributors in order to achieve a harmonised, integral methodology that can be used to evaluate the environmental impact of food products accurately and efficiently. The project SENSE (7th FP) aims to contribute towards getting the food and drink sector to engage in more environmentally sustainable production, transformation and distribution of its products. The current situation presses the need to have tools that will help to reduce the environmental impact of food and drink throughout their production chain, starting with their production and transformation and going right up to their commercial distribution. The SENSE members will be focusing specifically on creating a methodology applied to the juice, dairy, meat and aquaculture sectors, chosen for their importance in the European market.

					<p>Late February 2012, the European Commission unveiled its plans for two new European Innovation Partnerships (EIPs) that will go some way to meeting the environmental and social issues facing Europe in the near future. The EIP that focuses on agriculture will deal with the increasing challenges food security poses for Europe, where, in this century, there will be a sharp rise in demand for feed, fibre, biomass, and biomaterials. This demand will come at the same time as a slow-down in production, due to cuts in agricultural research and the effects our actions have had on the environment and natural resources. This new partnership will seek to encourage innovations for sustainable food security.

					<p>The project is entitled PROMISE (‘PROtection of consumers by MIcrobial risk mitigation through SEgregation of expertise’) and will be undertaken by twenty partners from various European countries. The project team comprises representatives of twelve academic institutions and six national authorities for food safety and is headed by the Institute of Milk Hygiene at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria. The PROMISE project has the following goals: 1) make a survey of germs brought in together with food and investigate the potential of bacteria for causing disease; 2) pool data from throughout Europe to enable an accurate assessment of the risks posed by contaminated food of animal origin; 3) build up an extensive database of bacterial isolates identified in the course of the work. The results could help developing countries align their own food safety regulations with standards developed in export markets.

Organised by Sigma Orionis (the Project Coordinator), this very first official meeting gathered together the whole consortium members (a total of 11 partners): Sigma Orionis (France), CERT (Tunisia), CSIR/Meraka (South Africa), ESMT (Senegal), Fraunhofer (Germany), IICD (The Netherlands), KICTB (Kenya), KTH (Sweden), MCIT (Egypt), UMIC (Portugal) and VTT (Finland). Running for 24 months (2012-2013), the project objectives are twofold: (1) Enhance EU-African collaborative research on ICT; and (2) Support the ‘Africa-EU Strategic Partnership on Science, Information Society and Space’ (called ‘Partnership 8’ or P8).</p>

					<p>EU policies are continuing to seriously undermine rights in developing countries says a new report by CONCORD, the confederation of European development NGOs. The report shows incoherencies between EU development objectives and other policies, coming at an important time as the EU reforms its agricultural, trade and development policies. In the 2011 report, throughout the thematic chapters of relating to food security, natural resources management, human security, and migration, CONCORD uncovers some incoherencies of current EU policies and proposes fairer measures. The report finds that (a) the EU is failing to meet its obligations under the Lisbon Treaty to make its policies coherent so that they do not undermine development objectives; (b) the EU can greatly improve the impact of its €53 billion per year in development aid if it shows a clearer commitment to Policy Coherence for Development.

					<p>Aquaculture is the fastest-developing branch of the global food industry, with annual growth of 9 %. This rapid rise is pushing up demand for fish feed and the supply of fishmeal and fish oil – important ingredients in feed – is dwindling. They are set to be replaced by crops such as soya, maize and rape, but feed pellets made from them might contain pesticides. Scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME) in Schmallenberg, Germany have developed a system to test whether chemical substances accumulate in fish that are fed contaminated feed. In autumn 2011, the European Commission will publish new data requirements for fish as part of the approval process for pesticides. These will oblige every producer and importer who intends to bring a new pesticide onto the European market not only to register it but also to provide information proving it cannot accumulate in the edible parts of fish. The fish test developed at the IME will supply the information required.

	In 2010, UNESCO´s Regional Bureau for Science in Latin America and the Caribbean, based in Montevideo (Uruguay), developed a pilot methodology for the standardization and systematization of data on science, technology and innovation (STI) policies in the 33 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, together with a sophisticated information platform known as the Science Policy Information Network (SPIN). This platform is a cluster of databases equipped with powerful graphic and analytical tools that has been devised for political leaders, planners, directors and administrators of science and technology in parliaments, universities, research institutions, production enterprises concerned with innovation, international organisations; and researchers and other specialists whose field of study embraces science and technology policies. UNESCO has plans to turn SPIN into a global observatory, starting with Africa, the Arab States, Asia and the Pacific. In parallel, UNESCO is preparing a proposal to standardize and normalize the way in which the surveys and information about operational STI policy instruments are produced around the world. This work will culminate in the Paris Manual. A group of well-known international experts and STI decision-makers are meeting in Paris on 19-20 October 2011 at UNESCO’s invitation to take this process forward.

	The EC's EuropeAid Cooperation Office announced (on 11/5/2011) the signature of a €14.75M contract for support to a sub-Saharan African intra-regional research networking infrastructure which is already interconnected to the pan-European research network, GÉANT. The contract represents a significant injection of capital to develop research networking infrastructure across sub-Saharan Africa and with Europe. The AfricaConnect project will establish a high-capacity Internet network for research and education in Southern and Eastern Africa to provide the region with a gateway to global research collaboration, the objective of which is to overcome the current limitations of international research collaboration within sub-Saharan Africa and towards Europe, and to foster research and education collaboration and advancement within and between these regions. The project will be strongly collaborative, so whilst DANTE, the international research network operator that got the contract, will coordinate AfricaConnect, they will be partnered by DANTE's regional counterpart organisations in Africa – UbuntuNet Alliance covering Eastern and Southern Africa, and WACREN covering Western and Central Africa – as well as the Association of African Universities; existing National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) in Africa (DRC, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia); and several European NRENs (Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK). In April 2010, Knowledge for development mentioned the publication of the final report on the Feasibility Study on the AfricaConnect Initiative (<a href="http://knowledge.cta.int/en/content/view/full/11449" target="_blank">FEAST project</a>).</p>

	The UK's major public funders of national and international food-related research have published their co-ordinated plan for research to help the world avoid a potential food security crisis. In order to avoid this effectively, Research Councils, Government Departments and other public bodies are co-ordinating their research activities related to food and agriculture through the Global Food Security programme. <a href="http://www.foodsecurity.ac.uk/assets/pdfs/gfs-strategic-plan.pdf" target="_blank">The 2011 – 2016 strategic plan</a> has been published, and it outlines how the partners intend to work together across four cross-disciplinary research themes for food security: economic resilience, resource efficiency, sustainable food production and supply and sustainable, healthy, safe diets. The scope of the programme includes: food production and resource management; food economics, markets and trade; food processing, manufacture and distribution systems; food safety and nutrition; consumption habits and practices; and waste in the food system.(Source: DFID, 10 Feb. 2011)</p>

	The European Commission has adopted measures to make participation in the EU's current Seventh Framework Programme for Research more attractive and more accessible to the best researchers and most innovative companies, especially Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs). Based on the simplification plan in January 2011, The Commission adopted three concrete measures with immediate effect on the management of EU research grants in the current EU research programme (FP7). These are: 


Allowing more flexibility with respect to how personnel costs are calculated so that EU research grant-holders can apply their usual accounting methods when requesting reimbursement for average personnel costs. They will no longer need to set up entire parallel accounting systems just for this purpose;

SME owners whose salaries are not formally registered in their accounts can now be reimbursed, through flat-rate payments, for their contribution to work on research projects.

A new steering group of senior officials from all the Commission departments and agencies involved will remove inconsistencies in the application of the rules on research funding. 


The Commission considers simplification as one of the basic design principles for the next EU research and innovation programme (&quot;FP8&quot;), and will present its legislative proposals for the next EU research and innovation programme by the end of this year, following an open consultation to be launched in the early spring. More information about the consultation (Green Paper) is to be found <a href="/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Selected-events/Consultation-Green-Paper-on-a-Common-Strategic-Framework-for-future-EU-Research-and-Innovation-Funding" target="_blank">here</a> and more on the EC's plans to revamp its research funding process <a href="/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/EU-fostering-innovation-and-increasing-R-D-investment" target="_blank">here</a>.(Source: EC Press release, 24 Jan. 2011).</p>

	Innovation, Sustainability, Development: A New Manifesto</i> recommends new ways of linking science and innovation to development for a more sustainable, equitable and resilient future.It was produced by the 'Social, Technological and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability' Centre (STEPS), an interdisciplinary global research and policy engagement hub that unites development studies with science and technology studies. While acknowledging that future generations face huge social, environmental and economic challenges, and noting that global governance, economics and people work against the interest of poorer countries and people, the STEPS Centre proposes that science, technology and innovation must play essential roles in meeting the moral and political imperative of addressing the interlinked global challenges. The new manifesto recognizes the need for a new politics of innovation which responds to “which science?”, “what technologies? ‘and “what kinds of change?”. They call for greater respect cultural variety, regional diversity and democratic accountability and opening up of the political space and debate for more deliberation on styles and directions for research and innovation. They propose that radical changes be made to the way in which innovation is shaped through: agenda setting, funding, capacity building, organizational arrangements and monitoring, evaluation and accountability.</p>

	The EC wants to improve the quality labelling system it uses to designate traditional agricultural produce and foods. The system helps protect and promote the brand names of Europe’s traditional agricultural produce and foods. Since its creation in 1992, the system has registered products under one of three labels (Protected Designations of Origin; Protected Geographical Indications; Traditional Specialities Guaranteed). The Commission made legislative proposals in December 2010 called &quot;<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/quality/policy/quality-package-2010/index_en.htm" target="_blank">Quality package 2010</a>&quot; to streamline the system and make the labels easier to use and understand.The Quality Package puts in place a comprehensive policy on certification schemes, value-adding terms for agricultural product qualities, and product standards, covering the different facets of quality, from the compliance with minimum standards to the production of highly specific products. The Package comprises a new 'Agricultural Product Quality Schemes Regulation', a new general base-line ‘Marketing Standard’ for all agricultural products and new ‘Guidelines of best practices’ on voluntary certification schemes. For the future, the Commission announced its intention to study further the problems faced by small-scale producers in participating in Union quality schemes as well as mountain producers to market their products.For ACP farmers and food producers, national or regional quality standards could help them market their products abroad. The initiative by the EC could set a baseline for quality certification process and serve ACP countries in their effort to expand exports of agricultural produce of accredited quality. However, ACP countries would need to improve the human and physical infrastructure to take advantage of the opportunities.(Source: EC ARD website, 15 Feb. 2011)</p>

	The European Commission has given the green light to an ambitious research project called SUNRAY: the acronym for 'Sustainable Nutrition Research for Africa in the Years to come'. The project will be implemented by a consortium of four African and five European institutions coordinated by the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium. The SUNRAY-project intends to identify new and innovative ways to address the problem of malnutrition. The research agenda and priorities will be defined primarily by African researchers. Other institutions and individuals with an interest in nutrition and related fields in Africa will also be consulted. African partners will take ownership of the research agenda to ensure that it is sustainable. The research will be integrated with initiatives in other sectors such as agriculture, health, education, social protection and rural development, to address the root causes of malnutrition. The project will link research with policy and action, and involve a broad range of stakeholders, including politicians, government staff, health professionals, nutritionists, consumer and public health organisations, agro- and food industry, policy makers, non-governmental organisations, civil society, UN organisations and donors.(Source: Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp via <a href="http://www.alphagalileo.org/ViewItem.aspx?ItemId=94679&amp;CultureCode=en" target="_blank">AlphaGalileo.org</a>, 28 January 2011)</p>

	Plans have been unveiled to revamp EU research funding to spur more innovation, increase its economic impact, make it easier for researchers to get involved and deliver better value for taxpayers.The EU is spending about €143bn in the 2007-2013 period to fund research and innovation projects. Now the Commission is preparing the ground for the next round of funding - based on the priorities for <b><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/innovation_union/communication/iu_en.pdf" target="_blank">Innovation Union</a>,</b> part of the EU's <b><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eu2020/index_en.htm" target="_blank">Europe 2020</a></b> strategy to boost growth and jobs.<b> <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/csfri/pdf/com_2011_0048_csf_green_paper_en.pdf" target="_blank">Initial proposals</a></b> would refocus funding toward projects that tackle current challenges, such as health and an aging population, climate change, food security, and diminishing natural resources.Funding would also be better coordinated along the innovation chain - from basic research down to launching new products and services on the market. Simplified procedures and rules would make it easier for researchers, companies and entrepreneurs to cooperate, apply for and use EU funding. Performance checks would monitor projects to ensure taxpayers' money is being used effectively. The Commission has prepared a Green Paper and is seeking the views of all interested individuals and organisations on these proposed changes and on the specific questions set out in the Green Paper. The deadline for contributions is Friday 20 May 2011.<b>Increasing R&amp;D investment</b>The EU is also refocusing its funding to help close the innovation gap between the EU and its main competitors, the US and Japan. On most measures, the US is ahead of the EU, according to an <b><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/files/ius-2010_en.pdf" target="_blank">annual assessment</a></b>. Other emerging economies, such as China and Brazil, are rapidly narrowing that gap. EU leaders have given <b><a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/119175.pdf" target="_blank">broad support</a> </b>to the Commission's approach, which also involves creating public-private partnerships to bring more innovations to market faster. The first partnership, to be launched in 2011, will encourage R&amp;D to develop new products and services for active and healthy ageing.</p>

	A new biosafety facility was opened at the College of Natural and Applied Science, University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania under the Danish Bilateral Programme for Enhancement of Research Capacity in Developing Countries (ENRECA) of the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA). During the opening, Dr. Hassan Mshinda, Director General of the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology (Costech), said that the genetic techniques to be used in the facility would enhance both the qualitative and quantitative traits of the crops. On the other hand, Bjarne Sørensen, Danish ambassador to Tanzania, expressed his hope for the improvement of agriculture through modern biotechnology: ‘We expect the facility to give students, academic staff and relevant person’s knowledge on genetically modified plants through specialist training as well as generating local knowledge on the subject.’ (Source: ISAAA taken from The Citizen (Newspaper, Tanzania), 2 September 2010)</p>

					<p>The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the European Union have signed a 20 Euro million contribution agreement to support the COMESA agro inputs project known as (COMRAP). This will contribute to improving rural household food security and livelihoods in the COMESA region. More specifically, over the next two years, the project will improve smallholders' access to agro inputs and will improve the regional legal frameworks so as to increase agricultural productivity. The project will alleviate the constraints faced by smallholder farmers who want to access seeds, fertilizers and financing in order to increase the volume of their staple crop production.
