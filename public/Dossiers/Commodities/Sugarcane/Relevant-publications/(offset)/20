						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p> The Chinese sugar output is made up of cane sugar (86%) and beet sugar (14%). In recent years, the development of the sugar industry has encountered a major problem: sluggish domestic market and falling sugar prices. The downturn in the price of sugar has persisted since 1997, and the sugar price has fallen significantly below costs towards the end of 1999. The main reasons are sagging sugar price in the world market, excess domestic production capacity, and competition from saccharin as a low-cost substitute for sugar. On the other hand, a highly fragmented market and inefficient production structure are a fundamental cause of the high cost in sugar production. High production cost has made it difficult for domestic sugar processors to survive the competition from imports as well as from saccharin. After China joins the World Trade Organization (WTO), domestic sugar processing firms will have to face increasing competition from imports. Therefore, the government will need to implement an appropriate industrial policy to protect the domestic market and encourage industry restructuring. Policy measures to achieve these goals are proposed. From authors' summary. <i>In Sugar Journal (USA), v. 64 (8), p. 11-13, 16, 18</i> </p>

					<p> The advantages and disadvantages of manual harvesting and mechanical harvesting of sugar cane in Thailand are compared. Manual harvesting remains popular due to its low cost, low soil compaction, and low damage to cane roots and the subsequent ratoon crop. There are only 250 chopper harvesters in Thailand, mostly for use in relatively large cane fields. The existing harvesting equipment does not suit Thai farming practice as the required high field efficiency cannot be reached on most farms (maximum field lengths of 200 to 300 m). A small- to medium-sized harvesting machine would seem more suitable for Thai cane conditions, but farmers have not adopted the technology due to various problems. It is recommended that future research on small- and medium-sized harvesters should prioritize: appropriate power selection; de-trashing capacity; and, stalk transportation and handling.

					<p> Technical and marketing aspects of ethanol production in Brazil are described. Ethanol was the fuel selected for the first Ford Model T in 1908, but it was soon to be replaced with cheap petrol. Ethanol blends have been used in Brazil since 1923. From 1975 onward, the use of ethanol as fuel grew quickly as a result of the &quot;Proalcool&quot; programme, whose principal objective was to reduce oil imports. Sugar production has risen to 385 million t in 2004, which corresponds to 462 million oil barrels/year. Since the beginning of the programme, it has saved more than US$ 141 billion to the government. The Brazilian net of fuel distribution has more than 30 000 fuel stations to attend to 16 million cars running on petrol with 22-26% alcohol and more than 2 million cars running on pure ethanol. The automobile industry plans to launch the 3-fuel car (petrol, ethanol, and gas) in 2005. The industrial production of ethanol is based on large-scale fermentation of sugar cane juice, molasses, or a mix of both in fermentation vats of 0.4 to 2 million l. Batch fermentation is used in 75% of the cases. Special yeasts are used alone or mixed with baker's yeast. The success of the fermentation depends on molasses composition, acidity, purity, contamination with bacteria and wild yeasts, and good analytical methods. KIT(H1045)v. 67(12) p. 11-14</p>

					<p> In Angola, Congo, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), sugar cane has three main uses.  First, it is consumed as a ' <i>canne de bouche </i>' (literally, cane for the mouth), to quench one’s thirst, and/or to assuage one’s hunger. Consumers peel the cane with a knife, chew on the tender part, suck on it, swallow the juice and get rid of the bagasse (the fibrous portion of the sugar cane remaining after the juice has been extracted). Second, it is used as a raw material to produce sugar. Third, it is used in the preparation of sugar cane wine, called ' <i>lungwila</i>.' This article examines the knowledge process used to make sugar cane wine, a traditional product in the three countries mentioned. <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/afr/ik/iknt24.pdf" target="_blank">Download PDF</a> </p>

					<p> In this paper the authors revisit the Fiji sugar industry with a fresh mandate. The century old industry, widely perceived as the backbone of the Fijian economy, is on the verge of collapse. Recognising this, the Fiji government and the Asian Development Bank have developed a reform plan, envisaged to bailout the ailing sugar industry. The authors concur with the reform plan but demur with the claim that sugar production will not be affected. They use the Fiji computable general equilibrium model to simulate the economy-wide impact of a 30 percent reduction in sugar production. Amongst the key results it is found that Fiji’s gross domestic product will fall by around 1.8 percent and real welfare will decline by some 1.5 percent. Several policy implications from empirical results will be drawn. <a href="http://www.usp.ac.fj/fileadmin/files/schools/ssed/economics/working_papers/2004/wp2004_12.pdf" target="_blank">Download PDF</a> </p>

					<p> This study assesses the establishment of a new sugarcane estate in the Luena region of northern Zambia. Luena is a remote region for which new development alternatives are being considered by the Zambian government, while sugarcane offers a renewable resource that is quite suitable for the climate and the region. Although the establishment of a sugarcane estate has been considered in the region for many years, this study is the first to take a broad perspective based on the goals of sustainable development for the region. The study included two major components: (1) Techno-economic options; and (2) Social and Environmental Impacts. These components have been integrated using an interdisciplinary approach that recognizes the relevant linkages in a broad societal context and explores critical policy options that could promote sustainable development of the sugarcane resource. The market analysis addressed product strategies for raw sugar, ethanol, and surplus electricity, as well as flexible combinations of all three products. The results of the study include conclusions as to which strategies are viable and how they might be implemented in a way that promotes sustainable development. <a href="http://www.sei.se/energy/sugarcane/FullDocument.PDF" target="_blank">Download PDF</a> </p>

					<p> The Sugar Industry is a major contributor to the rural economic activity in the sugar cane growing areas of South Africa, namely, KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), Mpumalanga and the Eastern Cape generating an income from the sale of sugar and molasses of about R4 985 000 000 (R5 billion). The industry is composed of 15 sugar mills, 13 of which are scattered from the southern border of KZN to its northern border, and 2 of which are in Mpumalanaga. Most of the sugar cane supplied to these mills [85%] is produced by over 53 000 registered cane growers, the balance being supplied by the mill estates. This presentation will examine the factors that have influenced the successful development of commercial cane production and the policy environment as well as the institutional arrangements that enables such developments (excerpt taken from the original Executive summary). <a href="http://www.sarpn.org.za/EventPapers/Land/20010605Maloa.pdf" target="_blank">Download PDF</a> </p>

					<p> Mauritius has made constant efforts to improve and maintain the economic viability of this industry which has been the very lifeblood of its economy. As a small vulnerable economy which has to operate in a globalized environment, Mauritius needs a roadmap that will allow it to preserve its sugarcane sector and its multiple benefits and to transform the present threats into opportunities. Such a roadmap should address the following challenges: (i) preserve and consolidate the foreign exchange earnings from the sector to ensure a stable and predictable revenue for our food imports; (ii) preserve the livelihood of small planters and employees and their families who depend directly on the sugarcane sector; (iii) optimize value-added of sugar and its co-products; (iv) maintain social cohesion, which is the foundation of our much appreciated peaceful and stable democracy; (v) preserve and protect our environment- it is recognized that without the sugarcane plantations, which both bind the soil and act as carbon dioxide sink, our soils would degrade very fast, the lagoons would silt up and the air quality degrade, with adverse effects on tourism and fishing; (vi) optimize the production of environment friendly sources of energy, electricity from bagasse and ethanol from molasses; (vii) preserve the secondary employment created by those who indirectly service the industry, namely the SMEs have built on this foundation to create employment and tackle poverty; and (viii) ensure that the corporate sector is pro-active, with a leaner and more efficient organization which will allow it to meet the challenges of decreasing sugar prices. <a href="http://www.gov.mu/portal/goc/moa/files/roadmap.pdf" target="_blank">Download PDF</a> </p>

					<p> The reform proposals, if adopted would lead to the pauperization of the people and the creation of large pockets of poverty which will create-social and political instability and provide a breeding ground for criminals and extremists putting in peril their democracy and the rule of law. This isnot in the interest of the ACP and the EU. The socio-economic importance of thesugar cane industry to the ACP States cannot beminimised. Its multifunctional role, its contribution to the protection of the environment andin the development of eco-tourism and as aprovider of important services in the rural economies testify on the need to preserve the sugarlcane industry and maintain the plantations.The sugar cane also provides valuable by-products like bagasse for co-generation of environment friendly energy and molasses used for the production of bio-ethanol. Without the cane plantations, all these activities will not be possible. ACP sugar supplying countries are therefore willing to work with the various Europeaninstitutions, for an outcome that is fair andequitable to all stakeholders (paragraphs taken from the article). <a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/development/body/publications/courier/eCourier/ecourier_5_2005_en.pdf" target="_blank">Download PDF</a> </p>

					<p> The European Agriculture Council has agreed a set of reforms to the EU sugar sector that will see an eventual 36% price cut, with beet growers compensated with direct income payments. In addition, there will be a form of quota buyback scheme, funded by those processors staying in the sugar sector paying a levy, which will fund payments to those processors leaving the sector. The net result of the sugar reform is that by 2011, EU sugar production will be reduced by between one quarter to one third from a roughly 20 MMT today (white sugar) to perhaps 13 to 15 MMT. The EU will cease to be a major exporter on world sugar markets and may even become a net sugar importer. The reforms are expected to leave the EU sugar price at roughly double world market prices compared to currently being over triple world prices. <a href="http://www.fas.usda.gov/gainfiles/200512/146131717.pdf" target="_blank">Download PDF</a> </p>

					<p> An aggregate analysis of the impacts of a reform of the CMO sugar is only possible if the economic incentives driving the behaviour of sugar beet producers are understood. Currently, farmers produce considerable quantities above their quota in different EU Member States which cannot be explained with standard profit maximising behaviour. Recent studies have failed to provide a complete framework to explain the observed sugar production. Adenäuer and Heckelei (2005) examine several alternative behavioural models with respect to their ability to give a better explanation for the supply behaviour and would consequently allow for more realistic simulation responses to policy changes (taken from the introduction). <a href="https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/download/2296.pdf" target="_self">Download PDF</a> </p>

					<p> Source: Agricultural Economics Research Institute (LEI), The Hague With high support prices for sugar in the European Union (EU), the group of Less Developed Countries (LDCs) and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries benefit from the present preferential trade agreements with the EU, as they can export to the EU against the high internal EU prices. However, in July 2004 the Commission of the EU proposed a significant reduction of the internal sugar prices and production quota. When the internal EU prices are reduced to levels the Commission proposed in its July 2004 document, only the most competitive LDC/ACP producers would be able to maintain access to the EU market. Model simulations indicate that the consequences of the EU policy reform on EU imports are rather modest: imports from LDCs increase but to a lesser extent than the Commission and other studies indicate. Important trigger points in the evaluation of the impact on trade flows are the degree of substitutability between domestic EU sugar and imported sugar, and potential &quot;swap&quot; or trade diversion effects. Welfare effects are minor to ACP countries as a group, but country effects may differ strongly. The study includes 3 case studies, Ethiopia, Mauritius and Brazil, representing an EBA (&quot;Everything But Arms&quot;), an ACP and a net exporting country with no preferences to the EU market. These case studies show how EU policy changes may affect the sugar industry in developing countries. <a href="http://www.lei.dlo.nl/publicaties/PDF/2005/6_xxx/6_05_09.pdf" target="_blank">Download PDF</a>  Also available at KIT library: KIT (G05-86)</p>

					<p> Source: APRODEV <b> (</b>association of the 17 major development and humanitarian aid organisations in Europe, which work closely together with the World Council of Churches); CIDSE(International Cooperation for Development and Solidarity); both organizations based in Brussels, Belgium APRODEV and CIDSE submitted their position regarding the reform of the EU sugar regime in summer of 2004. This position is still valid, in spite of all the debates over the past year on the first and second EU Commission proposals. Largely in agreement with the EU Parliament, the ACP/LDC countries <i>, </i>the organizations advocate a quota reduction as the principal instrument to implement the WTO Panel rulings, a less radical price reduction (only to the minimum agreed at the WTO negotiations in the Doha Round), the transformation of EBA free market access to import quotas for the LDC, and linkage between these trade preferences with agreed social and environmental standards. Since the EU Commission refuses to renegotiate the EBA initiative, proposals appear to have little hope of being implemented. Therefore APRODEV and CIDSE articulate potentialbenchmarks in this paper with an emphasis on the ACP/LDC issues. The reform proposals for the sugar sector are seriously imbalanced: A significantly higher burden to adapt is placed on the ACP/LDC countries as compared to the EU sugar industry. <a href="http://www.aprodev.net/main/files/APRODEV%20CIDSE%20request%20of%20fair%20share%20of%20burden%20of%20EU%20sugar%20reform%2011-05%20eng.pdf" target="_blank">Download PDF</a> </p>

					<p> Source: APRODEV <b> (</b>association of the 17 major development and humanitarian aid organisations in Europe, which work closely together with the World Council of Churches); CIDSE(International Cooperation for Development and Solidarity); both organizations based in Brussels, Belgium In this paper APRODEV and CIDSE put forward the development case for change by saying that their concerns stem from the social and ecological situation of the sugar economy in developing countries as well as in Europe. Sugar is the internationally traded agricultural product par excellence. That is why every country is affected by the decisions of others. Although sugar cane production and processing from developing countries is more efficient than that of sugar beet, the latter has been able to build its position on the world market thanks to state support. Those who pay in the end are the cane sugar workers, small farmers and their families in developing countries. Women, involved directly or indirectly, in sugar production particularly feel the consequences of the injustice of the EU sugar regime. APRODEV and CIDSE believe that a pro-development reform of the EU Sugar Market Order can make a real difference for these people, giving them a better chance to earn a fair income to make their livelihoods more sustainable. <a href="http://www.unctad.org/infocomm/francais/sucre/doc/EUreform05.pdf" target="_blank">Download PDF</a> </p>

The industry was nationalized in the mid-1970s when the Guyana Sugar Corporation (GuySuCo) was formed as a government-owned entity in 1976 with a production potential of about 380 000 t (96deg) sugar. Declining sugar prices led to a planned reduction of productive capacity to around 250 000 t of sugar during the 1980s. Regrettably, due to lack of investment, labour shortages, and inclement weather, production declined to a level of 132 000 t in 1990. Since then, a carefully planned and managed strategy for agriculture and factory rehabilitation, supported by international financial organizations, has resulted in a production increase of &gt;300 000 t sugar from the reduced land area. This has enabled GuySuCo to consistently meet its preferential market quotas in Europe and the USA and also to expand sales of high-quality brown sugars in the Caribbean. The industry intends to further increase its sugar production to reduce unit costs and increase its market share within the Caribbean, and has plans to move to the sale of electricity to the national grid via co-generation from surplus biomass while extending its capacity for ethanol production.

					<p> <b>Abstract</b>  Training of sugar technologists for the South African industry began in 1928 and developed into a 3-year diploma or 2-year certificate course offered by the Sugar Milling Research Institute (SMRI) in conjunction with local technologists. Approximately 15 years ago, it was perceived that good candidates objected to training which tended to restrict them to working in a single industry. The sugar diploma courses were terminated, and candidates were recruited after they had completed general engineering training. These graduates and diplomates were offered a 3-week course in sugar technology. This was subsequently replaced by an intensive 10-week course to be held every 18 months. Furthermore, an SMRI training officer was seconded to the South African Sugar Association Industrial Training Centre (ITC) to teach sugar manufacture and laboratory worker courses to operators and process supervisors. These courses have recently been extensively restructured to meet new criteria and to keep abreast of the needs of the sugar industry. Details presented pertain to these and other courses, which include a 1-week introductory course and a 2-day course in sugar technology for industry personnel not directly involved in sugar manufacture (e.g. administration, agricultural and engineering maintenance staff). Lectures in sugar technology for the Department of Applied Chemistry, University of Natal, are also considered.

					<p> <b>Abstract</b>  The Sugar Milling Research Institute (SMRI) was founded in 1949 as a joint venture involving Natal Sugar Millers, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the University of Natal, South Africa. In the early years, the SMRI's main priority was the improvement of South African sugar technology by providing training and advisory services, including a factory performance benchmarking service. Research and development was subsequently given higher priority, accompanied by the development of an extensive analytical service. Changes in the funding, staffing, control, services and focus of the Institute are outlined, and examples of achievements are presented. Current trends and technical developments are summarized, and recent changes to facilitate flexibility of response to individual factory requirements are explained. Potential future developments concerning innovations in sugar technology and the role of the SMRI are briefly discussed.

					<p> <b>Abstract</b>  A Cobb-Douglas production function was used to estimate the contribution to productivity (yield/ha) of technology (Zimbabwe Sugar Association Experiment Station expenditure), water (irrigation plus rainfall), production cost index, export price of sugar and area harvested, during the 27-year period of 1970-1996. With a lag of 4 years, the contribution of the technology was found to be 42%. Of the 42%, research was estimated to have contributed 64% and technology transfer 36%, with the latter declining from 62% to 19% over the period. The decline in the yield/ha over the period has resulted in an overall negative technology benefit-cost (B:C) ratio. However, the value of defensive research (against yield decline) is estimated empirically as 19% of the total value of the industry with a B:C ratio of 2.5.

					<p> <b>Abstract</b>  The potential of weather-based decision support through the Internet for agronomic management of sugar cane crops is examined. A system has been developed to capture and process automatically near real-time weather data and to provide Internet access to apply the CANESIM model interactively to these data. The system functions reasonably smoothly and can be used to assist in irrigation management, yield benchmarking and estimation. The system has not been operational long enough to assess the extent of the use and the impact it will have on agrotechnology transfer in the South African sugar industry. Extension officers, growers and millers will be involved with the further development of this facility. <i>In: Proceedings-South-African-Sugar-Technologists'-Association, no. 73, p. 30-32</i> </p>

					<p> <b>Abstract</b>  Some of the key factors and issues that will impact the commercial viability of bio-ethanol projects are examined for major sugar producing countries such as Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico, Thailand and the USA. There remain many obstacles when considering future prospects and the commercial viability of bio-ethanol from sugar crops. The renewed enthusiasm for bio-ethanol by some advocates in the ethanol and sugar sectors is understandable in light of the sharp spike in oil prices to a 10-year high and growing environmental concerns. National governments are, however, reluctant to consider long-term support for ethanol production from sugar crops, especially in an environment where future oil prices and sugar prices are uncertain; where climate change policy is only likely to seriously improve the position of biofuels in the transport sector over the longer term; and where pressures are already building for governments presently subsidizing bio-ethanol production to reform those very support mechanisms in the spirit of the WTO (World Trade Organization) trade liberalization agreements. <i>In: Sugar-Cane-International (UK), no. 2, p. 6-14</i> </p>
