They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p> Data collected from 281 villages in Congo (Kinshasa), Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda as part of the Collaborative Study of Cassava in Africa (COSCA, 1989-1997) show that new high-yielding TMS varieties have transformed cassava from a low-yielding, famine-reserve crop to a low-cost, high-yielding cash crop for both rural and urban consumers. As the TMS varieties increased farm level cassava yields by 40% without the addition of fertilizer, they were quickly adopted by farmers in Nigeria, Ghana, and elsewhere in the 1980s and 1990s. The 5 common myths and half-truths that have contributed to the low priority that cassava has been given in research and food production programmes are discussed and the policy implications of the COSCA findings are outlined. Other subjects include: (1) cassava's roles as famine-reserve crop, rural and urban food staple, cash crop, industrial raw material, and livestock feed; (2) cassava varieties; (3) pests and diseases; (4) yield and production trends; (5) plant breeding and farmer-led research; (6) agronomic practices; (7) the preparation of fresh roots, dried roots, pasta products, granulated products, and leaves; (8) mechanized processing; (9) shifts in gender roles; (10) consumption and income elasticity of demand; (11) pre- and post-harvest losses; and (12) cassava-based malt beer and ethanol production.</p>

					<p> In Malawi, environmental heterogeneity requires the costly assessment of new cassava genotypes at many sites. A study was conducted to test the feasibility of selecting only a few locations for cassava evaluation that would be representative of all the agro-ecologies in which cassava is grown in Malawi. Enormous environmental effects, largely contributed by the interaction between season and location, were manifested. Genotype x environment interaction (GEI), due largely to a third level interaction (genotype x season x location), was highly significant for all the traits studied. A principal component analysis scatter plot showed no particular grouping of environments, but a pair-wise comparison showed that some of the locations had limited GEI, indicating that it would be sufficient to use one of these sites for evaluating these traits. The value of the residual was often large, probably as an effect of environmental heterogeneity in the test sites. Cassava genetic improvement will continue to be slow if Malawi is used as a single breeding zone. A much finer grouping of the locations and the use of smaller plot sizes would allow more clones to be tested at more sites for the same cost. Locations may be selected for intensive breeding work from those that give the best discrimination between genotypes while having insignificant GEI in a relatively large number of environments.

					<p> In 2000 and 2001, on-farm trials were carried out at 7 sites on Unguja and PembaIslands of Zanzibar, Tanzania, to evaluate improved clones of cassava under farmers' conditions for their resistance to pests and diseases, yield, and other characteristics preferred by farmers. The local bred breeding lines ZNZ/98/010, ZNZ/98/036, ZNZ/98/084, ZNZ/98/043, and ZNZ/98/034 were compared with Boma (local best) and an introduced variety, H.46106/27. It was found that farmers preferred the clones ZNZ/98/036, ZNZ/98/034, and ZNZ/98/084 because of their sweetness, disease resistance, root yields, and dry matter content.

					<p> A survey was conducted among about 180 farmers in NkhataBay, Lilongwe East, Mulanje, Mzimba, and Lilongwe West, in Malawi to fill gaps in existing baseline information on the varieties of cassava and sweet potato grown, the sources of planting material, processing, household utilization, and yields. Farmers mainly grow local cassava varieties with their own gardens as the main source of planting materials. Several varieties of sweet potato are grown with Kenya (bred in Tanzania) as the most popular. Cassava and sweet potato are grown for food and cash. In some area cassava stems are used as fuel wood. Most farmers do not store fresh cassava roots, but process them into &quot;makaka&quot; (non-fermented dried chips), &quot;kanyakaska&quot; and &quot;kadonoska&quot;, or sell them fresh. Processing of sweet potato is limited to boiling and roasting. Most farmers store sweet potato, but this is constrained by sweet potato weevil damage and rotting. Root yields ranged from 13.1 to 31.4 t/ha for cassava, and from 10.2 to 14.0 t/ha for sweet potato. Unavailability of acceptable improved varieties, high incidence of pests and diseases, and poor cultural practices are the main causes of relatively low yields.

					<p> A field guide was elaborated to help extension workers in advising farmers to: (1) choose appropriate sites for cassava cultivation; (2) improve soil fertility; (3) select the best cassava varieties; and (4) plant healthy cuttings. A prospective cassava field must have dense vegetation, a loamy soil texture, and no or only a slight slope. The best varieties are rich in dry matter, brittle, conserve well in the soil, are well adapted to the zone, produce tubers early and are easy to process. Only use healthy cuttings from the central, brown part of the stem. The cuttings should be 20-25 cm long with 5-8 nodes. Parts that are affected by pest insects should be dipped in hot water for 5-10 min and treated with a pesticide. If not, plant the cuttings horizontally. Make ridges in fields affected by waterlogging. Plant the cuttings vertically in sandy soils and inclined in loamy soils. In pure stands the spacing should be 1 m. In the case of intercropping, use adequate spacing.</p>

					<p> The effectiveness of plastic packaging and fungicide treatment in prolonging the shelf-life of fresh cassava roots for marketing was verified and the acceptability of the plastic-packed cassava (PPC) among urban consumers was determined, using CebuCity and TaclobanCity in the Philippines as pilot sites. Of the 1911 packs delivered to the different outlets, 1769 packs (93%) were sold. In the follow-up survey, it was found that the PPC was generally acceptable among urban consumers. All of the 380 respondents indicated that they would like to continue buying PPC. Among the reasons cited were: the roots remained fresh even if they were stocked for several days (36.8%); the roots tasted sweet and juicy when cooked (32.6%); and the price (15 pesos/pack of 2 kg) was reasonable (18.7%).

					<p> During 1994-1996, field experiments were conducted under contrasting ecological conditions at 2 sites in southern Cameroon to study the reversion phenomenon in cassava, in particular the extent to which the virus causing cassava mosaic disease (CMD) was absent from cuttings collected from CMD-affected plants. Cuttings were taken from the basal, middle and upper portions of the stems of diseased plants of susceptible and partially resistant cassava cultivars. The proportions of disease-free shoots developing from the different batches of cuttings were recorded to indicate the extent of reversion. This was significantly less frequent in cv. Red Local (5-43%) than in the susceptible cv. Bambui Local (65%) and cv. Improved (70%), which is partially resistant. Reversion was higher with cuttings collected from the youngest portions of the stem compared with older portions and with short cuttings (5, 10 cm) compared with those 20 or 25 cm long. There was a significant negative correlation between symptom severity in different cultivars and the extent of reversion. This was greater at the lowland site than at mid-altitude. To assess the effect of CMD in cassava the Disease Index (DI) was developed. It was found that the DI could be used to identify cultivars on the basis of their ability to revert from CMD and the severity of CMD on the non-reverted plants.

					<p> In south-western Nigeria, 13 cassava genotypes were evaluated for anthracnose (CAD; <i>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</i>), bacterial blight (CBB; <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i>) and cassava mosaic disease (CMD) incidence and severity, and their effects on yield, for 3 consecutive planting seasons. There were significant differences in CAD, CBB and CMD incidence and severity among the cassava genotypes across the planting seasons. Yield assessment showed significant differences among the genotypes in storage root number, plant stand, root fresh weight and dry matter content. There was no significant variation in tuber rot among the genotypes, and 80% of the genotypes did not show any tuber root rot when harvested 12 months after planting. The CBB and CAD incidences were significantly and positively correlated, whereas CBB and CMD incidences were not significantly correlated. The CAD and CMD incidence and severity were highly correlated. The CBB incidence was negatively correlated with storage root weight and fresh root tuber number. The CMD severity showed a significant negative correlation with storage root weight. Cassava genotypes TMS30001, 30211 and 88/01087 showed a stable resistance over 3 planting seasons to CAD, CBB and CMD.

					<p> The literature on cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) is reviewed and areas that require further research are identified. Cassava is an important subsistence food crop in Africa where it is affected by 2 main virus diseases, cassava mosaic disease (CMD) and CBSD. The CBSD occurs mainly on the East African coast, and although the disease was first reported in 1936, it has received much less attention than CMD. The aetiology and epidemiology of CBSD are still not fully elucidated, and no insect vector has been identified. There is renewed interest in CBSD owing to the discovery of its widespread occurrence in southern Tanzania and Mozambique, where the associated symptom of root necrosis is a major cause of economic loss in the cassava crop. The whiteflies <i>Bemisia afer</i> and <i>Bemisia tabaci</i> are the leading candidates as the vector of CBSV, and one of the most pressing research needs is transmission tests with these insects. In addition, it should be determined if common weeds such as <i>Datura stramonium</i>, which is susceptible to sap transmission, can be infected by vector transmission. New diagnostic methods need to be tested in Tanzania and elsewhere and used to try to detect cassava brown streak virus in symptomless plants.

					<p> Host plant resistance (HPR) to whiteflies is rare in cultivated crops. A literature search revealed that HPR research with the <i>Bemisia tabaci</i>/ <i>Bemisia argentifolii</i> complex has increased considerably in recent years, but large-scale screening of a wide selection of genotypes is limited. At the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) in Colombia, more than 5000 cassava clones have been evaluated for resistance to <i>Aleurotrachelus socialis</i>. Several cultivars with high levels of resistance have been identified. Nymphal mortality was highest on the resistant cassava clone, M Ecu 72 (72.5%) and lowest on the susceptible clones CMC 40 (33%) and M Bra 12 (25%). When feeding on resistant genotypes, <i>A. socialis</i> had less oviposition, longer development periods, reduced size and higher mortality than when feeding on susceptible ones. Mortality is highest during the nymphal stages. Several whitefly resistant hybrids have been developed using M Ecu 72 as the resistant female parent. Three hybrids are being evaluated for release by the Colombian Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

					<p> For energy security and environmental improvement reasons, the Chinese government is developing biomass ethanol as one of its transportation fuels. Cassava is a good feedstock to produce this ethanol because it has a high starch content and it is abundant in the southern provinces. A computer-based cost model has been developed to assess the life cycle economics of ethanol produced from cassava. The results are compared to gasoline as a base-line case. Although ethanol fuel is not currently competitive with conventional gasoline, these life cycle cost results indicate that, at present market prices, ethanol has the potential to be competitive if there are incentives and improved cassava yields. In addition, this renewable energy could help to alleviate poverty, improve land utilization and bring energy independence in Guangxi province in southeast China. This computer model will be an important tool for the energy policy makers to understand whether an energy alternative is cost-competitive, as well as providing a way to find appropriate measures throughout the entire life cycle that optimizes the process and removes the economic barriers. <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/13640321;jsessionid=7dtfspiqg0mod.victoria" target="_blank"> <b>Download document</b> </a>  <i>Access to this article is through a website external to IngentaConnect.

					<p> When complex organizational, institutional, technical (production, processing) and market constraints and needs are being faced by limited resources, innovative R&amp;D methodologies are required for appropriate, efficient and effective solutions. In 1996, more than 200 cassava starch processing households were being faced by a myriad of problems regarding their small agro-industries, resulting in poor social &amp; economic conditions. This was further aggrevated by serious public order problems due to violent actions of ' <i>guerilla</i>' groups throughout Cauca Valley, Colombia. Demands for intervention from farmer/processor groups and local institutions led to an innovative R&amp;D action plan. Several principal approaches were combined for this R&amp;D action plan: <i>(i) integration of the </i><i>principal actors and activities in the production to consumption chain; (ii) integration of </i><i>client opinions with expert analyses; (iii) prioritization and consensus among stakeholders;and (iv) optimization of project resources efficiency.</i>  <a href="http://webapp.ciat.cgiar.org/agroempresas/pdf/clientled-agroindustrial_valley_cauca.pdf" target="_blank"> <b>Download PDF</b> </a> </p>

					<p> In Nigeria and Ghana, four key factors are driving the cassava transformation. First, the IITA’ s new high-yielding Tropical Manioc Selection (TMS) varieties boosted cassava yield by 40 percent without fertilizer application. Second, high consumer demand for cassava by rural and urban households fueled the producer incentive to plant more land to cassava. Third, the use of the mechanical grater to prepare <i>gari </i>released labor, especially female labor, from processing for planting more cassava. Fourth, the Africa-wide biological control program averted the devastating cassava mealybug epidemic. Summarized, the key lesson from the 40 years, form the early 1960s to early 2000s, of the cassava transformation in Nigeria and Ghana is that cassava is a powerful poverty fighter in Africa. Enhancing the value of cassava as a powerful poverty fighter in Africa poses the following challenges to the African political leaders and policy makers and to cassava researchers and donors: The resumption of long-term core research funding for cassava research in Africa is critical and urgent; (2) If any cassava harvesting or peeling machine designed for smallholders can be identified anywhere in the world it should be urgently put to on-farm test in Africa with a view to adapt, fabricate, and diffuse it to farmers if confirmed suitable in the on-farm testing; (3) If available machines cannot be confirmed suitable for the smallholder use, cassava breeding and engineering research should be initiated with engineers and breeders working hand in hand to develop cassava varieties that can be harvested and processed mechanically and the harvesting and the processing machines for the smallholders (4) African governments need to encourage their private sectors, for example with intellectual property rights protection, to make the necessary investments in developing technologies for expanded use of cassava as raw material in the livestock feed, food, and non-food industries within Africa.

					<p> Breeding goals of yield increases, root quality improvement, and disease resistance in cassava are considerably slowed down by biological characteristics of the crop, which includes a long growth cycle, a heterozygous genetic background and a poor knowledge of the organization of crop diversity. These factors severely hamper the speed and ease of moving around useful genes in cassava. The consequences are that cassava production fails to keep up with demand, especially in regions where over 90% of yield is consumed as food, leading to an increase in acreage of cassava fields mostly into marginal lands. The advent of molecular markers, genome studies and plant genetic transformation holds promise of providing ways around breeding obstacles in long growth cycle and heterozygous crops. A number of these new tools, including a molecular genetic map, markers linked to disease resistance genes, and marker-aided studies of complex traits now exist or are being developed for cassava at CIAT. Large scale sequencing and mapping of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have been initiated, towards a transcript map of cassava and the implementation of the candidate-gene approach to complex trait mapping. A cassava bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library has also been constructed to expedite positional cloning of genes, known only by their phenotypes and their position relative to markers on a molecular genetic map and complementation studies of candidate loci. Studies of genes that control traits of agronomic importance, and their allelic diversity in nature, provides powerful tools for understanding the basis of crop performance and improvement. <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/(sakltn55wbravi55c5dkgo45)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,19,19;journal,74,151;linkingpublicationresults,1:102881,1" target="_blank">Download document</a> </p>

					<p> The capacity to integrate transgenes into the tropical root crop cassava ( <i>Manihot esculenta</i> Crantz) is now established and being utilized to generate plants expressing traits of agronomic interest. The tissue culture and gene transfer systems currently employed to produce these transgenic cassava have improved significantly over the past 5 years and are assessed and compared in this review. Programs are underway to develop cassava with enhanced resistance to viral diseases and insects pests, improved nutritional content, modified and increased starch metabolism and reduced cyanogenic content of processed roots. Each of these is described individually for the underlying biology the molecular strategies being employed and progress achieved towards the desired product. Important advances have occurred, with transgenic plants from several laboratories being prepared for field trails. <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/(yqam2w45fhvkw3f3000nsr45)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,16,16;journal,21,152;linkingpublicationresults,1:100330,1" target="_blank">Download document</a> </p>

 <b> <i>Cassava Alcohol</i> </b> 
Cassava is one of the richest fermentable substances for the production of alcohol. The fresh roots contain about 30 percent starch and 5 percent sugars, and the dried roots contain about 80 percent fermentable substances which are equivalent to rice as a source of alcohol. 
Ethyl alcohol is produced from many carbohydrate materials.

					<p> The project Portfolio of CPHP online provides an overview of projects undertaken or being undertaken. Below a project summary is given of a two year project on market opportunities of cassava in Ghana from the beginning of 2003 to the end of 2004. Cassava is a key crop in Ghana, and is important to low-income farmers (including many women). Cassava surpluses increased from 2 to 3.5 million metric tonnes between 1995 and 2001. Needs assessment studies have highlighted farmers concerns to expand market opportunities for cassava. Market opportunities (food, paperboard, plywood, textiles, industrial alcohol) exist in Ghana that would enable cassava to contribute significantly to poor people’s livelihoods. This project seeks to improve rural livelihoods, through industrialisation of cassava, via the establishment of an integrated supply chain to provide manufacturers with an assured supply of consistent quality cassava products at a competitive price.</p>
