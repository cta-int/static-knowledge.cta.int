						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Aquaculture is the fastest-developing branch of the global food industry, with annual growth of 9 %. This rapid rise is pushing up demand for fish feed and the supply of fishmeal and fish oil – important ingredients in feed – is dwindling. They are set to be replaced by crops such as soya, maize and rape, but feed pellets made from them might contain pesticides. Scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME) in Schmallenberg, Germany have developed a system to test whether chemical substances accumulate in fish that are fed contaminated feed. In autumn 2011, the European Commission will publish new data requirements for fish as part of the approval process for pesticides. These will oblige every producer and importer who intends to bring a new pesticide onto the European market not only to register it but also to provide information proving it cannot accumulate in the edible parts of fish. The fish test developed at the IME will supply the information required.

					<p>An international team of researchers has reviewed the evidence linking exposure to atrazine -- an herbicide widely used in the U.S. and more than 60 other nations -- to reproductive problems in animals. The team found consistent patterns of reproductive dysfunction in amphibians, fish, reptiles and mammals exposed to the chemical. Atrazine is the second-most widely used herbicide in the U.S. More than 75 million pounds of it are applied to corn and other crops, and it is the most commonly detected pesticide contaminant of groundwater, surface water and rain in the U.S. The new review, compiled by 22 scientists studying atrazine in North and South America, Europe and Japan, looked at studies linking atrazine exposure to abnormal androgen (male hormone) levels in fish, amphibians, reptiles and mammals and studies that found a common association between exposure to the herbicide and the &quot;feminization&quot; of male gonads in many animals.

					<p>Over the last two years the Kenyan Government has funded the construction of 46,000 fish ponds in 160 of the 210 constituencies in the country. The government has also provided catfish and tilapia fingerlings and fish feed as a start up measure, but many farmers have little access to basic extension services or long-term access to inputs. To complement and enhance the government's extension services in aquaculture, FARM-Africa has established six franchised Aqua Shops in western Kenya to provide smallholders with inputs and technical advice on best aquaculture practices. The hubs also provide market information and teach fish farmers how to link their businesses with markets to generate additional income. Over 600 farmers have also been trained and equipped to set up and run viable fish farming businesses.

WRI and its local partners have conducted economic valuation studies of coral reefs and mangroves at national and subnational levels in five countries: Trinidad and Tobago, St. Lucia, Belize, the Dominican Republic and, in June 2011, Jamaica. WRI has published (June 2011) a Working Paper on the coastal capital of <a href="http://www.wri.org/publication/coastal-capital-jamaica" target="_blank">Jamaica</a> with an interesting <a href="http://www.wri.org/stories/2011/06/jamaicas-coastal-capital-risk-report-field" target="_blank">field report</a>.

	Research by Dr Johnathan Kool (and colleagues) of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies and James Cook University (Australia), has established that the richest marine region on Earth – the Coral Triangle between Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines – depends vitally for its diversity and resilience on coral and fish larvae swept in from the South China Sea and Solomon Islands. An international scientific team has shown that strong links between the corals reefs of the south China sea, West Pacific and Coral Triangle hold the key to preserving fish and marine resources in the Asia-Pacific region. Maintaining the network of links between reefs allowing larvae to flow between them and re-stock depleted areas, is key to saving coral ecosystems threatened by human pressure and climate change. Six nations within the Coral Triangle (Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, The Solomon Islands and Timor L’Este) are now working together to strengthen coral reef governance and management, under an arrangement known as the <a href="http://www.cti-secretariat.net" target="_blank">Coral Triangle Initiative</a>. The paper &quot;Connectivity and the development of population genetic structure in Indo-West Pacific coral reef communities&quot; by Johnathan T. Kool, Claire B. Paris, Paul H. Barber and Robert K. Cowen appears in a recent issue of the journal <i>Global Ecology and Biogeography</i>.(Source: ARC, 22 Feb.2011)</p>

	Conservation International (CI, Arlington, USA) published a series of reports showing that marine managed areas in developing countries can help reverse declining fisheries while generating long-term benefits for communities. The reports, informed by more than 50 studies and 100 scientists in 23 countries around the world since 2005, evaluate the role of marine managed areas (MMAs) in maintaining ocean health, assess the link between sustainable ocean use and human well-being, and architect what it takes to successfully implement MMAs. The reports argue that MMAs will be critical to halt continuing the decline in marine fisheries. The reports were produced by a global network of 75 organizations known as the ‘Science-to-Action’ partnership, primarily under a grant from The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.

					<p>A five-day conference on fish conservation was held at United Nations Headquarters in New York on 24-29 May 2010, amid warnings that three quarters of the world’s fish stocks are in distress and nearing depletion while marine ecosystems continue to deteriorate. The conference reviewed implementation of the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement that established a legal regime for long-term conservation and sustainable use of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks. It provided an opportunity for countries to consider new measures to tighten implementation of the legal regime. Participants focused on how to bolster the region’s commitment to ratify the protocol concerning pollution from land-based sources and Activities, or the LBS Protocol. So far, only six countries – Panama, Belize, Saint Lucia, France, the United States and Trinidad and Tobago – have ratified the LBS Protocol.

					<p>Closing fishing areas and regulating the use of fishing gear can result in more profitable catches that boost fishermen's incomes, according to a study. The conclusion has emerged from a long-term investigation in Kenya on the effects of fishery closures on fishermen's profits. The study, published in <i>Conservation Biology</i>, used data on 27,000 fish caught in three locations off the Kenyan coast over a period of 12 years. The study was unusual because it differentiated the effects of fishery closures from those of other initiatives. (Source: SciDev, 21 May 2010) </p>

	A new collaboration between Norway and South Africa will collect oceanic data to help better understand and cope with the effects of climate change across Africa. The Nansen-Tutu Centre for Marine Environmental Research was launched on 20 May 2010 in Cape Town, South Africa. It will gather information on the three oceans surrounding southern Africa – the South Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean and the Southern Ocean. The centre will carry out systematic and long-term measurements of the oceans and will also develop new methods of data integration. The research will focus on modelling the state of the oceans, the marine environment and ecosystems, and the relationship between climate anomalies in different parts of the world.

					<p>Already under threat from over-fishing, habitat loss and weak management, fisheries and aquaculture are in a poor position to cope with the effects of climate change. Rising sea temperatures are predicted to drive most marine species towards the poles - increasing the populations of warmer-water species and decreasing populations of colder-water species. For example, fish adapted to narrow temperature ranges, such as Atlantic salmon, &quot;may be extirpated from their present habitats because of the combined impacts of warming, changing habitats, introduced competitors and predators and increased parasitism,&quot; the study found.

					<p>A landmark treaty that aims to shut down ports to illegal fishing vessels has been approved by the FAO. This will be the first ever legally-binding global pact that commits governments to prevent, deter and eventually eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing by taking steps to guard their ports against ships engaged in such illicit practices and consequently preventing their catch from entering international markets. Eleven FAO members – Angola, Brazil, Chile, the EC, Indonesia, Iceland, Norway, Samoa, Sierra Leone, the United States and Uruguay – signed the treaty immediately following its approval by the agency’s Governing Conference. IUU fishing damages the productivity of fisheries and could lead to their collapse, FAO warned. Operating without proper authorization, catching protected species, using outlawed types of gear or disregarding catch quotas are among the most common unlawful activities.

					<p>Fish populations in the tropics could fall by as much as 40% over the next half century because of global warming, jeopardising a vital food source for the developing world, a new study published in the Global Change Biology journal has found. The waters off Indonesia - which rank among the most plentiful areas for fish today - could see supplies fall by well over 20% by 2055 because of changes in ocean conditions. Fishermen operating in US coastal waters (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) could also face large declines in fish stocks, as would those working off Chile and China. However, not all regions would be losers. Cooler climates would see their catch potential rise by between 30% and 70% by 2055, with Norway, Greenland, Alaska and the east coast of Russia seeing the biggest increases. While the overall productivity of the world's oceans will remain roughly the same, the sharp declines in fish stocks in Asia, the Caribbean, and semi-enclosed seas like the Mediterranean could cause severe shortfalls in some of the poorest regions of the world.

A little-known EU regulation coming into force in January next year could have a major impact on the health of fishing industries in developing countries. The EU is the single largest consumer of fish in the world, accounting for around 40 per cent of global imports. Such is the continent’s appetite for aquatic life; the cumulative net fish exports from developing countries now exceed earnings from coffee, bananas and rubber.But near-unfettered access to the European market for developing countries is set to end with the adoption of new legislation to help eradicate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing practices and ensure the sustainability of worldwide fish stocks.

	Experts warn that the world's growing population is depleting the world's wild fish stocks. The FAO says 70 percent of all the worlds' fisheries are barely able to replenish themselves at current catch rates. Cliff Goudey of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Offshore Aquaculture Engineering Center is developing a solution by building fish cages that can move under their own power. In future, giant, autonomous cages may whir as fish farms through the open ocean, mimicking the movements of wild schools or even allowing fish to forage ‘free range’ before capturing them once again. This technology gives fish farmers a way to rotate cage locations without towing cages behind boats.</p>

					<p>A killer disease is decimating fish stocks in the Zambezi River Valley, threatening the food security and livelihoods of rural populations in an area shared by seven countries, FAO warned on July 21 2009. An alert issued by FAO’s Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS) said the disease, known as Epizootic Ulcerative Syndrome, or EUS, is caused by the fungus Aphanomyces invadans, which forms ugly lesions on fish and has a high rate of mortality. It is one of the most serious aquatic diseases affecting finfish. “If not properly contained there is the risk of the disease spreading to other countries surrounding the Zambezi River as well as river systems in the region,” said Rohana Subasinghe, Senior Fishery Resources Officer. The 1,390,000 km² Zambezi River Basin is home to some 32 million people, of whom 80 percent are dependent on agriculture or fishing and fish farming. (Source: FAO, 21 July 2009)</p>

					<p>On the first-ever UN World Oceans Day (June 8 2009) FAO has published a set of <a href="http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/newsroom/docs/i0816t.pdf" target="_blank">technical guidelines</a> aimed at helping the fisheries sector reduce its impacts on fragile deep-sea fish species and ecosystems.The guidelines provide a framework that countries can use, individually and in the context of regional fisheries management organizations, to manage deep sea fisheries (DSF) in high-seas areas outside of national jurisdictions. The guidelines prescribe steps for identifying and protecting vulnerable ocean ecosystems and provide guidance on the sustainable use of marine living resources in deep-sea areas. They also outline ways that information on the location and status of vulnerable marine ecosystems, including vulnerable deep-sea fish stocks, should be improved. (Source: FAO, 8 July 2009)</p>
