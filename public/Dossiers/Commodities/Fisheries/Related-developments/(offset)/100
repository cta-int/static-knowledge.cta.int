They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>A study led by the Wildlife Conservation Society on more than 40 coral reefs in the Indian and Pacific Oceans indicates that ‘co-management’ – a collaborative arrangement between local communities, conservation groups, and governments – provides one solution to the global problem: overfishing. The finding is the outcome of the largest field investigation of co-managed tropical coral reef fisheries ever conducted, an effort in which researchers studied 42 managed reef systems in five countries. The study's main finding is that co-management has been largely successful in sustaining fisheries and improving people's livelihoods. More than half the fisherfolk surveyed felt co-management was positive for their livelihoods, whereas only 9% felt it was negative. A comparison of co-managed reefs with other reefs showed that co-managed reefs were half as likely to be heavily overfished. Dr. Nick Graham, who worked on the project, said: ‘[...] we also found that where fisheries are closest to big, hungry markets, they tend to be in worse shape. This strongly suggests globalized food chains can undermine local, democratic efforts to manage fisheries better. People often assume that local population size is the main driver of overfishing – but our research shows that access to global markets and seafood dependence are more important, and provide possible levers for action.’(<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-03/wcs-ost031912.php" target="_blank">EurekAlert</a>, 19/03/2012)</p>

					<p>Research led by the University of East Anglia (UEA), UK, challenges previously held notions about poverty and adaptation by investigating why fishermen stick with their trade despite dwindling catches. The research team surveyed almost 600 fishers in five African countries and found that half of the fishermen would not be tempted to seek out a new livelihood - even if their catch declined by 50%. Fishermen in the more vibrant and developed economies were less likely to give up the trade than those from poorer communities. The researchers noted that fishermen in Madagascar, a country they rated as poor, would sooner leave the fisheries sector than those in the Seychelles, a wealthier country. Decisions are influenced by much more than simple profitability; the fishermen also consider job satisfaction, family tradition, sense of identity among a range of other factors. Fisheries are challenged by the combined effects of overfishing, climate change, deteriorating ecosystems and conservation policies. Understanding how fishermen respond to these changes is critical to managing fisheries, and identifying intervention points for conservation policies, the authors believe.

					<p>Researchers from the University of British Columbia, Canada, presented at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), new results from a case study that found that fishing agreements between the European Union (EU) and Madagascar, for access to Madagascar's seafood, are not as fair as they may appear on paper. The problem is rooted in incomplete data about fisheries, the authors believe. The official numbers from the UN underestimate how much fishing fleets around the world catch, because they exclude smaller-scale operations and recreational activities. Analysis indicates that when these data are included, the final fisheries catches can be six times higher than commercial catch numbers alone.

					<p>A research project fostered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's (IUCN ) Commission on Ecosystem Management which involved both conservation and fisheries scientists, aimed at understanding the impsact of fisheries on marine ecosystems. The related paper titled 'Reconsidering the Consequences of Selective Fisheries' concludes that a moderate level of fishing – spread across a wide range of species, stocks and sizes – can achieve high catch levels while conserving biodiversity. In contrast, increasing fishing selectivity to catch a small group of species and sizes neither maximises production nor minimises the ecological effects of fishing. The authors show that heavy selective fishing has caused structural changes to fish communities in the North Sea and elsewhere. By contrast, in several African small-scale inland fisheries, the fish size spectrum – a measure of ecological community structure – has been maintained under intensive and diverse fishing activities that cause high mortality with low selectivity (i.e. diverse catches). Implementing balanced harvesting requires coordinated management at an ecosystem level across all fisheries in a region. Ecosystem modelling could help in determining appropriate patterns of fishing. Markets and the processing sector in some regions would need encouragement to accommodate sizes and species not traditionally utilised.Visit website for more details: <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/03/120315095801.htm" target="_self">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/03/120315095801.htm</a></p>

					<p>An international team of scientists has discovered that the effect of fishing for tuna and similar species since the early 1960s has led to a decline in these populations by around 60%. The results have raised red flags, highlighting how several fish species have been overexploited, and particularly how the majority of tuna fish have been exploited to the limits of sustainability. Researchers from Canada, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom have identified how cold water tuna is the species hardest hit by exploitation, with data showing that their numbers have shrunk by 80%. The Atlantic bluefin and the southern bluefin are part of this group, which is known for being big, long living, and of significant economic value. Another species, the mackerel, has also felt the effect in its numbers. Despite being smaller and having shorter lifespans, mackerel are part of a growing and worrisome trend. The study's findings suggest that fishing knows no boundaries: large or small, all species are at risk. The findings suggest that boosting hauls could continue to be a risky act, and that any global fishing effort must be followed with a great deal of care as demand continues to grow.

					<p>Cornell animal science professor Xingen Lei is testing marine algae as a new protein-rich source of feed to supplement and replace some of the corn and soybean meal mix traditionally given to food-producing animals. This could transform a biofuel by-product into a valuable commodity, potentially freeing thousands of acres of crop land. Algae produces 50 times more oil per acre than corn, with a much smaller carbon footprint; uses nutrients more efficiently than land plants, with no runoff; and places no demand on high-quality agricultural land or freshwater supplies. The average pig consumes about 660 pounds of feed by the time it goes to market, Lei said, so replacing just 10 percent of that feed with algae would save a whopping 33 million tons. Lei and his researchers are now working to determine which algae are best, and the proper ratios of algae, soybean and corn. They are also discerning whether there are risks or additional health benefits for humans in resultant products, such as meat and eggs.

					<p>A WCS (World Conservation Society ) marine project to reduce by-catch in Kenya and Curacao through a low-cost, low-tech fish trap design has won top honour in a contest sponsored by Rare, in partnership with National Geographic.The contest, ‘<i>Solution Search: Turning the Tide for Coastal Fisheries’</i>, promotes fish traps with rectangular gaps that permit small, juvenile fish to escape. The wining project entitled ‘Bycatch Escape Gaps for Fish Traps’, reduces by-catch by 80 percent. It offers coastal fishers a low-cost, low-tech means of maintaining sustainable fisheries in coastal East Africa, the Caribbean, and other regions using traditional fish traps. Solutions submitted for the contest included the implementation of no-take zones, introduction of innovative fishing gear and the development of alternative livelihoods.(<a href="http://www.wcs.org/news-and-features-main/grand-prize-for-fisheries-project.aspx%20" target="_blank">WCS</a> via <a href="http://news.mongabay.com/2012/0111-hance_fishtrap_bycatch.html" target="_blank">Mongabay</a>, 11/01/2011)</p>

					<p>Aquaculture is the fastest-developing branch of the global food industry, with annual growth of 9 %. This rapid rise is pushing up demand for fish feed and the supply of fishmeal and fish oil – important ingredients in feed – is dwindling. They are set to be replaced by crops such as soya, maize and rape, but feed pellets made from them might contain pesticides. Scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME) in Schmallenberg, Germany have developed a system to test whether chemical substances accumulate in fish that are fed contaminated feed. In autumn 2011, the European Commission will publish new data requirements for fish as part of the approval process for pesticides. These will oblige every producer and importer who intends to bring a new pesticide onto the European market not only to register it but also to provide information proving it cannot accumulate in the edible parts of fish. The fish test developed at the IME will supply the information required.

					<p>An international team of researchers has reviewed the evidence linking exposure to atrazine -- an herbicide widely used in the U.S. and more than 60 other nations -- to reproductive problems in animals. The team found consistent patterns of reproductive dysfunction in amphibians, fish, reptiles and mammals exposed to the chemical. Atrazine is the second-most widely used herbicide in the U.S. More than 75 million pounds of it are applied to corn and other crops, and it is the most commonly detected pesticide contaminant of groundwater, surface water and rain in the U.S. The new review, compiled by 22 scientists studying atrazine in North and South America, Europe and Japan, looked at studies linking atrazine exposure to abnormal androgen (male hormone) levels in fish, amphibians, reptiles and mammals and studies that found a common association between exposure to the herbicide and the &quot;feminization&quot; of male gonads in many animals.

	Research by Dr Johnathan Kool (and colleagues) of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies and James Cook University (Australia), has established that the richest marine region on Earth – the Coral Triangle between Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines – depends vitally for its diversity and resilience on coral and fish larvae swept in from the South China Sea and Solomon Islands. An international scientific team has shown that strong links between the corals reefs of the south China sea, West Pacific and Coral Triangle hold the key to preserving fish and marine resources in the Asia-Pacific region. Maintaining the network of links between reefs allowing larvae to flow between them and re-stock depleted areas, is key to saving coral ecosystems threatened by human pressure and climate change. Six nations within the Coral Triangle (Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, The Solomon Islands and Timor L’Este) are now working together to strengthen coral reef governance and management, under an arrangement known as the <a href="http://www.cti-secretariat.net" target="_blank">Coral Triangle Initiative</a>. The paper &quot;Connectivity and the development of population genetic structure in Indo-West Pacific coral reef communities&quot; by Johnathan T. Kool, Claire B. Paris, Paul H. Barber and Robert K. Cowen appears in a recent issue of the journal <i>Global Ecology and Biogeography</i>.(Source: ARC, 22 Feb.2011)</p>

	Conservation International (CI, Arlington, USA) published a series of reports showing that marine managed areas in developing countries can help reverse declining fisheries while generating long-term benefits for communities. The reports, informed by more than 50 studies and 100 scientists in 23 countries around the world since 2005, evaluate the role of marine managed areas (MMAs) in maintaining ocean health, assess the link between sustainable ocean use and human well-being, and architect what it takes to successfully implement MMAs. The reports argue that MMAs will be critical to halt continuing the decline in marine fisheries. The reports were produced by a global network of 75 organizations known as the ‘Science-to-Action’ partnership, primarily under a grant from The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.

					<p>The world's oceans are virtually choking on rising greenhouse gases, destroying marine ecosystems and breaking down the food chain -- irreversible changes that have not occurred for several million years, a new study says. The changes could have dire consequences for hundreds of millions of people around the globe who rely on oceans for their livelihoods. The Australia-U.S. report, published in Science magazine on the 18th of June, studied 10 years of marine research and found that climate change was causing major declines in marine ecosystems.

					<p>The fast depletion of fish in the waters of the Solomon Islands is a growing concern that contributes to malnutrition and chronic poverty, according to a marine researcher from Australia John Fairfax. Mr Fairfax said empirical evidence of serious and general fish depletion and fish barter trade collapse can be easily found. It has been modern nations that have taken away so much fish and overloaded the Pacific food ecosystem with sewage nutrient pollution from billions of people. Consequences of inaction are immeasurable and already impact world food sustainability and security. (Source: SolomonStar, 3 June 2010)</p>

					<p>A five-day conference on fish conservation was held at United Nations Headquarters in New York on 24-29 May 2010, amid warnings that three quarters of the world’s fish stocks are in distress and nearing depletion while marine ecosystems continue to deteriorate. The conference reviewed implementation of the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement that established a legal regime for long-term conservation and sustainable use of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks. It provided an opportunity for countries to consider new measures to tighten implementation of the legal regime. Participants focused on how to bolster the region’s commitment to ratify the protocol concerning pollution from land-based sources and Activities, or the LBS Protocol. So far, only six countries – Panama, Belize, Saint Lucia, France, the United States and Trinidad and Tobago – have ratified the LBS Protocol.
