						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Closing fishing areas and regulating the use of fishing gear can result in more profitable catches that boost fishermen's incomes, according to a study. The conclusion has emerged from a long-term investigation in Kenya on the effects of fishery closures on fishermen's profits. The study, published in <i>Conservation Biology</i>, used data on 27,000 fish caught in three locations off the Kenyan coast over a period of 12 years. The study was unusual because it differentiated the effects of fishery closures from those of other initiatives. (Source: SciDev, 21 May 2010) </p>

					<p>Already under threat from over-fishing, habitat loss and weak management, fisheries and aquaculture are in a poor position to cope with the effects of climate change. Rising sea temperatures are predicted to drive most marine species towards the poles - increasing the populations of warmer-water species and decreasing populations of colder-water species. For example, fish adapted to narrow temperature ranges, such as Atlantic salmon, &quot;may be extirpated from their present habitats because of the combined impacts of warming, changing habitats, introduced competitors and predators and increased parasitism,&quot; the study found.

					<p>A landmark treaty that aims to shut down ports to illegal fishing vessels has been approved by the FAO. This will be the first ever legally-binding global pact that commits governments to prevent, deter and eventually eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing by taking steps to guard their ports against ships engaged in such illicit practices and consequently preventing their catch from entering international markets. Eleven FAO members – Angola, Brazil, Chile, the EC, Indonesia, Iceland, Norway, Samoa, Sierra Leone, the United States and Uruguay – signed the treaty immediately following its approval by the agency’s Governing Conference. IUU fishing damages the productivity of fisheries and could lead to their collapse, FAO warned. Operating without proper authorization, catching protected species, using outlawed types of gear or disregarding catch quotas are among the most common unlawful activities.

	Scientists working on the EU-funded CARBOOCEAN (“Marine carbon sources and sinks assessment”) project have reiterated calls for a greater reduction of man-made CO2 emissions. Current targets are not strict enough, they argue, as contrary to popular belief, their findings show how the regional carbon sinks in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean that take up more CO2 than they release are not stable and have decreased in nearly a decade. Higher atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations will accelerate ocean acidification and diminish the effectiveness of marine carbon sink areas. The CARBOOCEAN project, supported under the 'Sustainable development, global change and ecosystems' Thematic area of the EU's FP6, reveals that finding and quantifying the CO2 in the oceans, and understanding how it got there is key. The project finds that overestimating the ocean's ability to act as a sink can be vital when policy is under development. In the same way that medicine needs a diagnosis and prognosis, so must the ocean's ability to absorb CO2, according to the project partners. Observations need to be made, and all realistic prognostic climate simulations are dependent upon a correct quantification of the ocean's ability to act as a sink for CO2. Central to this is determining the role the ocean plays in CO2 uptake and in sink formation. By identifying the role, researchers could develop realistic climate simulations in the future.

					<p>Fish populations in the tropics could fall by as much as 40% over the next half century because of global warming, jeopardising a vital food source for the developing world, a new study published in the Global Change Biology journal has found. The waters off Indonesia - which rank among the most plentiful areas for fish today - could see supplies fall by well over 20% by 2055 because of changes in ocean conditions. Fishermen operating in US coastal waters (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) could also face large declines in fish stocks, as would those working off Chile and China. However, not all regions would be losers. Cooler climates would see their catch potential rise by between 30% and 70% by 2055, with Norway, Greenland, Alaska and the east coast of Russia seeing the biggest increases. While the overall productivity of the world's oceans will remain roughly the same, the sharp declines in fish stocks in Asia, the Caribbean, and semi-enclosed seas like the Mediterranean could cause severe shortfalls in some of the poorest regions of the world.

					<p>The Agricultural Society of Trinidad and Tobago (ASTT) has launched a project in Cedros to rear tilapia. It is being done in collaboration with Point Coco Agricultural Corporation in an effort towards developing aquacultural projects to ensure a food-stable nation. The project was started in April of this year, when the members of ASTT began to rear the Silver Nile tilapia in raised concrete tanks. Executive board member of the ASTT Jensen Alexander said the ASTT had assembled packages for farmers to encourage tilapia farming and that funding would be provided for interested parties to jump-start the production of a local food source. President of ASTT Dhano Sookoo said the tilapia project is one of the many projects that the ASTT had developed for the expansion of local agriculture.

A little-known EU regulation coming into force in January next year could have a major impact on the health of fishing industries in developing countries. The EU is the single largest consumer of fish in the world, accounting for around 40 per cent of global imports. Such is the continent’s appetite for aquatic life; the cumulative net fish exports from developing countries now exceed earnings from coffee, bananas and rubber.But near-unfettered access to the European market for developing countries is set to end with the adoption of new legislation to help eradicate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing practices and ensure the sustainability of worldwide fish stocks.

	Experts warn that the world's growing population is depleting the world's wild fish stocks. The FAO says 70 percent of all the worlds' fisheries are barely able to replenish themselves at current catch rates. Cliff Goudey of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Offshore Aquaculture Engineering Center is developing a solution by building fish cages that can move under their own power. In future, giant, autonomous cages may whir as fish farms through the open ocean, mimicking the movements of wild schools or even allowing fish to forage ‘free range’ before capturing them once again. This technology gives fish farmers a way to rotate cage locations without towing cages behind boats.</p>

					<p>A killer disease is decimating fish stocks in the Zambezi River Valley, threatening the food security and livelihoods of rural populations in an area shared by seven countries, FAO warned on July 21 2009. An alert issued by FAO’s Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS) said the disease, known as Epizootic Ulcerative Syndrome, or EUS, is caused by the fungus Aphanomyces invadans, which forms ugly lesions on fish and has a high rate of mortality. It is one of the most serious aquatic diseases affecting finfish. “If not properly contained there is the risk of the disease spreading to other countries surrounding the Zambezi River as well as river systems in the region,” said Rohana Subasinghe, Senior Fishery Resources Officer. The 1,390,000 km² Zambezi River Basin is home to some 32 million people, of whom 80 percent are dependent on agriculture or fishing and fish farming. (Source: FAO, 21 July 2009)</p>

In a <a href="ftp://ftp.fao.org/FI/brochure/climate_change/policy_brief.pdf" target="_blank">policy brief</a> issued on the first of June 2009 in advance of UNFCC talks held from 1 to 12 June 2009 in Bonn, Germany, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the World Bank, the WorldFish Center and 11 other organizations warned that millions of fishers, fish farmers and coastal inhabitants will experience less stable livelihoods, changes in the availability and quality of fish for food, and heightened risks to their health, safety and homes as a result of climate change. Research is required to understand the complex biological and chemical processes of aquatic ecosystems. Equally important is understanding how people adapt to living in a changing climate and how their institutions and livelihoods have evolved, and can further evolve, to maintain resilience in the face of future change.

					<p>The battering taken by Caribbean coral reefs is finally taking its toll on the fish that dwell in them, a large new study suggests. &quot;We are seeing striking declines that are amazingly consistent across a huge area and very different types of fish,&quot; says Michelle Paddack of Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada. Paddack's team reanalysed 48 studies that had taken place in 318 reefs since 1955 and found that after decades of stability, fish numbers have started to go down. Starting from the mid 1990s, in all regions covered by the studies, fish numbers have fallen by between 2.7 and 6% per year. Paddack suspects that as well as overfishing, coral demise from disease and bleaching is to blame, together with pollution from coastal development. (Source: New Scientist, 19 March 2009)</p>

	“With climate change threatening to alter habitats in the region, it is even more critical to manage marine ecosystems for the ongoing food security of the region and for the survival of many species that depend on the Coral Triangle’s unique marine environment,” said Dr Pet Soede. The Coral Triangle is the most diverse marine region on the planet, matched in its importance to life on Earth only by the Amazon rainforest and the Congo basin. Defined by marine areas containing more than 500 species of reef-building coral, it covers 5.4 million square kilometers of ocean across six countries in the Indo-Pacific – Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Solomon Islands, and Timor-Leste. World Wide Fund (WWF) is urging tuna fishing nations in the Asia Pacific to use the region’s essential ecosystem services to negotiate better prices and fairer fishing arrangements with foreign fishing nations.

					<p>The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), has called for a comprehensive management of fisheries, saying that Overfishing, bycatch and discards need to be urgently addressed. According to the Chief of the FAO Fishing Technology Service, Jeremy Turner, reducing fishing capacity and limiting access to shrimp fisheries, is likely to mitigate overfishing, bycatch and seabed destruction, some of the major economic and environmental side-effects of shrimp fishing. Turner said the global study of shrimp fisheries reviews current problems and solutions of shrimp fishing in ten selected countries which includes Nigeria, Australia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Kuwait, Madagascar, Mexico, Norway, Trinidad and Tobago and the United States.

					<p>Eight countries - four in Africa and four in Asia - have been identified as those most economically vulnerable to the effects of climate change on fisheries in the first ever detailed study of the subject. The most badly hit countries are those where fish play a large role in diet, income and trade, and also lack the capacity to adapt to the impact of climate change such as the loss of coral reef habitats to the bleaching effect of warmer waters, and lakes parched by an increase in heat and a decrease in rainfall.
