						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Saying that vulnerable fishing and coastal communities around the world will bear the brunt of climate change's impacts, a group of 16 international organizations have urged climate negotiators to ensure that fisheries and aquaculture are not neglected in ongoing discussions regarding a successor to the Kyoto Protocol. In a <a href="ftp://ftp.fao.org/FI/brochure/climate_change/policy_brief.pdf" target="_blank">policy brief</a> issued on the first of June 2009 in advance of UNFCC talks held from 1 to 12 June 2009 in Bonn, Germany, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the World Bank, the WorldFish Center and 11 other organizations warned that millions of fishers, fish farmers and coastal inhabitants will experience less stable livelihoods, changes in the availability and quality of fish for food, and heightened risks to their health, safety and homes as a result of climate change. Research is required to understand the complex biological and chemical processes of aquatic ecosystems. Equally important is understanding how people adapt to living in a changing climate and how their institutions and livelihoods have evolved, and can further evolve, to maintain resilience in the face of future change.

					<p>The battering taken by Caribbean coral reefs is finally taking its toll on the fish that dwell in them, a large new study suggests. &quot;We are seeing striking declines that are amazingly consistent across a huge area and very different types of fish,&quot; says Michelle Paddack of Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada. Paddack's team reanalysed 48 studies that had taken place in 318 reefs since 1955 and found that after decades of stability, fish numbers have started to go down. Starting from the mid 1990s, in all regions covered by the studies, fish numbers have fallen by between 2.7 and 6% per year. Paddack suspects that as well as overfishing, coral demise from disease and bleaching is to blame, together with pollution from coastal development. (Source: New Scientist, 19 March 2009)</p>

					<p>The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), has called for a comprehensive management of fisheries, saying that Overfishing, bycatch and discards need to be urgently addressed. According to the Chief of the FAO Fishing Technology Service, Jeremy Turner, reducing fishing capacity and limiting access to shrimp fisheries, is likely to mitigate overfishing, bycatch and seabed destruction, some of the major economic and environmental side-effects of shrimp fishing. Turner said the global study of shrimp fisheries reviews current problems and solutions of shrimp fishing in ten selected countries which includes Nigeria, Australia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Kuwait, Madagascar, Mexico, Norway, Trinidad and Tobago and the United States.

					<p>Human beings no longer thrive under the water from which their ancestors emerged, but their relationship with the sea remains close. Over half the world’s people live within 100 kilometres (62 miles) of the coast; a tenth are within 10km. On land at least, the sea delights the senses and excites the imagination. The sight and smell of the sea inspire courage and adventure, fear and romance. Though the waves may be rippling or mountainous, the waters angry or calm, the ocean itself is eternal. Its moods pass. Its tides keep to a rhythm. It is unchanging. Or so it has long seemed. Appearances deceive, though. Large parts of the sea may indeed remain unchanged, but in others, especially in the surface and coastal waters where 90% of marine life is to be found, the impact of man’s activities is increasingly plain.

Large quantities of illegally traded unprocessed fish, especially Nile perch and tilapia, may be finding their way to export markets in the European Union (EU).

					<p>Fisheries researchers have successfully bred three fish species in captivity, which are threatened by extinction in local lakes and rivers. The fish, labeo victorianus, commonly called ningu, barbus altianaris (kisinja) and the male African cat fish are threatened by extinction because of water pollution by factories, farming along the shores and capturing of immature fish. The introduction of exotic fish species like the Nile Perch, which is a predator, also threatened their existence. &quot;The ningu and kisinja breed in fast-flowing waters. During the rainy season, they tend to move to swamps to breed,&quot; said Godfrey Kityo, a researcher at the National Fisheries Resources Research Institute. However, fishermen lay traps, capturing the fish before they lay eggs (New Vision, 23 September 2008).</p>

					<p>After two years of preparation and negotiation, FAO Members have adopted international guidelines aimed at limiting the impact of fishing on fragile deep sea fish species and habitats. The guidelines provide a framework that fishing nations should use when operating in high-seas areas outside of national jurisdictions, where many deep sea fisheries (DSF) are located. Stating that all fishing activity in deep sea areas should be “rigorously managed,” they lay out measures to be taken to identify and protect vulnerable ecosystems and provide guidance on the sustainable use of marine living resources in deep-sea areas (Source: FAO, 3 September 2008).</p>

					<p>Madagascar is entering uncharted waters in its bid to implement ambitious projects in partnership with poor local communities that will more than triple existing conservation areas. The Indian Ocean island is renowned for its unique and abundant terrestrial biodiversity, but its marine environment, which includes extensive coral reefs, mangroves and sea grass beds, has remained relatively unknown.

					<p>Temperature and other variations resulting from climate change will have a strong impact on fisheries and aquaculture, with significant food security consequences for certain populations, FAO said this week. The UN food agency’s note of caution came at the start of a four day scientific symposium on climate change and marine fisheries being held at its Rome headquarters (8-11 July 2008). The event, which involves over 200 experts and policymakers from around the globe, aims to paint a fuller picture of the challenges that climate change poses to marine fisheries and the millions of people who depend on them for food and income. FAO also noted however that the impacts of climate-related physical and biological changes in fisheries on the communities that depend on them will be as varied as the changes themselves. Both negative and positive impacts are likely, depending on local circumstances and the vulnerability and adaptive capacity of the affected communities (Source: FAO Newsroom, 10 July 2008).</p>

					<p>Media attention to mislabelled seafood is helping bring the scale of illegal and unregulated fishing to consumers' attention. Bangor University and University of Salford scientists explain how genetic tools can promote sustainability and make sure the fish we buy is what it says on the label. The author also look at so-called IUU fishing (illegal, unreported and unregulated), which is not included in stock assessment and examine the consequence of unidentifiable marketed fish (that leads to fraud or mislabelling). The illegal substitution of one species for another is best tackled by a method known as 'COI barcoding', a process that works by analysing the 600 base-pair sequence of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase I gene. DNA results from fish samples can be matched against the Barcode of Life Data system (www.boldsystems.org) which currently contains the DNA sequences of nearly a third of known fish species. The method is cost-effective and reliable. Virtually any product advertised or sold as a particular species, anywhere in the world, can be verified unequivocally using a COI barcoding test.

					<p>Six populations of fish returned to healthy levels in 2011, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported early May. NOAA’s Fisheries Service said the count showed that controversial and often unpopular catch limits imposed by the government have been working. Among the rebuilt populations are the Bering Sea snow crab, the summer flounder on the mid-Atlantic coast, the haddock in the Gulf of Maine, the Chinook salmon along the Northern California coast, the coho salmon off Washington State and the Pacific widow rockfish. NOAA must report annually on the state of fish stocks in waters within 200 miles of the coast, and depleted stocks must be rebuilt to healthy levels. Scores of fish species have been in serious decline since the 1980s, largely because of overfishing. Altogether, 27 fish stocks have been returned to health in the last 11 years, the agency said. The recovery is proof that catch limits and stocks monitoring can tone down overfishing and help replenish fish populations.

					<p>EU Scientists warn that European restrictions on personal data endanger marine research and sustainability. A little-noticed tweak to one of the EU’s many rules and regulations is leaving fisheries scientists struggling to access vital data. The rule change means that raw data from devices used to monitor fishing vessels are no longer available to some scientists. This information is vital for proper, scientifically based management of Europe’s troubled fish stocks. At the heart of the problem is information from devices called Vessel Monitoring Systems, which are attached to many fishing boats to record their position, direction and speed. From these data, the boats' fishing patterns can be reconstructed, allowing researchers to assess fishing activity and, for example, examine the environmental impact on specific areas. In 2009 a new EC rule was brought in, restricting who could access what data within the EU. This rule took some time to filter through but it is now becoming apparent that the very detailed fisheries data needed by some academics are no longer available.

The Nile tilapia was imported into the Philippines in the early 1970s but after some initial success and popularity became inbred and yields declined. A ten year multi-national effort for genetic improvement led to the development of the hugely successful GIFT strain (Genetically Improved Farmed Tilapia). The ultimate aim of the study is to identify superior strains of Nile tilapia for aquaculture, when at least four strains will be assessed.

					<p>Scientists at the University of Liverpool, UK are developing a new plant-based product that could replace fishmeal, reducing the need for farmers to feed fish to other fish at a time when more than 90% of EU waters are at risk from overfishing. Currently farmed fish, such as salmon, are fed food containing fishmeal, which means that several kilograms of wild fish are consumed to produce one kilogram of farmed fish. To help sustain fish stocks, the aquaculture industry is working towards replacing fishmeal with plant proteins, such as soya. The difficulty with this approach, however, is that many plants contain anti-nutrients that prevent digestive enzymes from working, resulting in poor digestion and failure to absorb important nutrients. Researchers are now leading a consortium to resolve this issue by fermenting plant protein sources, which will use ‘good bacteria’ to predigest food and make nutrients more available for absorption in the gut.
