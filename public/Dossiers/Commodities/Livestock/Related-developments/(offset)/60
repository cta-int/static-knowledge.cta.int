						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>A new research programme of € 15 million was launched on 15 February 2010 to find sustainable solutions to the animal diseases that threaten food security and help to build scientific capacity in the developing world to meet future challenges in this field. Under this programme, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and the Department for International Development (DFID), with a contribution from the Scottish Government, have joined forces to fund 16 new projects that bring together world-class UK researchers with institutions in the developing world.

					<p>Recent studies of East Coast fever have shown that the so-called ‘protective’ proteins of the causative parasite—that is, the antigenic molecules that are recognized by the T lymphocytes of the bovine immune system and thus help animals fight development of disease—vary among the different strains of the parasite that exist in the field. This project will build on these advances to investigate the nature and extent of variability in these antigens between parasite strains. This knowledge will help scientists understand the factors that determine which parasite strains induce protective immune responses in animals that have been vaccinated. Results of the project should provide methods for maintaining high quality of the current live vaccine and identifying parasite strains that could be incorporated into an improved second-generation live vaccine.

					<p>Africa's livestock producers are proving resilient to climate change and generating huge economic benefits for their nations and regions, researchers said in a book published on the 31th of January by the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) and SOS Sahel. The book shows how pastoralism is a major economic player and contributor to many African economies and one whose importance is only set to grow as climate change takes hold. The book shows how livestock play a key role in the economic prosperity in African's drylands by supporting hundreds of millions of people, and a massive meat and leather industry. 'What is remarkable is that these benefits all arise from animals fed solely on natural pasture,' said Ced Hesse, a researcher at IIED and one of the book's authors.

					<p><b>Global Animal Production </b>is facing significant challenges over the next few decades if it is to meet the increasing demand for protein from a growing world population given the threat of climatic change and changing social expectations. In the Tropics these challenges are even larger as this is where high population growth is often combined with a rising demand for livestock products. Scientists, farmers and policymakers need to work together to identify innovative solutions. Opportunities exist in 3 key areas: - animal breeding, - feed and forage resources, - farming systems that match territory and global markets. 
From <b>November</b> <b>15 to 18, 2010</b> the SAPT2010 Conference will hold 3 sessions on the following subjects: 
1) Adaptation capacities of livestock to a changing environment 
2) Local feeds their value and strategic use 3) Sustainable and integrated livestock farming systems. 
Centering on tropical and subtropical humid areas, world renowned experts will present talks on their research results in these different fields. Conference participants will be able to share knowledge and good practice, identify relevant solutions and fix priorities to meet livestock challenges. Gaps in scientific knowledge will also be identified to highlight future research needs.
Submitted Papers : A 1-page summary that would fit in one of the 3 sessions is welcome. <b>The deadline is May 15, 2010.</b> Proposals will be reviewed by the Scientific Committee and chosen for either a plenary oral, short presentation or poster. A special poster discussion session will be held at the end of each session.

					<p>Thousands of herders in arid areas of northern Kenya will soon be able to buy livestock insurance, based on a first-of-its-kind program in Africa. The program was announced on January 22 in northern Kenya’s Marsabit District by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), microfinance pioneer Equity Bank and African insurance provider UAP Insurance Ltd. Insuring the livestock of pastoralist families has long been considered impossible because of the difficulty of verifying deaths of animals, which move over vast tracts of land in search of food. ILRI and its partners have overcome this impediment by combining the use of satellite images of vegetation with monthly surveys of livestock deaths to pinpoint the level of forage reduction that will cause animals to die.

	Scientists baffled by the continued spread of sleeping sickness through Uganda have discovered that it is livestock markets that are driving the disease. A team from Uganda and the United Kingdom analysed the incidence of the serious Rhodesian form of sleeping sickness, which is carried by cattle, in two newly affected districts. The team looked at nearly 700 villages in the two districts. The research shows that livestock markets are a major risk to disease control. The scientists calculated the vulnerability of a village to sleeping sickness by mapping how close it was to various risk factors such as areas where tsetse flies — which transmit the disease — are likely to live. The research was published in <a href="http://www.plosntds.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0000563" target="_blank">PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</a> (Source: All Africa, 22 January 2010)</p>

					<p>Rinderpest, one of the deadliest cattle diseases, is set to become the first animal disease to be eradicated from the planet. The FAO announced November 30th that it expects, along with the World Organisation for Animal Health and other partners, to declare the disease wiped out in the next 18 months. Cattle plague, as rinderpest is also known, has killed millions of cows and other hoofed animals. It is caused by a virus and spreads through contact, and by water and food contaminated with the dung of infected animals. The disease can kill all infected animals in an outbreak, losing farmers money and food. (Source: SciDev.net, December 9, 2009)</p>

					<p>Livestock researchers believe that rather than rid the world of livestock it’s preferable to find ways to farm animals more efficiently, profitably and sustainably, according to a new short film (see article) prepared by the ILRI on livestock and climate change. “Looking at the livestock emissions as a whole, if you aggregate that into one, you are missing a big difference between developing and developed countries,” says ILRI director general Carlos Sere in the film. “In developed economies, which mainly have a commercial livestock sector, we can apply a range of policies and instruments to reduce emissions. Reducing livestock-related greenhouse gas emissions in poor countries is possible, but we need to be aware of the stark trade-offs. We might end up with many more poor people and hungry children.”(Source: CGIAR, December 9, 2009)</p>

					<p>
The stresses of climate-induced crop failures could be avoided if more small farmers in Africa also raised livestock, say researchers. Climate change will result in a 10-20% drop in yield for crops such as beans, maize and millet in Africa's drylands by 2050, researchers from the Kenya-based International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) and the United Kingdom's Waen Associates found. But many farmers in some of the affected areas could keep livestock to increase their incomes and reduce their vulnerability, the researchers say. The researchers warn that the change to livestock farming must be done sustainably, for example by limiting the number of livestock in an area during dry conditions so the pasture can recover quickly when rains come. Mario Herrero, ILRI's systems analyst, acknowledges that an increase in livestock would increase greenhouse gas emissions but says the impact from the alternative - of herders migrating and cutting down forest to grow crops - could be worse.

					<p>An online electronic atlas has been launched by FAO that provides detailed research data and information on global livestock production and health statistics. The Global Livestock Production and Health Atlas (GLiPHA) offers users the unique opportunity to view sub-national statistics relating to the livestock sector, which can be viewed cartographically, against a back-drop of selected maps, such as livestock densities, land-use and topography. Data may also be displayed and exported as tables and charts. The objectives of GLiPHA are to facilitate access to livestock sector information for analysis and informed decision making, and to increase awareness of sector-related social, health and environmental issues. GLiPHA draws on data managed within the Global Livestock Impact Mapping (GLIMS) – a global, sub-national data warehouse containing a multitude of livestock-sector related information.</p>

By Christopher L. Delgado, Clare A. Narrod, and Marites M. Tiongco, IFPRI 2008 
Human population growth, increasing urbanization, and rising incomes have fueled
unprecedented growth in the demand for livestock products in the developing world.This creates pressures on world feedgrain and oilseed markets, but presents opportunities for poor people who rear, process, or market livestock products to enhance their livelihoods. However, large-scale, industrialized forms of poultry, pig, and dairy production are also growing rapidly to compete for these new markets, and poor people may find it increasingly difficult to compete.</p>

					<p>Madagascar is entering uncharted waters in its bid to implement ambitious projects in partnership with poor local communities that will more than triple existing conservation areas. The Indian Ocean island is renowned for its unique and abundant terrestrial biodiversity, but its marine environment, which includes extensive coral reefs, mangroves and sea grass beds, has remained relatively unknown. The plan includes more than tripling the size of Madagascar’s protected areas, from 1.7 million hectares to 6 million hectares, with a focus on marine environments and upgrading the protection of marine resources (Source: IRIN, 1 August 2008). </p>

					<p>Livestock has for long been a major source of food for humanity the world over. But with increased debate on climate change, scientists are beginning to weigh cost-benefit of livestock to the debate as it is a major contributor of the dangerous greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. Land use and agriculture alone contributes to a third of the greenhouse gas emission into the atmospher,where land takes 18% and agriculture 14%. According to a 2006 United Nations initiative, the livestock industry is one of the largest contributors to environmental degradation worldwide and modern practices of raising animals for food contributes on a massive scale to air and water pollution, land degradation, climate change and loss of biodiversity (Source: by Pius Sawa, African Science News Service, 28 June 2008).</p>
