They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>The debate around GM crops in South Africa has flared up once again after the rejection of a permit application for the general release of the <i>SpuntaG2</i>, a potato that is resistant to the <i>Potato Tuber Moth</i> (PTM). While the developers argue that this potato is a blessing to small-scale farmers, who suffer the most from the pest, other organizations reject these claims. To boost both commercial and small-scale agricultural production, the South African government over time has allowed for the introduction of various genetically modified crops, such as maize and soy. The <i>SpuntaG2</i> contains an introduced protein that kills caterpillars of the PTM. It is estimated that this insect contributes to losses of up to U.S.D 5.2 million a year to the country's potato industry. Although a permit application for the general release of this modified vegetable has recently been rejected, the developers remain determined to introduce their potato. It is the small-scale farmers, and not the big commercial potato growers, who suffer from the PTM. Most of them cannot afford to spray chemicals in order to protect their crops The <i>SpuntaG2</i> seeds will therefore be no more expensive then seeds of conventional potatoes. There has been much interest from small-scale farmers, both in South Africa and abroad. (Source: AllAfrica, 30 October 2009)</p>

	The term “nightshade” refers collectively to a wide-ranging group of plants, including poisonous, medicinal, and edible species (from the genus Solanum). This includes three major crops of global importance: tomato, potato, and eggplant. The broad-leafed African nightshade (Solanum scabrum) is widely cultivated in sub-Saharan Africa on smallholder plots and in home gardens around cities. African nightshade is sometimes referred to as black nightshade or garden huckleberry. The vegetable is an excellent source of protein, iron, vitamin A, iodine, zinc. Nightshades are traditionally used worldwide as medicinal plants, especially to treat stomach ailments. Leaf extracts from African nightshade are used to treat diarrhea, eye infections, and jaundice. The raw fruit is sometimes chewed to treat stomach ulcers or stomachache. There are no solid statistics on how much African nightshade is currently cultivated. But the crop is one of the most important indigenous leafy vegetables in West and Central Africa, and to a lesser extent East Africa, according to Plant Resources of Tropical Africa (PROTA). Cameroon produces enough African nightshade to export to neighboring countries. According to Patrick Maundu at Bioversity International, demand for the crop has recently risen significantly since East African supermarkets started stocking it. In September of 2010, Kenyan Professor Mary Onyango-Abukutsa—who is quoted in ‘State of the World 2011: Innovations that Nourish the Planet’ - was awarded a grant by Kenya’s National Council for Science and Technology to lead research on African indigenous vegetables at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology. Her research will focus on three key vegetables: African nightshade, spider plant, and amaranth. Professor Mary Onyango-Abukutsa was the first place winner of the 2008/2009 Africa-wide Women in Science Competitions that was organized by CTA in collaboration with several partners.(source: Worldwatch Institute, 7 Feb. 2011)</p>

					<p>World Watch Institute's 'Nourishing the Planet' project describes another little known food crop with an untapped potential for securing food security. Giant swamp taro (<i>Cyrtosperma chamissonis</i>) is more abundant on Pacific atolls than its cousin, the taro (<i>Colocasia esculenta</i>), but it is much less commercially available. Its traditional cultivation is labour intensive and dependent upon a consistently saturated environment, which makes it practical to grow only in small, marshy plots. Swamp taro is a native plant of the Philippines that has dozens of varieties thriving on most of the tropical islands in the Pacific. Giant swamp taro is grown and harvested in small patches for its underground tubers, called corms. Atoll farmers often grow giant swamp taro as part of complex polycultures, in the shade of larger trees. Researchers consider the potential of giant swamp taro to be largely untapped, partly because it is not often studied by researchers and techniques for improving the plant's cultivation have not been developed.

					<p>Lettuce growers could safely reduce the amount of irrigation water used on their fields by 25 %, so say researchers working on an ongoing EU-funded project into how climate change and globalisation affect the production of fresh produce. The findings of the Veg-i-Trade ('Impact of climate change and globalisation on safety of fresh produce governing a supply chain of uncompromised food sovereignty') project, coordinated by Mieke Uyttendaele from Ghent University in Belgium, show that using less water also helps increase the shelf life of fresh-cut lettuce, reduces farming costs and improves sustainability. One of the Veg-i-Trade partners has investigated the influence of different irrigation water doses on the quality and safety characteristics of two different types of fresh-cut lettuce: Romaine and Iceberg. The results show that using 25% less irrigation water prolongs the lettuce's shelf life, decreases browning on the cut edge of lettuce pieces and preserves microbiological quality.(<a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=EN_NEWS&amp;ACTION=D&amp;DOC=4&amp;CAT=NEWS&amp;QUERY=01389ecc7882:82e7:262c29c6&amp;RCN=34811%20" target="_blank">CORDIS</a>, 9/7/2012)</p>

					<p>A team of international scientists has successfully decoded the DNA of the potato blight pathogen. Spread by spores, <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>, or potato blight, is a form of water mould that can ruin crops in just a few days, and causes losses of about US$6 billion each year. The research, published in the journal Nature, discovered that the genome of the organism is between two and four times the size of closely related species and contains areas of repeated DNA sequences which enable fast mutation. These stretches of code are the key to plant infection, changing so rapidly that the host can't fight back. This explains how the pathogen is able to attack new varieties of potato that have been genetically bred to resist the infection. Scientists hope that with a better understanding of the genome it will now be easier to breed new blight resistant potato varieties and develop more effective treatments.

FAO has launched a quick reference calendar covering 43 major African countries that advises which crops to plant when, according to the type of agricultural zone from drylands to highlands. The web-based tool, developed by FAO experts, covers more than 130 crops from beans to beetroot to wheat to watermelon. It is aimed at all donors, agencies, government extension workers and non-governmental organizations working with farmers on the continent. There are 283 agro-ecological zones covered in the calendar, representing the vast richness and variety of the African ecology as well as challenges of land degradation, sand encroachment and floods.(Source : FAO, 11 November 2010)</p>

					<p>Much of the worlds’ annual harvest loss to pests and diseases occurs as a consequence of crops grown in monocultures, or cultivated varieties with uniform resistance. This uniform resistance is met by the continuing evolution of new races of pests and pathogens that are able to overcome resistance genes introduced by modern breeding, creating the phenomenon of boom and bust cycles. One of the few assets available to small-scale farmers in developing countries to reduce pests and diseases damage is their local crop varietal diversity, together with the knowledge to manage and deploy this diversity appropriately. By performing cross-site on-farm experiments, it was possible to identify traditional varieties with higher resistance to pest and diseases when grown outside their home sites. Increased diversity of crop varieties, measured by number of varieties (richness) and their evenness of distribution, corresponded to a decrease in the average damage levels across sites and to a reduction of variance of disease damage. In sites with higher disease incidence, households with higher levels of diversity in their production systems had less damage to their standing crop in the field compared to sites with lower disease incidence. The results support what might be expected of a risk-minimizing strategy for use of diversity to reduce pest and disease damage.

The findings suggest that: fodder legume use in Africa was based on local experience and traditional practices; the development of fodder grasses has been a more important research theme in Africa in the past 100 years than the development of fodder legumes; there is no strong evidence that the agricultural revolution in Europe was a major contributing factor to attempts aimed at promoting fodder legumes in Africa; using appropriate methodology, national and international fodder researchers have developed some successful fodder grasses and legumes in Africa, especially for &quot;crop&quot; and &quot;niche&quot; roles; and, there are at least 3 well-documented examples of successful promotion of fodder legumes in African mixed (crop + livestock) farming systems. For the past 10 years, systems-based approaches to fodder legume research have had an increasing impact on productivity in and policy for African mixed farming systems.

					<p>Improvements in vegetable production, transport and marketing are important to the well being of small holder farmers in Papua New Guinea, and opportunities for strengthening the industry and enhancing performance can be achieved by use of value chain analysis. A project on ‘Increasing Vegetable Production in Central Province, Papua New Guinea to Supply Port Moresby Markets’ funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) and led by the Tasmanian Institute of Agricultural Research is identifying and addressing vegetable supply chain priorities in Central Province of PNG. It aims to provide small farmer communities with production options and marketing skills so they can take advantage of the opportunity to improve their socioeconomic position in a sustainable manner in an economy that is expanding due to mineral and gas development projects. An integral part of the project was a value chain workshop for the stakeholders held at Pacific Advent University, Port Moresby. The value chain workshop was designed to assist stakeholders to develop skills to improve the performance of the value chain through enhancing relationships among the chain participants (or actors) – farmers, transporters, wholesalers and consumers. The ultimate aim is the development of viable, functional value chains that provide satisfactory returns to all participants in them.(<a href="http://www.agriculturesnetwork.org/resources/extra/local-vegetable-production-png" target="_blank">AgriCultures Network</a>, 2012)</p>

					<p>This resource is being developed by the project ‘Adapting agriculture to climate change: collecting, protecting and preparing crop wild relatives’. This Project is led by the Global Crop Diversity Trust and the Millennium Seed Bank of the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, UK, and is supported by the Government of Norway. It is being implemented through partnerships with national and international crop conservation and use programmes, universities and other research institutions, and in accordance with the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. Many individual scientists, herbaria, genebanks and specialist institutes are contributing advice and information to the Project and this website. The Project aims to collect the wild relatives of 26 key crops, conserve them in genebanks, and prepare them for use in plant breeding programmes in time to breed new crop varieties adapted to new climates.<a href="http://www.cwrdiversity.org/" target="_self">http://www.cwrdiversity.org/</a></p>
