						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

Summary of FAO e-conference, 5 March – 1 April 2007The FAO has released a summary of its e-mail conference, which discussed the application of biotechnology for the development of crops with improved drought resistance or water use efficiency. Most discussion on this topic was dedicated to marker-assisted selection and genetic modification. The two other main issues discussed were how to deliver real solutions to farmers and the role of the CGIAR. 78 emails were contributed during the four-week conference, about 70% of which were from individuals working at universities and at national or international research organizations.  </p>

Kristin Davis et al., Discussion Paper 736, IFPRI, December 2007This paper examines the role of postsecondary agricultural education and training (AET) in sub-Saharan Africa in the context of the region's agricultural innovation systems. Specifically, the paper looks at how AET in sub-Saharan Africa can contribute to agricultural development by strengthening innovative capabilities, or the ability to introduce new products and processes that are socially or economically relevant to smallholder farmers and other agents in the agricultural sector. Using AET in Ethiopia and Mozambique as case studies, the paper argues that while AET is conventionally viewed in terms of its role in building human and scientific capital, it also has a vital role to play in building the capacity of organizations and individuals to transmit and adapt new applications of existing information, new products and processes, and new organizational cultures and behaviors. The paper emphasizes the importance of improving AET systems by strengthening the innovative capabilities of AET organizations and professionals; changing organizational cultures, behaviors, and incentives; and building innovation networks and linkages.  </p>

					<p> 
Xinshen Diao, Paul Dorosh, and Shaikh Mahfuzur Rahman, Research Report 154, IFPRI, November 2007How can East and Southern African nations reduce poverty and hunger through agricultural growth? How can they create sufficient market demand to power such growth? This report proposes answers to these questions, applying a general equilibrium framework to the experiences of Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The authors conclude that, for countries like these, promoting traditional agricultural exports, developing non-traditional exports, and increasing food staple growth will probably not be sufficient to generate a significant level of economic growth. Instead, the model simulations suggest that reductions in marketing costs through improved infrastructure and development of market institutions, along with significant growth in the non-agricultural economy (besides that generated by agricultural growth linkages) are necessary conditions for rapid economic growth. This report's findings are a valuable first step toward understanding how East and Southern African nations can achieve economy-wide growth and poverty reduction. </p>

M. Smale and W.K. Tushemereirwe (eds) Research Report 155, IFPRI, December 2007This report assesses the impact on smallholder farmers of technology options developed by Uganda's National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) to improve the productivity of the East African highland banana, a major crop in Uganda and Tanzania. The contributors survey an array of options either currently practiced or under development, including improved soil fertility management practices, conventional banana improvement, and transgenic banana cultivars. Their survey produces a number of findings with important implications for banana production: a recently developed banana hybrid adopted in Tanzania reduced the vulnerability of Tanzanian households to yield losses from pests and disease; a strong network of social ties among farmers facilitates the spread of best soil fertility management practices through farmer-to-farmer exchange; and transgenic bananas currently being developed could have pro-poor impact. Drawing on simulations of the economic benefits of these and other technology options, the contributors conclude that the current strategy endorsed by NARO, of combining conventional and transgenic approaches to mitigate the biotic pressures that cause major economic losses, is essential for sustaining banana production systems. The report serves as a valuable baseline for researchers and others interested in measuring the effectiveness of crop improvement programs. </p>

Rebecca Holmes and Rachel Slater, ODI Opinion 91, Overseas Development Institute, December 2007More than two decades separate two major World Development Reports on rural agriculture: 1982’s report on ‘Agriculture and Economic Development’ and the 2008 report ‘Agriculture for Development’. During this time, there has not only been a marked shift in the way in which the agricultural sector has been addressed within international policy, but there have been radical changes in the way that women’s roles in development, particularly in rural development and agriculture, have been perceived, analysed and addressed. This briefing addresses the barriers that women face in agriculture. The authors provide evidence that greater gender equality is likely to increase efficiency and productivity in the agricultural sector.  </p>

					<p> This report is about the role of biotechnology in the transformation of African economies. The implications of its recommendations, however, need to be seen beyond the confines of biological innovations. They address critical issues related to Africa's place in a globalizing economy. Undertaken at the request of heads of state and government this report demonstrates what is needed to build the required capacity to harness and apply biotechnologies to improve agricultural productivity, public health, industrial development, economic competitiveness, and environmental sustainability (including biodiversity conservation) in Africa. It also shows that the measures needed to address biotechnology will strengthen Africa's capacity to adapt other technologies to economic development. In fact, previous inabilities to build capacity in fields such as information technology hamper the continent's efforts in biotechnology. This report has placed these systemic considerations in the context of the role of innovation in economic transformation. It challenges Africa's heads of state and government to take seriously the importance of a coordinated approach in promoting technological innovation in development.

					<p> The invention of agriculture that occurred around 10,000 years ago heralded a shift from nomadic hunting and gathering to more managed forms of food, feed and fiber production. Since then, agricultural innovation and research has produced great results in feeding the earth's population. This report looks at the changing context of agricultural research and development (R&amp;D), including the economic realities of agricultural R&amp;D; changing incentives to innovate; collective action in R&amp;D, and financing of R&amp;D. The report also looks at the state of sciences for agriculture as well as technological distance, spillovers, and knowledge stocks. The final section of the paper deals with technological risk and how to regulate technology in the agricultural sector. (Source: P. Pardey et al., Working Paper 41371, World Bank, 2007)</p>

					<p> 
Biofuels have been championed as an energy source that can increase security of supply, reduce vehicle emissions and provide a new income stream for farmers. These claims are contested, however. Critics assert that biofuels will increase energy-price volatility, food prices and even life-cycle emissions of greenhouse gases. This paper presents salient facts and figures to shed light on these controversial issues and asks whether biofuels offer a cure that is worse than the disease they seek to heal. The paper discusses two fundamental questions: 1. Do the technical means exist to produce biofuels in ways that enable the world to meet demand for transportation energy in more secure and less harmful ways, on a meaningful scale and without compromising the ability to feed a growing population? 2. Do current national and international policies that promote the production of biofuels represent the most cost-effective means of using biomass and the best way forward for the transport sector?Source: Richard Doornbosch and Ronald Steenblik, OECD Round Table on Sustainable Development, Paris, September 2007 </p>

					<p> 
Projections suggest that, by the end of the 21st century, climate change could have had substantial impact on agricultural production and thence on the scope for reducing poverty. This paper seeks to trace the likely impacts through changes in the quality of the physical asset base, access to assets, and impacts on grain production and on agricultural growth more generally. At moderate degrees of warming, impacts are likely to be negative in some regions, but positive in others, making it important to understand the possible implications for trade between the regions. The short term impacts of climate change, particularly changes in the frequency and severity of adverse weather events, remain uncertain, but their impacts on many developing countries are likely to be negative. There is likely to be time to make appropriate policy responses to some of the longer-term impacts.Source: Rachel Slater et al., Natural Resource Perspectives 109, Overseas Development Institute, September 2007 </p>

					<p> 
This special issue focuses on biofuels, or agrofuels. The stampede into agrofuels is causing enormous environmental and social damage, precious ecosystems are being destroyed and hundreds of thousands of indigenous and peasant communities are being thrown off their land. Worse lies ahead: the Indian government is committed to planting 14 million hectares of land with jatropha, the Inter-American Development Bank says that Brazil has 120 million hectares available for biofuels, and lobbyists in Europe are speaking of almost 400 million hectares being available for biofuels in 15 African countries. We are talking about expropriation on an unprecedented scale. The conclusion is pretty much the same across the board: the push for agrofuels amounts to nothing less than the re-introduction and re-enforcement of the old colonial plantation economy, redesigned to function under the rules of the modern neoliberal, globalised world. Indigenous farming systems, local communities and the biodiversity they manage have to give way to provide for the increased fuel needs of the modern world.Source: GRAIN, July 2007 </p>

					<p> 
The emerging complex of governance of science, technology and innovation, which is related to the complexity of today’s science and technology system, has major implications for the role of parliaments. This paper provides a general review of the complexity of science and technology governance as well as of the interaction between the activities of parliaments and the fields of science and technology. It looks at the structures and processes of parliaments in dealing with science and technology legislation and scrutiny of government policy. It presents UNESCO’s initiative on inter-parliamentary fora on science and technology and it is part of a large effort in the UNESCO to engage government policy-makers, parliaments, scientists, industry, the media, and representatives of the civil society in an active dialogue for a better governance of science and technology. The paper is also complemented by the Conclusions and Recommendations made by a number of parliamentary science, technology and innovation fora organized by UNESCO , in cooperation with ISESCO and other partners, in the framework of the Organization’s action to advice member states in science and technology legislation.Source: STI Policy Working Paper, Unesco.
