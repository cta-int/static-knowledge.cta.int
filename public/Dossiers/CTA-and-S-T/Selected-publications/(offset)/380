						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Giant clams offer small holders throughout the Indo-Pacific with good prospects for commercial culture to satisfy their increasing dependence on the cash economy. Two species appear promising for an emerging village-based export industry in Solomon Islands. These species are <i>Tridacna crocea</i>, the preferred species for the aquarium market, and <i>T. derasa</i>, the species that has the best potential for the seafood market. In this <a href="http://purl.umn.edu/125108" target="_blank">paper</a> (presented at the 2002 conference of the Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society), a bioeconomic model is used in a normative analysis to explore optimal-management strategies for village farmers producing these clams. The normative study provides a benchmark against which current practices can be evaluated.</p>

					<p>This <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2258e/i2258e00.pdf%20" target="_blank">FAO publication</a> identifies the underlying drivers that allow small-producer organisations to thrive, the good practices enabling development practitioners and other stakeholders to learn from successful local/regional initiatives, to support them and replicate them. The findings are useful for orienting operational programmes to support and empower small-scale producers in a process of sustainable and inclusive development. Indirectly, policy-makers may also draw inspiration from these cases as they demonstrate that, under the right conditions, critical bottlenecks to food security and sustainable rural development can be overcome. This publication on good practices in institutional building suggests that strengthened knowledge and capacities of individuals are central to fortifying rural institutions. The good practices described herein embody a capacity development approach by addressing all three dimensions in fortifying rural organisations’ members with skills and information (individual dimension), in improving processes and procedures within organisations and linkages between organisations (organisational dimension) and by addressing issues of the enabling environment such as the need to strengthen the voice of rural organisations at the policy level.

					<p>The diversity of small-scale fisheries in developing countries means that context-specific assessments are required to understand and address shortcomings in their governance.

In order to better appreciate the diversity in governance contexts for small-scale fisheries, the authors put forward a simple analytical framework focused on stakeholder representation, distribution of power, and accountability, and then outlines principles for identifying and deliberating reform options among local stakeholders. </p>

					<p>The First Global Conference on Women in Agriculture (GCWA) held in New Delhi (13-15 March 2012) was organized by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the Asia-Pacific Association of Agricultural Research Institutions (APAARI), and was supported by the multistakeholder Global Forum on Agricultural Research (GFAR) through a new mechanism “Gender in Agriculture Partnership (GAP)”. Given that gender inequalities run right through agricultural systems, action is required at all levels from household and community up to national, regional and international scales. Priorities identified were; (1) Collective advocacy to raise awareness of women’s needs in agriculture and ensure their visibility (2) Encouraging collective action and leadership among women to develop programmes that directly meet women’s needs and to make the agricultural support systems gender sensitive (3) Addressing discrimination through appropriate policies, legislation and enforcement mechanisms and establishing women’s rights (4) Ensuring that institutions and support mechanisms promote women’s ownership and control of resources.

					<p>Much of the worlds’ annual harvest loss to pests and diseases occurs as a consequence of crops grown in monocultures, or cultivated varieties with uniform resistance. This uniform resistance is met by the continuing evolution of new races of pests and pathogens that are able to overcome resistance genes introduced by modern breeding, creating the phenomenon of boom and bust cycles. One of the few assets available to small-scale farmers in developing countries to reduce pests and diseases damage is their local crop varietal diversity, together with the knowledge to manage and deploy this diversity appropriately. By performing cross-site on-farm experiments, it was possible to identify traditional varieties with higher resistance to pest and diseases when grown outside their home sites. Increased diversity of crop varieties, measured by number of varieties (richness) and their evenness of distribution, corresponded to a decrease in the average damage levels across sites and to a reduction of variance of disease damage. In sites with higher disease incidence, households with higher levels of diversity in their production systems had less damage to their standing crop in the field compared to sites with lower disease incidence. The results support what might be expected of a risk-minimizing strategy for use of diversity to reduce pest and disease damage.

					<p>Adequate and reliable funding of agricultural R&amp;D is critical for sustaining research activities. A breakdown in funding arrangements can be detrimental to the long-term existence of R&amp;D organisation/systems. Presented at the 2002 Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Conference, this paper first, reviews the trends in funding arrangements for agricultural R&amp;D in Papua New Guinea (PNG) in the late 1990s. Second, the paper explores the extent to which political influence affects funding arrangements for agricultural R&amp;D in PNG in terms of a case study. Third, with insights from the case study, which are alleged to reflect the general nature of the way agricultural R&amp;D has been funded in PNG, implications are assessed and suggestions are made about the need to diversify funding sources away from avenues that are dependent directly on political influence. </p>

					<p>In Bangladesh, where rice accounts for almost 70% of consumers’ caloric intake, the share of the less expensive coarse rice is shown to be rapidly decreasing in rice markets and the quality premium for the fine rice has been consistently on the rise in the last decades. It thus seems that the role of rice as only a cheap staple food is being redefined. The increasing demand for the more expensive varieties is seemingly associated with a more important off-farm food sector – in particular, milling, retailing, and branding – as well as a transformed milling industry. Research further found that the labour rewards for growing different rice varieties are not significantly different and that farmers do not benefit directly from consumers’ increased willingness to pay for rice.

	Average cassava yields in the tropics, barely reach 20% that which can be obtained under optimal crop management systems. Despite the generation of good cassava cultivars and elite lines, introgression of improved traits has remained a tedious and time-consuming task. In this context, genetic transformation emerged as a powerful tool to produce improved cassava in a time-efficient manner. However, production was achieved at low rates of efficiency and only with a cassava cultivar amenable to genetic transformation in well-equipped laboratories. Transfer of the technology to countries where transgenic cassava will be of practical interest was therefore an important but challenging objective. Vanderschuren notes that to make transgenic cassava available for Africa, two not mutually exclusive options, are possible: (a) production in laboratories outside Africa and importation of transgenic lines where legislation for genetically modified crops has been implemented; and (b) implementation of the cassava transformation technology in African laboratories. However, promotion and acceptance of transgenic crops will also require local capacity to develop transgenic crops and this is essential for self-determination. Training of local scientists in Africa and education and training of African scientists in laboratories where cassava transformation is routinely performed are therefore essential. He also proposes coupling the implementation of genetic transformation technologies and capacity building with careful selection of public-private R&amp;D partnerships and development of a legal biosafety framework as well as genetically modified (GM) crop regulation. Vanderschuren concludes that sustainable development and adoption of transgenic cassava in Africa cannot occur if these parameters are neglected.</p>

					<p>This in-depth article from the Institute for agriculture and trade policy (IATP, US) looks at the use of nanotechnology-based food products and food packing materials in international agricultural commodity trade. It specifically focuses on the regulation of the use of agri-nanotechnology in the marketplace. The author, Dr. Steve Suppan, gives extensive overviews of recent advancement, definition debates and regulation voids, among other. For example, he explains the debate surrounding the definition and use Engineered Nanoscale Materials (ENMs). Here, an abstract: ‘The manipulation of atomic-to molecular-sized nanoparticles (NPs) has many commercially attractive properties for manufacturers of consumer and industrial products. For example, more than a decade of research on the incorporation of ENMs into packaging for food has identified a number of applications to extend the shelf-life of packaged foods, and even detect contamination of packaged food. Food nanocoatings are just one of several food packaging applications of nanotechnology in research and development.’ (<a href="http://www.iatp.org/documents/international-standards-for-trade-in-nano-coated-produce%20" target="_blank">IATP</a>, 8/5/2012</p>

					<p>This overview report, compiled in November 2011 for the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, addresses opportunities for the development of the Pacific Islands’ mariculture sector in general terms. More specific analysis of opportunity in particular countries is presented in the five accompanying country reports (Cook Islands, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Republic of the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands). One conclusion states: ‘Despite substantial efforts and large injections of research and development (R&amp;D) finance, mariculture development in Pacific Island nations has been very limited. This is explained by the nature of mariculture, the manner in which mariculture has been promoted, and a range of more specific practical and economic constraints. Lessons have not been learned. In particular some R&amp;D organisations and government fisheries departments have repeatedly promoted development trials without undertaking the most basic analysis of production and marketing costs. Risks have not been assessed, and there has been a failure to compare objectively mariculture with existing and other potential income generating activities. As a result many small communities have served as guinea pigs for the testing of ambitious, technically driven and in many cases naïve projects.’ (<a href="http://www.spc.int/images/publications/en/Divisions/Fisheries/en-mariculture-report.pdf" target="_blank">SPC</a>, 3/2012)</p>

					<p>This paper from the WorldFish Centre examines the potential of small fish in fighting hidden hunger. Small fish are a common food and an integral part of the everyday diets of many population groups in poor countries. These populations also suffer from undernutrition, including micronutrient deficiencies (the hidden hunger). Studies in rural Bangladesh and Cambodia showed that small fish made up 50–80% of total fish intake in the peak fish production season. Small fish are a preferred food, supplying multiple essential nutrients and with positive perceptions for nutrition, health and well-being. As many small fish species are eaten whole, they are particularly rich in calcium, and some are also rich in vitamin A, iron and zinc. In areas with fisheries resources and habitual fish intake, there is good scope to include micronutrient-rich small fish in agricultural policy and programmes, thereby increasing intakes which can lead to improved nutrition and health.

					<p>This report by UNEP and SEI discusses the need to balance short-term water productivity gains, particularly in agriculture, with water flows’ long-term role in maintaining sustainable landscape ecosystem services and supporting human well-being. The report outlines 10 key messages on the nexus of water productivity, water flows in landscapes and ecosystem services, and illustrates them with case studies. It is geared to practitioners in the areas of planning and management of agriculture, planning of land-use, forestry, biofuels, and water, and natural resource management. The goal is to encourage practitioners to begin exploring what types of ecosystem services gains and trade-offs exist in their local context, such as watersheds, landscapes, countries, or basins, and how they may be linked to the allocation of water.(<a href="http://www.sei-international.org/publications?pid=2050%20" target="_blank">SEI</a> via <a href="http://blog.ecoagriculture.org/2012/05/28/unep_water_es/" target="_blank">EcoAgriculture Blog</a>, 28/5/2012)</p>

					<p>The scientific research enterprise is built on a foundation of trust. Scientists trust that the results reported by others are valid. Society trusts that the results of research reflect an honest attempt by scientists to describe the world accurately and without bias. But this trust will endure only if the scientific community devotes itself to exemplifying and transmitting the values associated with ethical scientific conduct. This book was designed to supplement the informal lessons in ethics provided by research supervisors and mentors. It describes the ethical foundations of scientific practices and some of the personal and professional issues that researchers encounter in their work. It applies to all forms of research – whether in academic, industrial, or governmental settings – and to all scientific disciplines. A continuing feature of this edition is the inclusion of a number of hypothetical scenarios offering guidance in thinking about and discussing these scenarios. </p>
