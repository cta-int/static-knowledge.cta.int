						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Gene flow of transgenes into non-target populations is an important biosafety concern. The case of genetically modified (GM) maize in Mexico has been of particular interest because of the country’s status as centre of origin and landrace diversity. In contrast to maize in the U.S. and Europe, Mexican landraces form part of an evolving metapopulation in which new genes are subject to evolutionary processes of drift, gene flow and selection. There has been little study into the population genetics of transgenes under traditional seed management. <a href="http://goo.gl/VSXeV" target="_blank">Here</a>, recently compiled data on seed management practices are combine with a spatially explicit population genetic model to evaluate the importance of seed flow as a determinant of the long-term fate of transgenes in traditional seed systems. Our results have important implications concerning the feasibility of long term transgene monitoring and control in traditional seed systems.(<a href="http://goo.gl/VSXeV" target="_blank">Bioversity International</a>, 2012)</p>

					<p>An approach that encompasses the human and natural dimensions of ecosystems is one that the Wider Caribbean Region knows it must adopt and implement, in order to ensure the sustainable use of the region's shared marine resources. <a href="http://www.oapen.org/search?identifier=391377" target="_blank">This volume</a> contributes towards that vision, bringing together the collective knowledge and experience of scholars and practitioners within the Caribbean region to begin the process of assembling a road map towards marine ecosystem-based management (EBM) for the region. It also serves a broader purpose of providing stakeholders and policy actors in each of the world's sixty-four Large Marine Ecosystems, with a comparative example of the challenges and information needs required to implement principled ocean governance generally and marine EBM in particular, at multiple levels. Additionally, the volume serves to supplement the training of graduate level students in the marine sciences by enhancing interdisciplinary understanding of challenges in implementing marine EBM.</p>

					<p>The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) is the central scientific network within the massive set of bureaucracies that is responsible for Europe's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). While spending the past 25 years failing to sustain Europe's fish stocks, this management system also became adept at making the lives of its scientists miserable. Now it is being confronted by the complex challenge of an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management. If this combination of a multi-national bureaucracy, hard politics, and scientific uncertainty has made it impossible to maintain many individual fish stocks, how are decisions going to be made that consider everything from sea birds to climate change? The old political saw that ‘if you can't solve a problem, make it bigger’ has never been put to a test like this! Yet ICES has begun to rise in an impressive way to the scientific challenge of providing advice for an ecosystem approach within the world's most cumbersome fisheries management system. <a href="http://www.doabooks.org/doab?func=fulltext&amp;rid=12747" target="_blank">This book</a> (PDF) lays out the results of extensive sociological research on ICES and the decision making systems into which it feeds. ICES is finding ways to provide effective advice in the many situations where scientific advice is needed but a clear, simple answer is out of reach. In spite of the difficulties, scientists are beginning to help the various parties concerned with management to deal with facts about nature in ways that are more useful and transparent.(Douglas C. Wilson, 2009)</p>

					<p>This paper highlights the local dimension of adaptation to climate change and the importance of local knowledge in adaptation planning. A case study of farmers’ strategies for adapting to climate vulnerability in the low valley of Ouémé showed that local people have developed a remarkable ability to adapt to climate threats, or in some cases have turned threats into opportunities. Using finger ponds around irrigated farms and building cropping dikes following an indigenous design, farmers in the region could protect their crop from stronger rains or water scarcity depending on the season.From fishing practices to agricultural techniques and through agro-fishing practices, people of low valley of Ouémé managed to take advantage of their natural vulnerability mainly based on local knowledge. In fact, the trend in applying these local strategies confirms the dynamic nature of adaptation to climate change mainly determined by the extent of vulnerability caused by continued depletion of the environment. Given that this dynamic can sometimes lead to mal-adaptation, it is necessary that local people are assisted in their coping strategies.(<a href="http://www.ajol.info/index.php/acsj/article/viewFile/81715/71861" target="_blank">African Crop Science Journal</a>, Vol. 20, 11/10/2012)</p>

					<p>Small farmers around the world urgently need to increase water use efficiency. Despite the need for low cost, simple, improved irrigation systems that could increase yields, scientific research and international development programmes have largely neglected this challenge. This is primarily due to the lack of money in these resource-limited communities. Even with increased water use efficiency, many farmers will still struggle to meet their basic food needs. Deep pipe, buried clay pot and other traditional systems work well but are often too expensive. Wick irrigation is a low cost alternative that may help many of these small farmers. A wettable fabric or rope is used to carry water from a reservoir or pipe to the roots of the plant. In its simplest form it can be done with rags and recycled bottles at almost no cost. The wicks help move the water further from the clay pot to encourage greater root development. Subsequent tests and research have demonstrated the value of wicks for irrigation even in very severe environments. These wicks can be gravity flow down (fast), capillary flow up (slow), or a hybrid.(<i><a href="http://agroforestry.net/overstory/overstory249.html" target="_blank">The Overstory</a></i>, 17/9/2012)</p>

					<p>Many Africans are presently confronted with nutritional insecurity as their diets are often deficient in essential vitamins and minerals owing to lack of sufficient consumption of fruit and vegetables. This results from problems of availability, affordability and lack of knowledge. There has been a substantive, long-term underinvestment in research and development of the horticultural sector in Africa with particular reference to those indigenous crops which are naturally high in nutritious vitamins and minerals. Lack of breeding effort, ineffective seed supply systems and an inadequate information, regulatory and policy framework have all contributed to the widespread occurrence of malnutrition on the continent. However, public sector research, development and policy amelioration efforts supported by a nascent private seed supply sector are now showing progress. Many new, improved, nutrient-dense indigenous and standard vegetable varieties are being released for which smallholder farmers are finding growing markets in both rural and urban settings. If such developments continue favourably for the next decade, it is expected that progress towards a reduction in poverty and malnutrition in Africa will be marked.(<i><a href="http://203.64.245.61/fulltext_pdf/E/2011-2015/e04523.pdf" target="_blank">Food Security</a></i> 4:115-127, 2012 via <a href="http://avrdc.org/?p=3596" target="_blank">AVRDC</a>)</p>

					<p><a href="http://goo.gl/l9GKu" target="_blank">This book</a> on taro (<i>Colocasia esculenta</i>) is among the first to offer a global approach, covering all regions, disciplinary perspectives and uses of the plant. Contributors from different disciplines and geographic regions offer the reader a multidisciplinary and evolutionary perspective on taro that shows how one of the world’s oldest domesticated plant species continues to evolve and acquire new uses. The book also demonstrates how the story of taro can serve as a model for the <i>in situ</i> conservation and use of a staple crop whose global importance is evidenced at the local level in traditional food systems, and not in global commodity markets or trade. Due to the ease with which it adapts to diverse farming systems and food cultures, taro has played a central role in the evolution of agro-ecosystems in many countries, and has helped maintain food security in continuously-evolving rice production systems. As in other crops, genetic diversity in taro has facilitated evolution of the crop. Scientific understanding of taro’s genetic diversity and management will further facilitate its use in providing global food security.(<a href="http://www.cropwildrelatives.org/resources/publications/books.html" target="_blank">Bioversity International</a>, 2010)</p>

					<p>The loss of genetic diversity of thousands of plants and crops has been well documented at least since the 1970s, and has been understood as a result of epistemological and political economic conditions of the Green Revolution. The political economic arrangement of the Green Revolution, alongside a post-war focus on economies of scale and export-oriented growth, replace high-yield single varieties of crops for a diverse array of varieties that may not have the same yield, but may be able to resist pests, disease, and changing climatic conditions. Also, the harvest does not flow in all directions equally: Whereas smallholder subsistence farming uses a large variety of crops as a food source and small-scale trade, the industrial economic system requires simplified, machine harvested ship-loads of one variety of maize, for example. Diverse varieties of different crops confound the machines, whereas one variety of wheat can be harvested with one setting on a machine. However, none of this is new. The purpose of <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/4/11/2970" target="_blank">this article</a> is to analyze how the twin concerns of lost varietals and lost cultures are bound together in the socio-political process of standardization, and to explain some areas of resistance.(<i><a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/4/11/2970" target="_blank">Sustainability</a></i> 2012, 4(11) via <a href="http://agro.biodiver.se/" target="_blank">Agricultural Biodiversity Weblog</a>, 7/11/2012)</p>

					<p>To contribute to the development of strategies for sustainable agricultural land use and biodiversity conservation in landscapes without formal protection status, researchers from AfricaRice and Wageningen UR, among others, investigated the local use and management of non-cultivated plants as important ecosystem functions of inland valleys in south Benin and Togo, and local perceptions on changes in plant biodiversity and causes for these changes. Local users of non-cultivated plants perceived agriculture and construction as major factors contributing to the reduction of (non-cultivated) plant biodiversity. However, they also collect many useful species from agricultural fields and the village. A small community forest reserve and a 2-ha community garden were the only organised forms of conservation management. Observed <i>ad hoc</i> conservation initiatives were selective harvesting of plant parts, preserving trees during land clearing, and allowing useful weed species in the field. Future development and conservation efforts in unprotected landscapes with multiple ecosystem functions should acknowledge knowledge, interests, and needs of local communities.(<i><a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08941920.2012.674628" target="_blank">Society and Natural Resources: An International Journal</a></i>, Vol 25, Is. 12, 2012)</p>

					<p>A wealth of traditional crop varieties, medicinal plants and other genetic resources are under the care of indigenous people and local communities – who need legal rights to manage them. New legal backing comes from the 2010 Nagoya Protocol to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, which requires prior informed consent for access to traditional knowledge and genetic resources, and calls for support of ‘community protocols’ that set out rules for access and benefit sharing. Community protocols are not just about indigenous rights: they clarify expectations for business and government, preserve irreplaceable biological resources, and support climate change adaptation and sustainable development. But to get these benefits, governments must back up the Nagoya Protocol with national laws and institutions, and support community-led participatory processes. Community Protocols are a vital way forward for negotiating agreements that are equitable, and conserve their local biodiversity and traditional knowledge.(<a href="http://pubs.iied.org/17137IIED.html" target="_blank">IIED</a>, 10/2012)</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.ids.ac.uk/files/dmfile/WP401.pdf" target="_blank">This report</a> is part of a study conducted by the Institute of Development Study (IDS), UK meant to understand how policy actors engage with information systems, and where knowledge intermediaries could best add value. Questions about what information and communication technology policy actors have access to (the elite they represent enjoys good access), how traditional media is used by them (used but not trusted), how they search for information (in poorer countries, they rely on forwarded information), how do they engage with the internet (no direct participation, private correspondence), and how do they value different origins of research (more trust in international research).The study’s findings show that ‘policy actors’ as part of society's elite do have access to the latest information technology. This includes ipads, tablets PCs, and smartphones: the sample of policy actors as a whole have a very similar profile of technology access to the average UK or USA household. In light of this, knowledge intermediaries need to adapt their mechanisms and pathways to ensure they contend for these emerging patterns of behaviour. About 40% of policy actors are already using smartphones, so the development of mobile apps which assist research communications would seem appropriate. There is often an assumption in knowledge intermediary work that senior policy actors may not be searching for information directly themselves, and that they are simply 'presented' with information. While this may remain the case in the poorer and/or more formally organised countries, it is less so in the mid-range countries. The implication is that where connectivity is improving, policy actors will look for information themselves. They will spend a significant amount of time looking for information, and they will be 'persistent and curious'. Finally the findings also offer an insight into 'traditional media' (radio, TV and print). Policy actors do engage with the traditional media and while we have seen that they currently have very negative perceptions of the media’s performance, nevertheless a significant proportion of them are engaging with the media day by day. There is therefore a role for the knowledge intermediary to assist the 'translation' of research and evidence into the media.Read the author’s blog post <a href="http://www.impactandlearning.org/2012/10/information-ecosystems-of-policy-actors.html" target="_blank">here</a>.(via <a href="http://www.eldis.org/go/display&amp;type=Document&amp;id=62757" target="_blank">Eldis</a>, 2/10/2012)</p>

The post has a link to a <a href="http://www.kew.org/science/ecbot/kent.html" target="_blank">webpage</a> maintained by the University of Kent listing a comprehensive compilation of online databases, search engines, checklists, image galleries, etc., meant for students in ethnobotany.This page is an overview of where to find complete plant names, conservation status and uses, citations and references managers. For the germplasm collector, <a href="http://agro.biodiver.se/" target="_blank">Agro.biodiver.se</a> also points to the Crop Genebank Knowledge Base and its page on '<a href="http://goo.gl/4oxs9" target="_blank">Published sources of information on wild plant species</a>' which is a synthesis of new knowledge, procedures, best practices and references for collecting plant diversity. It explains how and where to check taxonomy/species name, digitized botanical literature and flora guides.(<a href="http://agro.biodiver.se/" target="_blank">Agro.biodiver.se</a>, 9/10/2012)</p>

					<p>The P Index was proposed as a nutrient management tool in 1992 and has been implemented as such in the USA for the past decade. The goal of P Index use today is to help producers manage P, particularly manure-based P, while minimizing P losses and the associated environmental impacts. Included within this goal is the identification of critical source areas and strategic placement of best management practices. However, lack of water quality improvement in agricultural watersheds and discrepancies in P loss ratings between P indices have raised questions about continued use of the P Index.The papers reviewed in this Special Section of the <i>Journal of Environmental Quality</i> conclude that P indices can provide accurate assessments of P loss but must be evaluated appropriately. Evaluation will require compiling large regional P loss datasets at field and small watershed scales. Simulation models may be used to generate P loss estimates; however, models must be calibrated and validated to ensure their accuracy. Further development of P indices will require coordinated regional efforts to identify common P Index frameworks and standardized interpretations. Stringent P Index evaluations will expand the utility of P indices for critical source area identification and strategic best management practice implementation by regulatory, education, and scientific communities alike.(<i>Journal of Environmental Quality</i> 41, 09/2012 via the Soil Science Society of America, 23/10/2012)<a href="https://www.agronomy.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/41/6/1703" target="_self">https://www.soils.org/news-media/releases/2012/1105/564/</a><a href="https://www.agronomy.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/41/6/1703" target="_self">https://www.agronomy.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/41/6/1703</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

					<p>The aim of this book is to identify and explain the causes and contributors to current problems in animal husbandry, especially those related to 'factory farming', and advance arguments that may contribute to its successful re-orientation. Husbandry is considered in its broadest sense, namely the productive and sustainable use of the land for the good of all (plants, humans and other animals).The first part of the book outlines principles and arguments necessary to engage with current problems: depletion of natural resources and destruction of environment, animal welfare, food and health, fair trade and sharing resources. These arguments are illustrated by examples and sufficient evidence to justify the argument without obscuring the message.The second part presents a series of constructive proposals for change and development in animal husbandry, both in the developed world and subsistence agriculture. These include more integrated crop and livestock farming systems, the ethics of animal welfare and environmental management, and the evolution of a new social contract whereby the rights of the people to a fair share of good, safe food and a green and pleasant land are matched by a shared responsibility to preserve these things.(To be published 16 November 2012 by <a href="http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9781849714211" target="_blank">Routledge</a>)<a href="http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9781849714211" target="_self">http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9781849714211</a></p>
