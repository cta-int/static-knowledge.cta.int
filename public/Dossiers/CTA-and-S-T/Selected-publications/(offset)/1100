						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p> This issue of FARA's bulletin tries to highlight the importance of indigenous knowledge and farmer innovation, as a challenge in responding to the present overwhelming debate on climate change, the utilization of fertilizers, and biofuels. FARA has long been an advocate of innovation systems approach where innovations are not limited to scientists. We are glad to note that international as well as regional initiatives are moving forward in highlighting their increased awareness of the potential of indigenous knowledge and farmer innovation. Farmer’s themselves are getting more organized and ready to engage with private sector and research. In October 2008 in Mozambique, there will be a gathering of Via Campesina’s global federation of farmers’ organizations representing more than 100 million small farmers.</p>

					<p> Despite women's considerable role in agricultural production, they are markedly absent at the policy level in multinational corporations, international institutions, and national and state governments that determine directions for agriculture. Women are also underrepresented in agricultural science, which plays a crucial role in shaping the future of agriculture. For this special issue we invite international, transnational, and comparative studies of women and agriculture; submissions that engage feminist theoretical and historical analyses of women and agriculture; and analyses of racial, ethnic, and gendered dimensions of agriculture. We seek manuscripts on women and sustainable agriculture, on women in leadership and decision-making positions, and in feminist science studies pertaining to women's knowledge and changing agricultural practices.

					<p> 
Ephraim Nkonya et al., IFPRI Discussion Paper 756, March 2008The community-driven development (CDD) approach has become increasingly popular because of its potential to develop projects that are sustainable, are responsive to local priorities, empower local communities, and more effectively target poor and vulnerable groups. The purpose of this study is to assess the impacts of Fadama II, which is a CDD project and the largest agricultural project in Nigeria. The results show that Fadama II project succeeded in targeting the poor and women farmers in its productive asset acquisition component. Participation in the project also increased the income of beneficiaries by about 60 percent, which is well above the targeted increase of only 20 percent in the six year period of the project. Fadama II increased the demand for postharvest handling technologies but did not have a significant impact on the demand for financial management and market information. Fadama II reduced the demand for soil fertility management technologies. The decline likely reflects the project’s focus on providing postproduction advisory services and suggests the need for the project to increase its support for soil fertility management and thus limit the potential for land degradation resulting from increased agricultural productivity. Overall, the Fadama II project has achieved its goal of increasing the incomes of the beneficiaries in the first year of its operation. The unique feature that could have contributed to the significant impact of the project in a short time is its broad-based approach, which addresses the major constraints limiting the success of CDD projects that address only one or two constraints. This has implications on planning poverty reduction efforts in low-income countries. Given that the poor face numerous constraints, a CDD project that simultaneously addresses many constraints will likely build synergies that will lead to larger impacts than will a project that addresses only one or two constraints. This suggests the need for the government and donors to pool resources and initiate multipronged CDD projects rather than many isolated projects.  </p>

					<p> 
Joachim von Braun, IFPRI Policy Brief, April 2008World agriculture is facing new challenges that, along with existing forces, pose risks for poor people’s livelihoods and food security. This new situation calls for policy actions in three areas:   

 
 comprehensive social protection and food and nutrition initiatives to meet the short- and medium-term needs of the poor;  
 
 investment in agriculture, particularly in agricultural science and technology and in market access, at a national and global scale to address the long-term problem of boosting supply; and  
 
 trade policy reforms, in which developed countries would revise their biofuel and agricultural trade policies and developing countries would stop the new trade-distorting policies with which they are hurting each other.  
 

 In the face of rising food prices, both developing and developed countries have a role to play in creating a world where all people have enough food for a healthy and productive life.</p>

V. Raswant et al., IFAD, 2008 
This paper considers the pros and cons of the debate over the potential social, economic and environmental impact of the increase in biofuel production. It draws attention to the opportunities as well as the risks that biofuels present for developing countries, and stresses that the developing world has its own set of bio-energy issues distinct from those of the developed world. Key issues considered include the following: Food versus fuel: Can the agriculture sector meet biofuel demand without compromising food security? Farmers might benefit from high commodity prices but what about net purchasers of food? Climate change and environment: How effective are biofuels in mitigating climate change? Are we using the right yardstick to determine the amount of energy required to produce biofuels in developing countries where farmers are less likely to use nitrogen fertilizers and practice mechanized farming? Land use and tenure security: Will the increase in biofuel demand increase land use competition between food and fuel crops and result in tenure insecurity for small farmers? Impact on poverty alleviation: How does biofuel development affect the food security, energy needs and employment opportunities of poor rural people? The authors conclude that, despite the negatives, as a renewable energy source, biofuels can help mitigate climate change and reduce dependence on oil in the transportation sector. They can also have a positive impact on the limited foreign exchange reserves of many developing countries and, when well managed, can offer large new markets for higher prices products for agricultural producers that could stimulate rural growth and farm incomes.  </p>

G. Tansey and T. Rajotte, IDRC, 2008 In today’s world, access to food is highly, and unacceptably, uneven. There is massive overproduction and over-consumption, yet millions experience scarcity and hunger. This book looks at some of the forces and rules shaping the food system and who has control over it. In particular, the book focuses on rules on intellectual property – for example patents, plant breeders’ rights, trademarks and copyright – and their relations to other rules on biodiversity, an essential requirement for food security. It looks through the lens of intellectual property (IP) at the future control of food and farming, arguing that rules on IP are central to struggles over the distribution of wealth and power in the 21st century. After an overview of key issues, the following chapters go into depth on a range of international bodies and policy instruments, including negotiations and instruments in the WTO, the Convention on Biological Diversity, FAO, the World Intellectual Property Organization and the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants. The book concludes by discussing civil society responses to relevant changes and developments in these issues, how they affect the direction of research and development, the nature of global negotiation processes and various alternative futures. </p>

					<p> 
Mirjam Macchi et al., IUCN Issues Paper, March 2008
The ingenuity of indigenous peoples is too often overlooked by policymakers making decisions related to climate change – even though they are among the most vulnerable to its impacts, according to a new report. The report points out that indigenous people usually occupy marginal and remote areas, such as small islands, coastal plains, mountain areas and drylands, where they are exposed to adverse environmental effects. Although these populations develop coping strategies, the severity of future climate change may exceed this adaptive capacity. Furthermore, they are often socially vulnerable – lacking rights, infrastructure and support, and with fragile livelihoods based only on natural resources.The areas liable to the greatest changes in climate, and indeed already affected, include the Amazon region, the Caribbean, southern Africa and southern Latin America – all containing large numbers of indigenous people. ‘Indigenous peoples’ vast experience in adapting to climate variability will not be sufficient – they also need better access to other information and tools,’ says Gonzalo Oviedo, co-author of the report and IUCN senior advisor on social policy. The report emphasises the need to involve indigenous communities more in research and debate on climate change. ‘In the Arctic, scientists and indigenous people work together. It opens doors to knowledge not accessible through Western scientific methods,’ says co-author Sarah Gotheil of IUCN’s Global Marine Programme. </p>

					<p> UNESCO, 2007. Women and girls around the world are excluded from participation in science and technology (S&amp;T) by poverty, lack of education and aspects of their legal, institutional, political and cultural environments. this UNESCO report is designed to support eff orts being made worldwide to analyze, discuss and change this situation. Based on empirical research and data, the report incorporates substantive inputs from institutions involved in science, technology, gender studies and policy. Marking the start of an ongoing initiative, it aims to spur serious discussion and action in national and international scientific and academic communities, especially regarding the pressing needs to increase women’s participation in S&amp;T careers and enable sex-disaggregated data collection and rigorous research development, along with increasing public awareness of gender issues. With its goal of helping educators, policy-makers and the members of the scientific community to address the underlying causes of gender disparities in S&amp;T, both in the public and private sectors, this report represents an important contribution to the political and institutional mainstreaming of the gender dimension in S&amp;T.</p>

In the first article, “Development of marine resources, fisheries policies and women’s rights in the Pacific Islands”, Vina Ram-Bidesi reflects on the importance of marine resources in the Pacific Islands. She also analyses the current issues in fisheries policies and how they affect women in the region. She points out that the basic problems of limited access to resources and subordination continue to persist for women. In addition, new and complex problems are now facing women because of globalization of the fishing industry. These require a greater evaluation of fisheries policies at a higher level and the involvement of women in decision-making at national, regional and international levels to help reduce the negative impacts of the global fish trade.</p>

					<p> 
Lídia Cabral, Natural Resource Perspectives 114, Overseas Development Institute, April 2008The 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness will be reviewed at the Third High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Accra in September 2008. The Paris Declaration establishes operating principles for donors and recipient governments to improve the effectiveness of aid. These include government leadership of the development process, a focus on policy results, greater alignment by donors with national policies and management systems, harmonisation between donors with division of labour, and mutual accountability for development results. These principles are broadly sound for guiding development cooperation with national governments. However, they do not help in addressing the challenges arising in certain areas of assistance. In agriculture, the overwhelmingly private nature of agricultural activities, the roles of non-governmental service providers, the significance of context and the cross-sectoral dimension of policy challenges are some of the reasons why development cooperation in that sector struggles to comply with the Paris principles. The paper sets out areas requiring focused attention in the run-up to Accra 2008. </p>

					<p> 
Martin Prowse and Leo Peskett, <i>ODI Opinion</i> 97, April 2008The impact of climate change is of vital importance. But, for the world’s poor, policies to mitigate climate change may, in the short term, have as much impact as climate change itself. Climate change poses a risk to poor and marginalized com&amp;shy;munities not only through its physical impact, but also through policy responses to its real or perceived threats. This is not to discount the physical impacts. Environmental change is here, and the decisions we make now will influence our ability to adapt now and in the future. But, in the short term, the urgent pres&amp;shy;sure to implement mitigation policies could have unintended consequences on the poor. Encouragingly, there are indications that the impacts of mitigation measures are receiving high-level policy attention. Buried within the ‘Bali Roadmap’ is a small sub-clause referring to the need to consider the ‘economic and social consequences of response measures’ (Bali Action Plan Decision, 2007). This Opinion assesses four mitigation strat&amp;shy;egies and their possible impacts on the poor: environmental labelling; green growth strate&amp;shy;gies; biofuel production and food prices; and forest protection. We focus on sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). First, because the region lags behind on progress towards MDG1 (poverty reduction), and second, because SSA has con&amp;shy;tributed least to greenhouse gas emissions, but may suffer most from the impacts of climate change.  </p>

					<p> 
IDS Bulletin 38(5), Eds: Joanna Chataway, Harro Maat and Linda Waldman, November 2007 Science and technology need society. But does society need science and technology? Research proposals and technological planning have little chance of success without anticipating their effects on society. They gain wider acceptance by engaging citizens in debates on potentially controversial developments such as nanotechnology. This acceptance may be guided by norms or ethical principles, or may also be commercially viable. The participatory agenda for science and technology is pushed by global supra-national networks, with programmes across all continents. So how does participation relate to science and technology? What are the power relations between scientists, policy makers and members of the public? What types of scientific and technological decisions can be influenced through participation? Science and technology is everywhere and taken for granted in our daily lives – drinking water from a tap, buying food from a supermarket – and are implicit in development assumptions about modernisation and economic growth. Nonetheless, this is a changing world where questions of risk, safety and innovation are paramount. Scientific expertise can no longer rely on its assumed inherent authority. News headlines broadcast controversies about how people mobilise around topics like climate change or GM crops. Innovative new measures – such as consensus conferences, citizens’ juries and community-based environmental audits – have been adopted to encourage public participation, and now frequently characterise science and policy processes both north and south. </p>

The next five years will be decisive for the future direction of international development co-operation in general and EU co-operation in particular. The European Commission (EC) plays a crucial role in EU development cooperation, as a facilitator as well as a sizeable donor in its own right. Despite ambitious international aid goals, there is a lack of shared understanding of key underlying issues that shape the EC aid effectiveness debate. On the basis of the outcomes of the research and consultation phases, a final report will be completed in spring 2008.

					<p> 
Rebecca Holmes and Rachel Slater, ODI Opinion 91, December 2007 More than two decades separate two major World Development Reports on rural agriculture: the 1982 report on ‘Agriculture and Economic Development’ and the 2008 report ‘Agriculture for Development’. During this time, there has not only been a marked shift in the way in which the agricultural sector has been addressed within international policy, but there have been radical changes in the way that women’s roles in development, particularly in rural development and agriculture, have been perceived, analysed and addressed. The case for gender equality has been strengthened over the years by research and advocacy that have informed international and national policy debates. Economist Ester Boserup’s work on women in agriculture in the 1970s and 1980s was pivotal in its analysis and recognition that women were not merely pas¬sive in the development process, but that their reproductive and productive roles were neces¬sary for poverty reduction and growth. </p>

Edited by J. Kesan, CAB International, 2007 Scientists are becoming progressively more involved in developing methods for increasing agricultural productivity and designing plants with certain qualities. As such, genetic engineering has given plant breeders a means to exercise property rights over different varieties of plants. This has created many implications and given way to much controversy, with most objections being raised against the idea of owning life. With the use of comparative studies, this book discusses the legal, agribusiness and public policy issues that connect intellectual property protection with advancements in agricultural biotechnology. </p>

					<p> 
Eds P. Anandajayasekeram et al., CAB International, 2007 The need for agricultural research resources in the developing world cannot be underestimated, but the availability of such resources is often poor due to lack of funding and investment. In order for Africa and other such developing countries to achieve productivity in agriculture – vital to food security, poverty reduction and sustainable management of natural resources – investment and policy development needs to be assessed. This book, a joint effort from IFPRI, ILRI and the Kellogg Foundation, explores the importance of impact assessment studies in Africa, and assembles important evidence to pave the way for further, much needed investment in agricultural research all over the developing world. </p>

Eds. Chris Pollock et al., Special issue of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 363(1491): 445–446, February 2008 Today, global agriculture feeds a population of approximately 6.4 billion and delivers a wide range of additional services. These range from waste management and water purification through delivery of fuel, fibre and chemical products to recreation and the conservation of biodiversity. Significant elements of global tourism depend upon 'sympathetic' management of farmland. On the positive side, food production has kept pace with demand and there have been improvements in safety and reliability of supply while prices have fallen. On the negative side, the global population still experiences major inequalities in production, distribution and consumption while the environmental footprint of agriculture is increasingly recognized as a threat to our planet's capacity to provide vital ecosystem services. Over recent years, the concept of 'sustainability' has emerged and this has been a driver for the development of technologies, practices, products and processes that can maintain the required level of output in a way that compromises future capacity as little as possible. It is recognized that sustainability is a term that requires qualification and is highly case-sensitive. However, there is little doubt that increasing attention is being paid to the development of agricultural systems that seek to 'rebalance' the positives and negatives of farming and to do what is feasible to protect for the long-term future, the production capacity and ecological well being of the land. These two special issues of Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B seek to address in detail the approaches that are being adopted to make agriculture more sustainable and to consider those in a regional context as well as through the contribution that individual components can make to whole systems. </p>
