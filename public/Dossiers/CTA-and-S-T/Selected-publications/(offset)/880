						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	<i>Insights from the Nile Basin in Ethiopia - </i>By Edward Kato, Claudia Ringler, Mahmud Yesuf, and Elizabeth Bryan, IFPRI, June 2009. This study investigates the impact of different soil and water conservation technologies on the variance of crop production in Ethiopia to determine the risk implications of the different technologies in different regions and rainfall zones. Given the production risks posed by climate change, such information can be used by decision makers to identify appropriate agricultural practices that act as a buffer against climate change. Using a household- and plot-level data set, the Just and Pope framework was applied using a Cobb-Douglas production function to investigate the impact of various soil and water conservation technologies on average crop yields and the variance of crop yields, while controlling for several household- and plot-level factors. Results show that soil and water conservation investments perform differently in different rainfall areas and regions of Ethiopia, which underscores the importance of careful geographical targeting when promoting and scaling up soil and water conservation technologies. </p>

					<p>This report compiles perspectives on the impact of climate change on the livelihoods of fisher folk from presentations made at the Forum by CERMES fisheries scientists, fishermen, and other marine science experts. A main conclusion is that, while much attention has been paid to the devastating impact that climate change can have on coral reefs in the region (including the widespread ‘bleaching’ death on reefs across the Caribbean in 2005 due to rising water temperatures), little research has been carried out into the potential impact of the phenomenon on the fishing, fish processing, trade and fisheries technical support services related to small-scale fisheries. As a result, more research and public outreach is being planned by CERMES and partner organizations to address climate change impacts on fisheries.

					<p>This Oxfam Australia report highlights the urgent need for the Pacific Islands Forum to address the dramatic effects of climate change within the region. Another conclusion is that Pacific Islanders are already feeling the effects of climate change and are in need of greater support. People are facing increasing food and water shortages, losing land and being forced from their homes, dealing with rising cases of malaria, and coping with more frequent flooding and storm surges. The report argues that unless wealthy, developed countries like Australia take urgent action to curb emissions, some island nations face the very real threat of becoming uninhabitable.

					<p>One of the lingering effects of the food price crisis of 2007–08 on the world food system is the proliferating acquisition of farmland in developing countries by other countries seeking to ensure their food supplies. Increased pressures on natural resources, water scarcity, export restrictions imposed by major producers when food prices were high, and growing distrust in the functioning of regional and global markets have pushed countries short in land and water to find alternative means of producing food. These land acquisitions have the potential to inject much-needed investment into agriculture and rural areas in poor developing countries, but they also raise concerns about the impacts on poor local people, who risk losing access to and control over land on which they depend. It is crucial to ensure that these land deals, and the environment within which they take place, are designed in ways that will reduce the threats and facilitate the opportunities for all parties involved.

					<p>
Science, technology and innovation must be at the centre of economic growth, and livelihood improvement and development more broadly. But it must always be asked: what innovation - and for whom? Decisions about direction, diversity and distribution are key in any discussion of innovation options and wider development pathways.In March 2009 over 50 pastoralists from across southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya from a dozen ethnic groups gathered in the Borana lowlands at the ‘University of the Bush’ to debate key pastoral development issues. This weeklong event was hosted by the Oromia Pastoralist Association and organised by the Democracy, Growth and Peace for Pastoralists project of the Pastoralist Communication Initiative. Intense and animated discussions took place under the trees next to a tented camp established in the Gujji pastoral area. The Future Agricultures Consortium was represented by Ian Scoones of IDS and Andrew Adwera of African Centre for Technology Studies based in Kenya. Following two days of discussion of the implications of mobility and changes in land tenure led by Katherine Homewood of University College, London, the seminar turned to the question of innovation inpastoral systems.

					<p>Developing countries with large greenhouse gas emissions play a decisive role in negotiating a post-Kyoto climate agreement. No effective program to reduce global emissions is possible without their support. At the same time, developing countries face a delicate task in balancing their growing responsibility for a sustainable climate with the pursuit of continued economic development. This article discusses the negotiating positions major developing country emitters are taking on core issues. Among the most vital unsettled questions are burden sharing between developed and developing countries, the role of the market in the international climate architecture, as well as implementation arrangements. An annex discusses current mitigation policies of major developing country emitters, and argues that developing countries are already taking meaningful action to limit the growth of their greenhouse gas emissions.

					<p>This paper describes the major institutional weaknesses in global nutrition and presents two recommendations to address the joint problems of incoherence, lack of institutional leaders, and persistent underfunding. First, within the domain of global health—where a significant part of the programmatic response rests—current and potential funding agencies at the international level could create a shared set of principles that lay out expectations for the coordination, coherence, and collaboration among institutions that currently do or might receive funding for global nutrition programs. Funders could collaborate to create a strong incentive for UN agencies, the World Bank, privately funded initiatives, and others to work together to fulfill key functions, including norm-setting, advocacy, scientific inquiry, program and technical support, capacity-building, and implementation at the national level. A second priority is for leaders in UN agencies to act on specific opportunities to elevate the agenda of nutrition security within the work of the UN System High-Level Task Force for the Global Food Security Crisis, which is stimulating and coordinating a response among the UN system and international financial institutions.

					<p>This brief is based on a recently completed benchmarking survey conducted by the ASTI initiative and the African Women in Agricultural Research and Development (AWARD) project with the objective of obtaining gender-disaggregated capacity indicators in agricultural R&amp;D. The study found that the total professional agricultural capacity employed at the 125 Sub-Saharan African research and higher education agencies included in the study increased by 20 percent between 2000/01 and 2007/08. Of concern, however, is that about two-thirds of this capacity increase (that is, female and male) consisted of staff holding only BSc degrees, indicating a decline in average qualification levels of agricultural research and higher education staff in certain Sub-Saharan African countries. The overall share of female professional staff in agricultural research and higher education increased from 18 percent in 2000/01 to 24 percent in 2007/08. The growing share of professional women employed in agriculture and female students enrolled in agricultural sciences indicates that the gender gap in African agricultural sciences may be narrowing, especially in southern Africa. This trend is not reflected, however, in a number of West African countries as well as Ethiopia.</p>

					<p>This paper, which is published by GFAR, gives a detailed explanation of past and current trends in funding of agricultural research and analyzes various agricultural research funding mechanisms that have been used in the past and should be explored today in order to increase agricultural research outputs in developing countries.vBecause underfunding threatens the survival of agricultural research systems in many developing countries, policymakers and development assistance agencies must find alternative institutional mechanisms for sustained financing. Some such alternative mechanisms include: joint public-private sector ventures, sale of research products, competitive funds, research foundations, farmer managed levies on production, and greater involvement of universities and private sector research. While exploring the potential of these alternative funding mechanisms is very important, another part of the solution is to create better managed and more flexible public sector systems, as the public sector is the greatest source of funding for agricultural research in developing countries. While government financing made up 81% of total funding for agricultural research in developing countries, the growth rate of public spending on agricultural research across the globe (developing and high income countries) has decreased in the past two decades.</p>

The biggest part of this 16-page document provides an overview of the main kinds of agricultural biotechnologies that have been used in the crop, forestry, livestock, fishery and agro-industry sectors in developing countries in the past and that were covered in a e-mail conference which runned from 8 June to 5 July 2009. It was hosted by the FAO Biotechnology Forum and was being held as part of the build up to the <a href="http://www.fao.org/biotech/abdc/conference-home/en/" target="_blank">FAO international technical conference on Agricultural Biotechnologies in Developing Countries</a>. </p>

					<p> 
M. Pimbert et al. (eds) International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), 2006 The knowledge, priorities and aspirations of small scale producers are rarely included in policy debates on the future of food, farming and development. In response, an electronic conference, &quot;The Future of Food and Small-scale Producers&quot; sought the views of indigenous, small, and family farmers from over 30 developed and developing countries. The forum also included the opinions of landless people and fishing communities, as well as their representative organisations. This book summarises participants' contributions to the questions: what does sustainable agriculture and land/water use mean to you? What prevents small-scale producers from achieving their vision? What needs to change to allow small-scale producers to achieve their vision? Participants' responses emphasise the importance of holistic approaches that minimise negative environmental and health effects, respect for traditional approaches and knowledge, and recognition for the way that small-scale food production contributes to a whole social system, not just economic production. Conversely, they also suggest that only locally rooted social processes can create sustainable systems. The book concludes with reflections on the process of conducting an electronic conference and addressing barriers such as language and illiteracy. </p>

					<p>By Bioversity International and COGENT, January 2008. COGENT (the International Coconut Genetic Resources Network) had conducted several consultations on the conservation and use of coconut diversity to assist coconut growing countries to develop a progressive conservation strategy. This strategy was reviewed during a meeting gathering genebank managers, international experts and the COGENT Steering Committee in December 2007. The strategy aims to optimize the conservation of as much representative diversity as possible in the most cost-effective manner for the short, medium and long term. </p>

					<p>Increased understanding of the substantial threat climate change poses to agriculture has not been met with a similarly improved understanding of how best to respond. This report examines likely shifts in crop climates in Sub-Saharan Africa under climate change to 2050, and explores the implications for agricultural adaptation, with particular focus on identifying priorities in crop breeding and the conservation of crop genetic resources. </p>
