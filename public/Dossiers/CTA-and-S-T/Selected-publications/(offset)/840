						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>This study examines the global patterns and impacts of droughts through the mapping of several drought-related characteristics – either at a country level or at regular grid scales. Characteristics cover various aspects of droughts – from global distribution of meteorological and hydrological drought risks to social vulnerability and indices related to water infrastructure. The maps are produced by integrating a number of publicly available global datasets. The subsequent discussion of maps allows a number of policy-relevant messages to be extracted. It appears that arid and semi-arid areas also tend to have a higher probability of drought occurrence. The report points out that in drought years, the highest per capita loss of river flow occurs in areas that do not normally experience climate-driven water scarcity. It also illustrates that the African continent is lagging behind the rest of the world on many indicators related to drought preparedness and that agricultural economies, overall, are much more vulnerable to adverse societal impacts of meteorological droughts. Regions with an unreliable and vulnerable nature of river discharge, and having the largest drought deficits and durations are highlighted, pointing to the danger of focusing on drought mitigation measures on river flows alone. The ability of various countries to satisfy their water needs during drought conditions is examined using storage-related indices.Authors: N. Eriyagama, V. Shmaktin &amp; N.

					<p>This study explores—spatially explicitly, for current and projected future climate, and for different management intensity levels—the potential for increasing global crop production through on-farm water management strategies: (a) reducing soil evaporation (‘vapor shift’) and (b) collecting runoff on cropland and using it during dry spells (‘runoff harvesting’). A moderate scenario, implying both a 25% reduction in evaporation and a 25% collection of runoff, suggests that global crop production can be increased by 19%, which is comparable with the effect of current irrigation (17%). Climate change alone (three climate models, SRES A2r emissions and population, constant land use) will reduce global crop production by 9% by 2050, which could be buffered by a vapor shift level of 50% or a water harvesting level of 25%. Even if realization of the beneficial effects of rising atmospheric CO2 concentration upon plants was ensured (by fertilizer use) in tandem with the above moderate water management scenario, the water available on current cropland will not meet the requirements of a world population of 9–10 billion.

					<p>
Biofuels have attracted growing attention of policy, industry and research. The number of scientific publications devoted to biofuels is growing exponentially, and the number of reviews is increasing rapidly. For decision makers it has become a hard job to find robust reference material and solid guidance. Uncertainty on the overall assessment has been growing with the findings of the possible benefits and risks of biofuels. The International Panel for Sustainable Resource Management is taking up the challenge and, as its first
report, provides another review on the widely debated field. It does so in the conviction that substantial progress requires an advanced approach which goes beyond the production and use of biofuels, and considers all competing applications of biomass, including food, fibres and fuels. A widened systems perspective is adopted with a particular focus on the potential impacts of land use change depending on the types of biofuels used and growth of demand.This report is the result of a thorough review process, based on research of recent publications (mainly until the end of 2008, but considering also eminent articles published before June 2009), and the involvement of many experts worldwide. The report intends to provide policy relevant information on the assessment of the environmental and social costs and benefits of biofuels. It examines both the concerns of critical developments, and describes the options for a more sustainable use of biomass and measures to increase resource productivity. The focus is on first generation biofuels thus reflecting the state-of-the-art and data reliability. Nevertheless, the report puts technology and policy development into perspective. It marks uncertainties and addresses the needs for research and development, also for advanced biofuels. In doing so, it delivers no final word, but a concentration of current knowledge, aimed to support decision making and future scientific work towards a sustainable “bio-economy”.Authors: S.

					<p>This report builds on the important work done thus far by drawing attention to the actors facilitating the land grab. In particular, it examines the role of international financial institutions in promoting private investment in agriculture and land markets in response to the global food crisis. Multilateral institutions - for example, the IMF, the private sector branch of the WB - are further impelling the shift from public to private sector control over food resources. This report explores and highlights the implications and potential consequences of this shift for global food security. It also questions the viability of the “win-win” argument that has been offered to quell concerns around this trend, pointing out that a myopic focus on potential benefits, such as increased investment in agriculture in poor countries, belies the gravity of the risks while removing the issue of food security for the world’s poor from the forefront of the debate. Rapid acquisitions of crucial food-producing lands by foreign private entities pose a threat to rural economies and livelihoods, land reform agendas, and other efforts aimed at making access to food more equitable and ensuring the human right to food for all. The great land grab, thus, argues that there is a dangerous disconnect between increasing investment in agriculture through rich countries taking over land in poor countries and the goal of securing food supplies for poor and vulnerable populations.Authors: S.

					<p>This research paper seeks to identify the legal measures under the EU food safety policy which ‘cause the most problems for developing [country] exporters’ and propose possible solutions. It notes that food safety requirements have been identified as ‘one of the foremost issues affecting exports of agricultural and food products from developing countries’, with shortcomings in compliance that are estimated to cost African exporters over US$1 billion per annum in lost exports. The analysis identified seven key characteristics of the EU food safety regime, among which: its coherence in terms of all foodstuffs, including imported foodstuffs; its comprehensive nature, covering products from farm to fork; and the centrality of consumer protection concerns. It is argued that these characteristics of the EU food safety regime ‘do not take into account the consequences of the food safety regime which go beyond the Community’s borders’. Equally, EU standards do not take into account the different conditions of production and certification existing in developing countries. This, it is held, results in a situation where at times EU food safety standards ‘may constitute a barrier to exports into the Community’.Author: M.

					<p>Over the past decade, coffee producers have been struggling with the world market’s low and unstable coffee prices. Some coffee producing countries try to overcome this crisis by moving from pure commodity exports to higher-price exports of niche market quality products, like “single-origin coffee”, protected by intellectual property tools. Such protection can take the form of trademarks or geographical indications. At present within the single-origin coffee sector, a trend to use the latter form can be observed. For example, “Café de Colombia” was registered as a Protected Geographical Indication under Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006. Another recent example is the Ethiopian Fine Coffee Trademarking and Licensing Initiative. In order to protect its coffee industry, the Ethiopian government has filed trademark applications for the country’s most valuable brands in over 30 countries, including all major coffee markets. This article suggests that both concepts offer mixed blessings. The particularities of the global coffee market might in some cases be better accommodated by a trademark scheme whilst in other cases by a geographical indication system. However, in order to ensure the individual farmer benefits from the higher price paid for single-origin coffee on the world coffee market, further steps have to be taken.Author: L.

					<p>The continued crisis is likely to put a damper on commodity prices for the near future. However, the medium term projections are still upbeat, with prices expected to remain well above pre-2007 peaks. On average OECD-FAO projects that nominal prices for all sectors will be 15-60% above the levels of the decade before the 2007-08 peaks. FAPRI also expects prices to remain strong over the projection period, though they are less bullish than OECD FAO about dairy prices. Agriculture is expected to cope better than other sectors with the economic crisis due to the relatively low income elasticity for food, at least in developed countries. However, the question of food security in developing countries remains a concern. Although not immune to the current economic malaise, developing countries are projected to remain the main source of growth in world demand and trade once economic growth resumes. FAPRI expects the biggest increase in grain and oilseeds demand to be in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, driven by population growth, the expansion of livestock production and increased demand for biofuel feedstocks. Except for wheat and coarse grains, production is also increasingly shifting away from developed countries to emerging and middle income developing countries.Authors: OECD and FAO, July 2009</p>

					<p>It has often been argued that new agricultural technologies lead to poverty reduction. This paper argues that any changes in poverty situation attributed to those who adopt new agricultural technology (treatment group) without a counterfactual comparison of carefully selected nonadopters (control group) are likely to be questionable. The paper estimates the effects of new agricultural technology on poverty reduction by employing the “double difference” method on data collected in rural Nigeria. Seeing the agricultural technology–poverty linkage through the lenses of adopters and nonadopters of such new technology provides understanding of the relationship between agricultural technology and poverty. The paper finds that differences in poverty status between adopters and nonadopters of new agricultural technologies (a combination of tube wells and pumps) introduced in rural Nigeria in the late 1980s and early 1990s are alarmingly modest. The paper concludes that new agricultural technology would not expressly lead to poverty reduction in poor countries. The exact channels through which new agricultural technology impact poverty outcomes need to be further explored.Author: O. Babatunde, IFPRI discussion paper, September 2009</p>

					<p>Commonly adopted approaches to managing small-scale fisheries (SSFs) in developing countries do not ensure sustainability. Progress is impeded by a gap between innovative SSF research and slower-moving SSF management. The paper aims to bridge the gap by showing that the three primary bases of SSF management—ecosystem, stakeholders’ rights and resilience—are mutually consistent and complementary. It nominates the ecosystem approach as an appropriate starting point because it is established in national and international law and policy. Within this approach, the emerging resilience perspective and associated concepts of adaptive management and institutional learning can move management beyond traditional control and resource-use optimization, which largely ignore the different expectations of stakeholders; the complexity of ecosystem dynamics; and how ecological, social, political and economic subsystems are linked. Integrating a rightsbased perspective helps balance the ecological bias of ecosystem-based and resilience approaches. The paper introduces three management implementation frameworks that can lend structure and order to research and management regardless of the management approach chosen. Finally, it outlines possible research approaches to overcome the heretofore limited capacity of fishery research to integrate across ecological, social and economic dimensions and so better serve the management objective of avoiding fishery failure by nurturing and preserving the ecological, social and institutional attributes that enable it to renew and reorganize itself.Read the <a href="http://www.worldfishcenter.org/resource_centre/WF_2395.pdf" target="_blank">online pdf</a>.</p>

					<p>Female farmers play a vital role in African agriculture, accounting for 60 to 80 percent of the agricultural workforce. However, agricultural research and higher education are disproportionately led by men. There is an urgent need for a greater representation of women in the field of agricultural science and technology (S&amp;T) in Sub-Saharan Africa. Female scientists, professors, and senior managers offer different insights and perspectives to help research institutes to more fully address the unique and pressing challenges of both female and male farmers in the region. Gender-disaggregated data on S&amp;T capacity are scarce, often lack sufficient detail, and focus more generally on S&amp;T rather than on agriculture specifically. Data are not always comparable due to different methodologies and coverage. The ASTI initiative and the CGIAR G&amp;D program partnered together to address this information gap. This brief summarizes the key results from their benchmarking survey of 125 agricultural research and higher education agencies in 15 Sub-Saharan African countries.Read the <a href="http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/asti-award-brief-1.pdf" target="_blank">online pdf</a>.</p>

					<p>For many millions in the developing world, land is central to livelihoods, food security, even identity – the result of a direct dependence on agriculture and natural resources. It is not surprising, then, that a recent wave of large-scale land acquisitions in poorer countries has sparked a major debate. Through these acquisitions, interests in richer countries are buying or leasing large tracts of farmland for agricultural investment in Africa, Central and Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. With some deals involving hundreds of thousands of hectares, these investments have been dubbed “land grabs” by the media. But this is too simplistic. Depending on the way they are structured, these investments can either create new opportunities to improve local living standards, or further marginalise the poor. An analysis of this complex and shifting situation, focusing on Africa, lays out key trends, drivers and main features, and outlines how to make the renewed momentum in agricultural investment work for local development and livelihoods.Read the <a href="http://www.iied.org/pubs/pdfs/17069IIED.pdf" target="_blank">online pdf</a>.</p>

					<p>The book outlines the critical issues facing us in the 21st century, developed from the results of last year’s World Conservation Congress in Barcelona. IUCN's Senior Science Advisor Jeff McNeely takes us through this landmark publication. The landmark publication takes on the pressing issues of today and highlights the solutions to be found through investing in nature. With the key Copenhagen climate change meeting just months away and the 2010 Biodiversity Targets from the Convention on Biological Diversity under the spotlight, the book is essential reading for today’s governments, businesses and decision-makers. It provides a snapshot of the current situation, split into 21 easy-to-read sections, as well as a roadmap for the future.Read the <a href="http://data.iucn.org/dbtw-wpd/edocs/2009-026.pdf" target="_blank">online pdf</a>.</p>

					<p>The impact of climate change on population distribution and mobility is attracting growing interest, as well as heated debate. Frequently cited figures estimate that by 2050, the number of people forced to move primarily because of climate change will range between 200 million and 1 billion. Underlying these predictions is the view that migration reflects a failure to adapt to changes in the physical environment, and that migrants are a relatively undifferentiated group all making similar emergency responses and moving to unspecified destinations, including international ones. This is somehow at odds with more nuanced views of migration as a key adaptive response to socio-economic, cultural and environmental change. From this perspective, the specific characteristics of migrant flows – duration, destination and composition - are essential to understand their impact on sending and destination areas, and to develop appropriate policies. However, in most cases migration is still seen by many government and international agency staff as disruptive and requiring control and restrictive measures. The key argument of this paper is that what is needed urgently is a radical change in perceptions of migration, and a better understanding of the role that local and national institutions need to play in making mobility be seen as part of the solution rather than the problem.Read the <a href="http://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/users/schensul/public/CCPD/papers/Tacoli%20Paper.pdf" target="_blank">online pdf</a>.</p>

					<p>The paper develops indicators to look at the performance of the irrigation sector in Sub-Saharan Africa, where demand for food is high and irrigation has a proven potential to boost levels of agricultural productivity. By looking at six indicator categories—institutional framework, water resource use, irrigation area, irrigation technology, agricultural productivity, and poverty and food security—we assess the potential for improving performance in the agricultural food security sector through increasing irrigation sector investments. The indicators on water resource use indicate ample room for further development of the resource. The share of cultivated area equipped for irrigation in Africa is about a third of the world average and just one-sixth of the value for Asia. The low coverage of irrigation technology and the slow rate of growth in coverage clearly represent a lost opportunity for Africa and a tremendous potential for future investment and policy effort. Finally, African countries produce 38 percent of their crops (by value) from approximately 7 percent of their cultivated land on which water is managed, which again suggests that additional investment in irrigation would pay large benefits. The disproportionate contribution to agricultural production of Africa’s small irrigated area suggests that returns on additional investment in irrigation would be high, both in terms of greater food security for the continent and greater production of export-quality agricultural goods.Read the <a href="http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ifpridp00894.pdf" target="_blank">online pdf</a>.</p>

					<p>In the first half of 2008, the world was facing the highest food price levels in 30 years and a global food insecurity crisis. Although international food prices have since fallen, they are still above the levels seen in recent years and are expected to remain so. FAO estimates that soaring food prices pushed another 115 million people into chronic hunger in 2007 and 2008, bringing the world total to nearly one billion hungry people. This report explains why food prices increased and the steps needed to ensure that high food prices become an opportunity for developing country farmers to help safeguard world food supplies at affordable prices. It focuses on the extent to which “new” explanations - biofuel demand, record oil prices and increasing food demand in China and India - can account for the sudden food price inflation as well as the role of traditional market drivers. It also explores why so few producers in developing countries responded by investing more and increasing production.

					<p>World food production must increase by 70 percent in 2050 to feed a projected extra 2.3 billion people. The demand for cereals, both for food and animal feed, is projected to reach some 3 billion tons by 2050. This means that cereal production would have to grow by almost a billion tons (2.1 billion tons today). FAO states that meat production would also have to grow by over 200 million tons by 2050. The demand for food is expected to grow as a result of rising incomes as well as population growth. Despite the fact that 90 percent of the growth in crop production is projected to come from higher yields and increased cropping intensity, FAO estimates arable land will have to expand by around 120 million hectares in developing countries, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. The agency also notes that biofuels could also increase the demand for agricultural commodities, depending on energy prices and government policies.Read the <a href="http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/wsfs/docs/Issues_papers/HLEF2050_Global_Agriculture.pdf" target="_blank">online pdf</a>.</p>
