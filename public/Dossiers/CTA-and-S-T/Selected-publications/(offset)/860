						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>The balance of debates about innovation systems ideas in agricultural and rural development seems to have shifted from conceptualisation and historical analysis to planning and practice. National and international development agencies are now grappling with the need to rethink their investments in line with this new perspective. In this month’s LINK LOOK, Andy Hall, Jeroen Dijkman and Rasheed Sulaiman suggest ten priority topics where rethinking is needed and where there seems to be enough experience to provide advice.</p>

Higher temperatures, more variable precipitation, and changes in the frequency and severity of extreme climate events will have significant consequences for food production and food security. However, the frequency of heat stress, drought, and flooding are also expected to increase, even though they cannot be modeled satisfactorily with current climate models. They will undoubtedly have adverse effects on crops and agricultural productivity over and above the effects due to changes in mean variables alone. The impacts of climate change on agriculture are likely to be regionally distinct and highly heterogeneous spatially, requiring sophisticated understanding of causes and effects and careful design and dissemination of
appropriate responses. These changes will challenge the livelihoods of farmers, fishers, and forest-dependent people who are already vulnerable and food insecure. Adapting to these changes, while continuing to feed a world of 9 billion people, requires the formation of a global partnership in science, technology development, and dissemination of results tomillions of smallholder farmers, bringing together research workers and resource managers from many fields. To take an international approach to climate change, new partnerships must be forged, linking the agricultural research and climate science communities.View <a href="http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/focus16_02.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>.</p>

					<p>By investing billions in conserving natural areas now, governments could save trillions every year in ecosystem services, such as natural carbon sinks to fight climate change, according to a European report The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB). The TEEB report focused on the economic cost of biodiversity loss around the world. For years, biologists have been warning that the world may be entering a new mass extinction with extinction rates estimated at a thousand times above normal. This cumulative loss of biodiversity, if allowed to continue, will have great economic consequences according the report. The study recommended that delegates at the UN Summit on Climate Change in Copenhagen in December make stabling a payment system for forest conservation a priority, otherwise known as REDD.View <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/biodiversity/economics/pdf/teeb_report.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>.</p>

					<p>A Dutch study by the University of Twente has assessed the water requirements of 13 bioenergy crops across the world. The findings could help select the best crops and locations to produce bioenergy. The EU climate action and renewable energy package has set a target of increasing the share of renewable energy to 20 per cent of energy used by 2020. This includes a minimum 10 per cent share for transport, which could include biofuels. This study used the concept of a water footprint in order to compare the water needs of various crops. A water footprint is the total annual volume of fresh water used to produce goods and services at the place of production and in this case is measured in m3 of water per Gigajoule of energy produced (m3/GJ). In this study it consists of two components: rainwater used during crop growth and surface and groundwater for irrigation. 12 crops were investigated that contribute most to global crop cultivation, currently making up 80 per cent of total agricultural production. It also investigated the plant jatropha, used to make biodiesel in India, Indonesia, Nicaragua, Brazil and Guatemala. Water footprints were calculated for the production of various types of bioenergy, including heat and electricity, biodiesel and bioethanol. Since climate and production vary according to location, the footprints were calculated by country.View <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/06/03/0812619106.full.pdf+html" target="_blank">PDF</a>.</p>

	Many national and local economies are already vulnerable to climate events, in the form of floods, droughts, heat waves, and tropical storms. Climate adaptation is thus an urgent priority for the custodians of national and local economies, such as finance ministers and mayors. Such decision-makers ask: What is the potential climate-related loss to our economies and societies over the coming decades? How much of that loss can we avert, with what measures? What investment will be required to fund those measures – and will the benefits of that investment outweigh the costs? This report provides decision-makers with a systematic way of answering these questions. Focusing specifically on the economic aspects of adaptation, it outlines a fact-based risk management approach that national and local leaders can use to understand the impact of climate on their economies – and identify actions to minimize that impact at the lowest cost to society. The report is based on the initial findings of a study by the Economics of Climate Adaptation Working Group, a partnership between the Global Environment Facility, McKinsey &amp; Company, Swiss Re, the Rockefeller Foundation, ClimateWorks Foundation, the European Commission, and Standard Chartered Bank.</p>

					<p>Large-scale acquisitions of farmland in Africa, Latin America, Central Asia and Southeast Asia are making headlines in a flurry of media reports across the world. Lands that only a short time ago seemed of little outside interest are now being sought by international investors by the tune of hundreds of thousands of hectares. And while a failed attempt to lease 1.3 million hectares in Madagascar has attracted much media attention, deals reported in the international press constitute the tip of the iceberg. The report draws on a literature review, on qualitative interviews with key informants internationally, on national inventories of ongoing and proposed land acquisitions since 2004 in five African countries (Ethiopia, Ghana, Madagascar, Mali and Sudan) and qualitative studies in Mozambique and Tanzania, and on legal analysis of national law and of a small sample of investor-state contracts.View <a href="http://www.iied.org/pubs/display.php?o=12561IIED" target="_blank">PDF</a>.</p>

Contrary to the strongly held belief that the continent is not ready to embrace new technologies, much has been accomplished in agricultural biotechnology. The document narrates notable scientific breakthroughs, political support, policy formulation, capacity building and awareness creation on agricultural biotechnology in the continent. It highlights activities in three African countries (South Africa, Burkina Faso and Egypt) that have commercialized biotech crops and are now experiencing socio economic benefits as well as improved environmental conservation.View <a href="http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/biotech_crops_in_africa/download/default.asp" target="_blank">PDF</a>.</p>

					<p>This report focuses on pastoralist women from pastoral communities across the world producing a global good practice study on pastoralist women’s empowerment. When reading about women in pastoral societies it is common to find reference to their marginalised roles, their hardship, their oppression and their lack of power as opposed to men’s domination, men’s ownership, men’s power and associated patriarchal relations. However, pastoral women are extremely strong and powerful people. Despite the many challenges women face, they do find ways to ensure that the household’s basic needs are met; they do find ways to access resources and within the pastoral system do have ‘rights’ to ownership and use of many of them; and they do find ways to get their voices heard.View <a href="http://www.iucn.org/wisp/?3627/Report---WOMENS-EMPOWERMENT-IN-PASTORAL-SOCIETIES" target="_blank">PDF</a>.</p>

					<p>This paper summarises the current state of food security in Africa and relate this to activities that form part of the EU-Africa partnership on the Millennium Development Goals, that would allow keys gaps in the programme to be identified. There is much variation in both the levels of food availability and trends since 1990 across regions and between countries. Generally, Northern and Western Africa show higher levels and rising trends: performance in the rest of the continent is more variable. As proxy indicators for access to food, the record on economic growth per capita, the value of agricultural production against rural population as a rough measure of rural incomes, and reported poverty rates were examined.View <a href="http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=3721&amp;title=africa-food-security" target="_blank">PDF</a>.</p>

					<p>This new agroforestry study was released at the opening of the 2nd World Congress of Agroforestry. It shows that almost half of all farmed landscapes worldwide include significant tree cover. This is the first study to quantify the extent to which trees are a vital part of agricultural production in all regions of the world. From the data presented in the study, it is not possible in all cases for the researchers to discern precisely the products and services that trees are providing. However, a great deal of previous agroforestry research has documented a wide range of uses for trees on farms, including: fertilizer trees for improving crop yields and enhancing soil health; fruit trees for nutrition; fodder trees to feed livestock; timber and fuelwood trees to provide shelter and energy; medicinal trees; and trees that provide global commodities such as coffee, rubber, nuts, gums and resins. As equally important on the service side are uses such as erosion control, water quality and biodiversity.View <a href="http://www.worldagroforestry.org/downloads/publications/PDFs/WP16263.PDF" target="_blank">PDF</a>.</p>

Important differences also exist between women and men in their contributions to agriculture, and in poverty, nutrition and food security levels. This review aims to provide insights into the performance of agricultural activities by gender, and provide a gender analysis of poverty, nutrition, and food security.

					<p>From Canada to Chile, from Kazakhstan to Kansas, we are witnessing a fast-changing planet. What will it look like in the years, decades and centuries to come? How far and in what ways can Earth's systems be stressed before they reach tipping points, undergoing rapid transitions to new states--with unforeseen consequences? So asks a report released by the National Science Foundation’s Advisory Committee for Environmental Research and Education (AC-ERE). The report finds both challenges and opportunities in the path to finding answers. ‘The report's focus on environmental complexity and the need to understand how our social systems integrate with the rest of Earth's systems is an important message,’ Collins (NSF assistant director for Biological Sciences and coordinator for environmental research and education) believes. ‘Research at the interface of natural and human systems forms the underpinnings for the adaptation and mitigation strategies needed for a changing planet.’View <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/geo/ere/ereweb/ac-ere/nsf6895_ere_report_090809.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>.</p>

					<p>This book combines the latest scientific observations on climate change, with evidence from the communities Oxfam works with in almost 100 countries around the world, to reveal how the changing climate is already hitting poor people hard. The report outlines evidence of how climate change is affecting every issue linked to poverty and development from access to food and water to health and security. It warns that without immediate action 50 years of development gains in poor countries will be permanently lost. One of the most worrying trends highlighted in the report is the impact of erratic weather on agriculture. Poor farmers, who can no longer rely on seasons, are losing crop after crop because of sudden heat waves or heavy rains.View <a href="http://www.oxfam.org/en/policy/bp130-suffering-the-science" target="_blank">PDF</a>.</p>

					<p>The report provides an objective analysis of pressing long-term social and economic development issues, and discusses the positive and negative impact of corresponding policies. The analyses are supported by analytical research and data included in the annex. The survey seeks to bridge the gap between climate change and development agendas within the public policy debate. It argues that mitigation and adaptation efforts can move forward effectively only if they are part of a consistent development strategy built around a massive investment-led transformation along low-carbon, high-growth paths. While acknowledging that a variety of market and non-market institutional mechanisms will be needed if advances are to be made along those paths, the survey contends at the same time that a critical role must be played by developmental states able to mobilize public finance and build appropriate technological capacity. This potentially win-win strategy will require the readiness of the international community to step up to the plate with multilateral financing on a much larger scale than has been forthcoming to date and new approaches to transferring technology from rich to poor countries.View <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/policy/wess/wess2009files/wess09/wess2009.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>.</p>

					<p>This paper outlines the activities that the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity plans to undertake to support all stakeholders to celebrate the International Year of Biodiversity (IYB), both those that are already under way, as well as those under development. It also includes planned and confirmed activities by other partners. The purpose of the International Year is to raise public awareness of the importance of biodiversity and the consequences of its loss. It will also seek to promote the engagement of the public and other actors for the implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Its overall objective is to obtain a commitment by the global community to reinforce implementation of the Convention.View <a href="http://www.cbd.int/iyb/iyb-2010-strategy-final-en.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>.</p>

	Although the islands of the Caribbean are marked by nuanced differences which define the social, economic and political fabric of each individual country, there are broad similarities which make the islands, as a collective, all vulnerable to the risks and impacts of climate change. </p>

Climate change impacts such as more frequent and severe floods and droughts will affect the food and water security of many people. The impact of climate change on aquatic ecosystems, fisheries and aquaculture, however, is not as well known. This policy brief, a joint partnership between several agencies, highlights this issue to ensure that decision makers and climate change negotiators consider aquatic ecosystems, fisheries and aquaculture at the UNFCCC COP-15 in Copenhagen, December 2009. Investments are urgently needed to mitigate growing threats and adapt to their impacts - but also in building our knowledge of complex ocean and aquatic processes. The overarching requirement is to reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases – the primary human driver of climate change. Fisheries and aquaculture need specific adaptation and mitigation measures that: 1) improve the management of fisheries and aquaculture and the integrity of aquatic ecosystems; 2) respond to the opportunities and threats to food and livelihood security due to climate change impacts, and 3) help the fisheries and aquaculture sector reduce greenhouse gas emissions.link to event: Copenhagen climate change conference December 2009 and ACP Fisheries Policy brief </p>
