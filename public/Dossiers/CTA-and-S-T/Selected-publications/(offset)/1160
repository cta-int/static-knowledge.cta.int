						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

Statistics-gathering on the participation of women in research remains an obstacle course, as Unesco’s Institute for Statistics found out when it put together a bulletin on women in science last year. Although the institute could pride itself on providing comparable data for 86 countries, some of the world’s research hotspots were conspicuous by their absence, among them China, the UK and USA. Why are half the countries in the world missing from the study and what needs doing to improve both the visibility of women in national statistics and cross-national comparability? The irony is not lost on Ernesto Fernández Polcuch, responsible for science and technology statistics at the UIS. ‘Despite the growing demand for cross-nationally comparable statistics on women in science’, he laments, ‘national data and their use in policy-making often remain limited. Even when data are available, they may not be internationally comparable.’ The UIS Bulletin concludes that the under-representation of women in research ‘can be traced back to education systems, particularly at the higher levels.’ It goes on to say that ‘it is of utmost importance to further analyse other aspects hindering women’s access to, continuity and advancement in research positions. This involves issues related to stereotyping, working conditions – the work/personal life balance – labour market conditions, governance and the role of researchers in society … Decision-makers in the field of higher education and science policy cannot ignore this issue.’Source: Unesco Horizons, April-June 2007 </p>

					<p> 
A growing number of voices are raising concerns about the impact on biomedical innovation of fragmented intellectual property rights. Although systematic analysis is lacking, there is anecdotal evidence of fragmented patent landscapes – including in such highly significant public health cases as malaria vaccine development. It has often been suggested that patent pools (agreements where patent holders agree to license their IP as a package) could help to solve this problem. The rationale is simple: by reducing the number of necessary transactions and by simplifying patent landscapes, they can reduce transaction costs and facilitate technology transfers. Yet, despite this potential and the success of patent pools in other sectors (notably consumer electronics), they remain largely untested in biotechnology. In this paper, we seek to explain this fact and to evaluate the future prospects for the use of patent pools in biotechnology.Source: P. Gaulé, Innovation Strategy Today 2(2):123-134. </p>

This year’s edition of The State of Food and Agriculture 2007 concludes that carefully targeted payments to farmers could be a promising approach to protect the environment and to address growing concerns about climate change, biodiversity loss and water supply. The volume explores the potential for agriculture to provide enhanced levels of environmental services alongside the production of food and fibre. Demand for environmental services from agriculture – including climate change mitigation, improved watershed management and biodiversity preservation – will increase in the future, but better incentives to farmers are needed if agriculture is to meet this demand. As one among several other possible policy tools, payments to farmers for environmental services hold promise as a flexible approach to enhancing farmer incentives to sustain and improve the ecosystems. Nevertheless, challenges must be overcome if the potential of this approach is to be realized, especially in developing countries.Source: FAO annual Report. SOFA 2007. 15 November 2007 </p>

					<p> 
There are many regional cooperation efforts in use as strategies for capacity building in science and technology. These include regional centres jointly owned by a group of countries, institutional networks and networks of regional centres of excellence. Each type has its objectives and achieves results at a different rate, to a different extent and at a different cost. In order to understand which model to use it is therefore necessary to know the state of the problem, the rate at which one wants the solution to evolve and the resources available for cooperation. This paper presents results of a survey of the state of science and technology human resource capacity in higher education institutions in the region. The human resource capacity for scientific and technological research in higher education institutions is minimal. Thus, there is need for a model of regional cooperation that will rapidly increase human resource potential in all areas of science and technology. The paper describes the challenges and opportunities of regional cooperation and analyses the performance of different models in the region with a view of identifying the most suitable one for rapid generation of large number of scientists in the region. Two cases are presented: UNESCO’s African Network of Scientific and Technological Institutions (ANSTI) as an example of institutional network, and the CGIAR as an example of networks of centres of excellence.Source: JGM Massaquoi, UNESCO Regional Office for S&amp;T in Africa, Nairobi, Kenya. </p>

This year’s report calls for placing the sector at the center of the development agenda if the goals of halving extreme poverty and hunger by 2015 are to be realized. The last WDR on agriculture was published was in 1982, making this a landmark report that comes when many are calling for an African agricultural revolution. While 75% of the world’s poor live in rural areas in developing countries, only 4% of official development assistance goes to agriculture. In Sub-Saharan Africa, a region heavily reliant on agriculture for overall growth, public spending for farming is also only 4% of total government spending and the sector is still taxed at relatively high levels. The report finds that for the poorest people, GDP growth originating in agriculture is about four times more effective in raising incomes of extremely poor people than GDP growth originating outside the sector. The authors argue that a dynamic ‘agriculture-for-development’ agenda can benefit the estimated 900 million rural people in the developing world who live on less than $1 a day, most of whom rely on agriculture for a living.Source: World Bank, October 2007 </p>

‘Gender discrimination practices truly limit the ability of many developing countries to grow and reduce poverty,’ warns a report released this month by UNESCO. ‘Much talent is being wasted as girls turn away from S&amp;T careers and as women in S&amp;T become discouraged by discriminatory treatment.’ The report also notes that ‘differences between girls and boys in performance at school are more linked to home and school environments than dependent on innate differences.’ It is thus hardly surprising that ‘women scientists are more likely than their male counterparts to have at least one parent who is a scientist.’ Science, Technology and Gender has been coordinated by UNESCO’s Division for Science Policy and Sustainable Development. Based on empirical research and data, the report incorporates substantive input from institutions involved in science and technology (S&amp;T), gender studies and policy. Marking the start of an ongoing initiative, it aims to spur serious discussion and action in national and international scientific and academic communities, in order to increase women’s participation in S&amp;T careers, enable sex-disaggregated data collection and rigorous research development, and build public awareness of gender issues.Source: UNESCO, December 2007 </p>

					<p> 
Even without climate change, African agriculture faces serious challenges—land degradation, inadequate irrigation, rural-to-urban migration, political instability, and stagnant economies. Slow technological progress and a lack of access to information on how to cope with climate change are further constraints. In this brief, Ariel Dinar describes a recent study—the first to analyze climate impact and adaptation across the African continent and to combine cross-country observed and simulated data—that provides economic insights into the magnitude of the impact and the value of adaptation. The results suggest that large regions of marginal agriculture in Africa may be forced out of production by 2100, while others will thrive. Millions of agriculture-dependent, water-deprived people in the most vulnerable countries will need information, technologies, and supporting institutions to adapt to further climate deterioration. Some countries being more vulnerable than others, help must be focused where it is needed most.Source: World Bank Research Brief, August 2007 </p>

					<p> 
Adaptation to climate change involves changes in agricultural management practices in response to changes in climate conditions. It often involves a combination of various individual responses at the farm-level and assumes that farmers have access to alternative practices and technologies available in the region. This study examines farmer adaptation strategies to climate change in Southern Africa based on a cross-section database of three countries (South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe) collected as part of the Global Environment Facility/World Bank (GEF/WB) Climate Change and African Agriculture Project. The study describes farmer perceptions to changes in long-term temperature and precipitation as well as various farm-level adaptation measures and barriers to adaptation at the farm household level. A multivariate discrete choice model is used to identify the determinants of farm-level adaptation strategies. Results confirm that access to credit and extension and awareness of climate change are some of the important determinants of farm-level adaptation. An important policy message from these results is that enhanced access to credit, information (climatic and agronomic) as well as to markets (input and output) can significantly increase farm-level adaptation. Government policies should support research and development on appropriate technologies to help farmers adapt to changes in climatic conditions. Examples of such policy measures include crop development, improving climate information forecasting, and promoting appropriate farm-level adaptation measures such as use of irrigation technologies.Source: C.

Climate change worries coupled with high oil prices and increasing government support top a set of drivers fueling soaring rates of investment in the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries, according to a trend analysis from the UNEP. The report says investment capital flowing into renewable energy climbed from $80 billion in 2005 to a record $100 billion in 2006. The renewable energy sector’s growth ‘although still volatile ... is showing no sign of abating.’ Among the report’s insights: Investment in sustainable energy is still mostly in OECD countries, but investment in developing countries is growing quickly: 21% of the global total in 2006, compared with 15% in 2004. Much of the investment occurred in China, followed by India and Latin America, with sub-Saharan Africa notably lagging behind. Investments in small-scale projects rose 33% from an estimated $7 billion in 2005 to $9.3 billion in 2006 – they are attracting growing interest, driven partly by opportunities in developing countries, which stand to benefit most from small-scale installations (e.g. solar roof panels and micro turbines).Source: UNEP/SEFI/New Energy Finance, 2007 </p>

					<p> 
How can farmers be linked more closely to research? This document presents the results of a workshop held by the Drylands Coordination Group (DCG) in Eritrea in December 2003, which aimed to identify problems and recommend solutions in bridging the gap between research, extension and the farmer. The workshop consisted of four presentations and working groups. Participants included many farmers from different regions and livelihood sources.Source: A. Negassi and Y.

Despite the rhetoric of bottom-up development, the international development agenda remains dominated by the economic interests and institutional priorities of the North, and supported by knowledge generated through Northern Universities, resource centres and think tanks. One means of addressing this imbalance is to ensure that the research used to determine and justify development priorities is both Southern-driven and accessible to Southern-based policymakers and development practitioners. IFRTD has pioneered and tested a networked research approach that fully reflects its southern-driven networking principles.

Proceedings of the 4th All-Africa Conference on Animal Agriculture, Arusha, Tanzania, September 2005 
This volume contains over 50 papers by leading experts in biotechnology covering animal health, genetic diversity and improvement and animal feeds and nutrition. The technologies reported range from conventional approaches to more advanced molecular techniques. African scientists and stakeholders in the livestock sector discussed the potential role of biotechnology in animal agriculture to improve the livelihoods of African people. The conference aimed to address several questions: Is biotechnology a menace or an opportunity to address the pressing needs for sustainable livelihoods of poor people? What are the potentials and limitations/threats of biotechnology? Are there proven technologies currently available which Africa can immediately take up to address the known constraints? What are the current technical and institutional constraints to livestock biotechnology research and development in Africa? How can Africa organise itself to take full advantage of available opportunities and to minimise possible threats?Source: J.E.O. Rege, A.M. Nyamu and D. Sendalo (eds), ILRI, 2007 </p>

					<p> 
The 7th RTD Framework Programme (FP7) places new emphasis on international research cooperation. This publication outlines how the new approach to international cooperation is intended to work in FP7, focusing on the first two years of implementation. 
The new approach involves innovative mechanisms for promoting international research collaboration to address three interdependent objectives: supporting European scientific and economic development through strategic partnerships with third countries in selected fields of science and by engaging the best third country scientists to work in and with Europe; facilitating contacts with partners in third countries with the aim of providing better access to research carried out elsewhere in the World; and addressing specific problems that third countries face or that have a global character (e.g. by contributing towards MDGs, addressing global climate change, combating biodiversity loss, water and energy scarcity). The approach is significantly different from that under FP6. It aims at integrating international research collaboration through both geographical and thematic targeting, and partnership and dialogue.Source: European Commission, DG Research, 2007 </p>
