						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p> 
The development of biofuels has generated vigorous debate on economic and environmental grounds. Our attention here is on its potential impacts on poverty reduction. The potential is large, whether through employment, wider growth multipliers and energy price effects. But it is also fragile: it will be reduced where feedstock production tends to be large scale, or causes pressure on land access, and its success can be undermined by many of the same policy, regulatory or investment shortcomings as impede agriculture. Whilst some of the factors facilitating, and impacts of, biofuels can be tracked at global level, its distributional impacts are complex, and point to the need for country-by-country analysis of potential poverty impacts.Source: Leo Peskett et al., Natural Resource Perspectives 107, ODI, June 2007 </p>

This report calls for the creation of an international bio-energy certification scheme to ensure that products meet environmental standards. It warns that energy crops could have negative environmental consequences if they replace primary forest, or divert land, water and other resources away from crop production. The report also warns that the biofuel industry risks raising the price of food; prices of maize have already risen between 2006 and 2007. According to UN figures, global production of biofuels has doubled in the past five years, and is likely to double again in the next four years, raising concern that environmental or social damage could outweigh the benefits. The report recommends that new policies are implemented to steer energy production in a sustainable direction, protecting land and social security. The FAO's Senior energy co-ordinator Gustavo Best said that the guidelines were required because the industry is ‘so fast, so disorganised and so misinformed.’Source: UN-Energy, May 2007 </p>

					<p> 
Despite considerable investment, agriculture in Kenya is characterised by declining food production per capita and worsening environmental degradation. Why have technologies which have worked elsewhere failed? How can female cultivators be encouraged to consider new methods? This paper analyses factors influencing farm mechanisation choices at the household level in Bondo district, Kenya. Significant investments in African agricultural R&amp;D have had limited impact on rural livelihoods. Farmers either fail to adopt new technologies, or apply them inappropriately. Technical aspects of mechanisation are widely documented but little is known about the social, cultural, economic, and environmental factors that influence farmers’ mechanisation choices. Failure to identify different people’s needs and preferences in the design and implementation of programmes has resulted in low demand for new technologies. The paper suggests the need for greater training, extension services, credit and tractor hire services to improve technology transfer. Source: id21 Research Highlight, 17 July 2007.

Changes in the global environment have led some to question whether the conventional wisdom on the role of agriculture in economic development is still relevant to Africa today. This report critically examines the literature on this issue, taking both the conventional and skeptical views into account. It complements this review with case studies of five African countries. The findings indicate that agricultural growth will play an essential role in promoting overall economic growth and reducing poverty in most of Africa's agrarian-based economies. This holds true even for countries that have the potential for industrial growth driven by natural resources. The results also show that only smallholder food-staple and livestock production can generate broad-based agricultural growth. By demonstrating that Africa's agricultural and food subsector cannot be bypassed, this report contributes to an important ongoing debate in development studies.Source: Xinshen Diao et al.

This report is about the role of biotechnology in the transformation of African economies. The implications of its recommendations, however, need to be seen beyond the confines of biological innovations. They address critical issues related to Africa’s place in a globalizing economy. Undertaken at the request of heads of state and government, this report demonstrates what is needed to build the required capacity to harness and apply biotechnologies to improve agricultural productivity, public health, industrial development, economic competitiveness, and environmental sustainability (including biodiversity conservation) in Africa. It also shows that the measures needed to address biotechnology will strengthen Africa’s capacity to adapt other technologies to economic development. In fact, previous inabilities to build capacity in fields such as information technology hamper the continent’s efforts in biotechnology. This report has placed these systemic considerations in the context of the role of innovation in economic transformation. It challenges Africa’s heads of state and government to take seriously the importance of a coordinated approach in promoting technological innovation in development.Source: Report of the High-Level African Panel on Modern Biotechnology, chaired by Calestous Juma and Ismail Serageldin.

					<p> 
Scientific research has contributed greatly to the improvement of agricultural practices in Africa; but despite the availability of high-yield and pest-resistant varieties of major crops, there is still a huge gap between the potential provided by this germplasm and the reality of farming yields (the yield gap), leaving Africa a long way from food sufficiency. The most important reasons for this are the continent’s degraded soils and lack of invest¬ment in adequate soil management. Furthermore, the impact of soil degradation goes beyond food deficits, as soil is also relevant to other human needs as a regulator of water availability and quality, of greenhouse gases which affect the climate, and of the natural enemies of pests and diseases. This document examines the scientific and technological require¬ments for redressing these failures and for scaling up the widespread adoption of the use of soil management practices to conquer both the yield gap and environmental damage. It also addresses the necessary scientific and technical capacity required to achieve this, while recognizing that a supportive economic and political framework is essential for the investment in science and technology to succeed.Source: M.J.

A report for the NEPAD Science and Technology Forum.
If agriculture is to serve as the economic motor that spurs development, as it has elsewhere in the world, the soil fertility problem must be tackled comprehensively. Much remains to be done. Human and institutional capacity building requires external and internal support. African institutions need to be able to offer attractive employment packages and working conditions that could attract and retain the best. Training should focus on supporting African science catch up with modern approaches to soil science. Capacity building must be implemented in a way that ensures an increase in the number of young scientists capable of undertaking world class science. At the heart of all of this is the question of funding. Complacency in comprehensively addressing the problem fertility decline will only lead to delays with dire consequences for the people of Africa. The message of his book is that many factors interact in different ways and that no single factor can determine the outcome. However, how a society chooses to respond to the challenges that these changes bring can make all the difference. Globalization of markets, accelerated human induced climate change, land and other natural resource degradation, infectious diseases and population growth all pose serious challenges for Africa. The response to date has not been commensurate with the challenge.Source: Louis V. Verchot et al., ICRAF, 2007 </p>

Dryland degradation and desertification now affect almost a billion people around the world. Tragically, the biological resources and productivity of millions of acres of land are lost to desertification each year because people remain unaware of strategies and techniques that could improve yields, reduce risk, and begin healing the world’s deserts. This is the first book to offer practical, field-tested solutions to this critical problem. The book discusses the ecology of desert plants, explores the causes of desertification and land abuse, and outlines the processes and procedures needed to evaluate, plan, implement, and monitor desert restoration projects. Each chapter represents a guide to a critical topic for environmental restoration; extensive photographs, diagrams, and drawings give detailed information for immediate application.Source: David A.

The need for agricultural research resources in the developing world cannot be underestimated, but the availability of such resources is often poor due to lack of funding and investment. In order for Africa and other such developing countries to achieve productivity in agriculture – vital to food security, poverty reduction and sustainable management of natural resources – investment and policy development needs to be assessed. This book, a joint effort from IFPRI, ILRI and the Kellogg Foundation, explores the importance of impact assessment studies in Africa, and assembles important evidence to pave the way for further, much needed investment in agricultural research all over the developing world.Source: P.

Knowledge is becoming more and more important in the global sphere of competition and production. There is a danger that LDCs will be increasingly marginalized if they do not enhance the knowledge content of their economies and achieve economic diversification through learning and innovation. The Report suggests that national governments and development partners could meet this challenge, notably through greater attention to four key policy issues: integrating science, technology and innovation policies into development and poverty reduction strategies; intellectual property regimes; preventing the loss of skilled human resources through emigration; and how knowledge aid (as part of official development assistance) could be used to support learning and innovation in LDCs. The report is the first comprehensive insight into the development objective of technological learning and innovation capacity building in LDCs. It is intended to increase awareness of this issue and enrich the policy dialogue toward the new ‘paradigm shift’ on poverty reduction through productive capacity building.Source: UNCTAD, July 2007 </p>

The increase in world agriculture prices caused by the global boom in biofuels could bring major benefits to the world’s rural poor who have been suffering under low prices for decades. This is a conclusion of a major study coordinated by the German Agency for Technical Cooperation. If implemented in smart ways on the basis of strong policies, hundreds of millions of the world's poorest people, the majority of whom live in rural areas, stand to benefit massively from the global biofuel transition. The report confirms many previous scientific assessments on the poverty alleviating potential of bio-based energy and products. The report assesses the range of 'sustainability' issues the biofuels industry will present in the years ahead, ranging from implications for the global climate and water resources to biological diversity and the world’s poor. But, as many experts have stressed, a far larger group of poor people stands to benefit from biofuels, namely those who live in rural areas. Rising agricultural prices may have major economic benefits. In Sub-Saharan Africa more than 60 per cent of people make a living off the land and low agricultural prices as well as trade barriers and subsidies in the wealthy West have kept them in dire poverty. Biofuels offer a unique opportunity to break this lethal status quo, according to the report.Source: Worldwatch Institute/Earthscan, July 2007 </p>

This paper proposes principles and key areas for EU-AU cooperation on agricultural development in Africa, focusing on regional and continental levels. Cooperation at these levels will complement and stimulate agricultural development at the national level, which is where the most intense cooperation will continue to take place. It will build on the policy orientations set out in the ‘European Consensus’ and the EU Strategy for Africa. Both documents reiterate that agriculture and rural development are crucial in terms of reducing poverty and stimulating growth. The cooperation areas listed in this paper provide a long-term framework for assistance. In a geographical sense, there is a focus on Sub-Sahara Africa, where the agricultural problems are most pressing.Source: Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament COM (2007) 440 final, 24 July 2007 </p>
