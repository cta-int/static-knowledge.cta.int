						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Agriculture in Haiti has suffered three decades of crisis and institutional neglect. Nevertheless, almost 60% of Haitians live in rural areas and rely on farming for their livelihoods. For that reason, agriculture must play a central role in post-earthquake reconstruction. However, the plans and programmes of the Haitian government and the international community have proven insufficient to revitalize the sector and improve conditions for small-scale farmers, and have failed to recognise the important roles of women in agriculture.The Haitian government and the main actors in agriculture should continue to prioritise agricultural development, while putting greater emphasis on long-term programmes to assist Haitians to get back on their feet and improve their living conditions with dignity.(OXFAM Policy and Practice, 15/10/2012)<a href="http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/planting-now-2nd-edition-revitalizing-agriculture-for-reconstruction-and-develo-248432?cid=em_CPD_PPCT_1012_octnewsletter" target="_self">http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/planting-now-2nd-edition-revitalizing-agriculture-for-reconstruction-and-develo-248432</a></p>

					<p>This position paper published by the Royal Tropical Institute (KIT) examines why companies are increasingly sourcing their agricultural supplies in Africa, and whether they are doing so in ways that are helping to reduce poverty. It concludes that local sourcing in Africa offers significant opportunities for both companies and small farmers. Sustainable local sourcing offers a significant opportunity to improve the livelihoods of small-scale producers in Africa.It is a business model that forces all actors in the supply chain to collaborate and create attractive win-win situations for all. Of course there are still risks involved. African markets are still far behind developed markets in other parts of the world, and considerable investments are needed in basic infrastructure, education, and the service sector.(KIT information portal on Value Chains, 2012)<a href="http://search.kit.nl/vivisimo/cgi-bin/query-meta.exe?v:project=kit-portal-VCFD&amp;query=692622" target="_self">http://search.kit.nl/vivisimo/cgi-bin/query-meta.exe?v:project=kit-portal-VCFD&amp;query=692622</a></p>

					<p>The hypothesis of <a href="http://www.perscentrumrabobank.com/pressbasket/download?m_id=579" target="_blank">this study</a> is that the resolution of current and future imbalances in food supply is virtually inconceivable without tapping into the underused agricultural production potentials of existing small-scale farms in many developing and emerging economies. Written from an economic and business friendly perspective, this report by Rabobank researchers sees small farmers in developing countries and emerging economies are the key to a successful approach to the world food problem.As smallholder productivity is still very low, a large underexploited food production potential is yet to be unlocked. The establishment of farmer cooperatives would facilitates their connection to the markets and the international food chains and provides access to financial services. The authors argue that the productivity of smallholder agriculture may increase substantially through the interaction between commercial players in the food chain and farming organisations, as well as through partnerships with governments.(Rabobank Economic Research, 10/2012)News: <a href="https://www.pressroomrabobank.com/publications/food__agri/rabobank_cooperatives_small_farmers_in_developing_countries_key_to_successfully_solve_the_world_food_problem.html" target="_self">https://www.pressroomrabobank.com/publications/food__agri/rabobank_cooperatives_small_farmers_in_developing_countries_key_to_successfully_solve_the_world_food_problem.html</a>Report: <a href="http://www.perscentrumrabobank.com/pressbasket/download?m_id=579" target="_self">http://www.perscentrumrabobank.com/pressbasket/download?m_id=579</a></p>

					<p>This book assesses the institutional, technical and market constraints as well as opportunities for smallholders, notably emerging farmers in disadvantaged areas such as the former homelands of South Africa. Emerging farmers are previously disadvantaged black people who started or will start their business with the support of special government programmes. Public support programmes have been developed as part of the Black Economic Empowerment strategy of the South African government. These programmes aim to improve the performance of emerging farmers.This requires, first and foremost, upgrading the emerging farmers’ skills by providing access to knowledge about agricultural and entrepreneurial practices. To become or to remain good farmers they also need access to suitable agricultural land and sufficient water for irrigation and for feeding their cattle. Finally, for emerging farmers to be engaged in viable farming operations, various factors need to be in place such as marketing and service institutions to give credit for agricultural inputs and investments; input markets for farm machinery, farm implements, fertilizers and quality seeds; and accessible output markets for their end products.This book develops a policy framework and potential institutional responses to unlock the relevant markets for smallholders.PDF: <a href="http://www.doabooks.org/doab?func=fulltext&amp;rid=14597" target="_self">http://www.doabooks.org/doab?func=fulltext&amp;rid=14597</a></p>

					<p>In March 2012 the Future Agricultures Consortium and the Institute of Statistical, Social, and Economic Research co-hosted an international conference on 'Young People, Farming and Food' in Accra, Ghana. This conference examined how young people engage with the agri-food sector in Africa and how research findings were being integrated into policy processes.It also explored the dynamics of change in different components of the agri-food sector and the implications for young people. The articles in this IDS Bulletin are drawn from the conference. They discuss social and economic structures, aspirations, livelihoods, land and policy, and illustrate the multiple dimensions, scales and complex dynamics of the young people and agriculture 'problem' – and why simplistic 'solutions' are likely to fail. It is hoped that this collection will stimulate the research to fill an evidence gap of very significant proportions.(IDS Bulletin Vol. 43, Is. 6, 11/2012)<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/idsb.2012.43.issue-6/issuetoc" target="_self">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/idsb.2012.43.issue-6/issuetoc</a></p>

					<p>The Platform for African-European Partnership in Agricultural Research for Development (PAEPARD) features analysis of smallholders’ influence on priority setting in agricultural research activities and raises a number of questions about why the inclusion of farmers, particularly resource-poor farmers, in foresight (and in ARD processes generally) has so far been limited. Expressing the views of INSARD (Including Smallholders in Agricultural Research for Development) consortium, this post explains how ‘the problem’ of lack of inclusion is perceived and how this affects the solutions proposed.Lack of capacity in civil society organisations (CSOs), lack of true democratic representation of (very diverse) farming communities, and lack of accountability and awareness of researchers towards farmers, rural people and poor consumers are the main obstacles keeping smallholders away from ARD priority setting. Further explaining these last obstacles, the author suggests that ‘rather than farmers and CSOs building their capacity to speak the language of researchers, the research organisations have a responsibility to consult and account for their work in ways that make sense for farmers.(PAEPARD, 01/11/2012)<a href="http://paepard.blogspot.nl/2012/11/insard-gcard-voices-of-smallholders-in.html" target="_self">http://paepard.blogspot.nl/2012/11/insard-gcard-voices-of-smallholders-in.html</a>INSARD: <a href="http://www.repaoc.org/insard" target="_self">http://www.repaoc.org/insard</a></p>

	The lack of regional small-scale feed manufacturing plants, high cost of imported feed and cheap imports are holding back the development of the smallholder poultry sector in Pacific countries. As there are adequate supplies in some regions of locally produced feed ingredients (cassava, sweet potato, coconut, maize), the prospect for alternative feedstuffs is in the semi-commercial or family poultry units. For these sectors, profitability rather than maximum production is the objective, and alternative feedstuffs can make a useful contribution in poultry feeding.In his article, Glatz examines four feeding strategies to produce effective poultry rations that are in line with the regional availability of feed resources. With a complete ration formulation using local ingredients, egg production was significantly lower in birds fed the local mix ration compared to the commercial ration. Testing free-choice feeding, the birds showed the capacity to regulate their intake according to their physiological requirements, provided that the three food groups were readily available. Using a mix of concentrate with local ingredients, birds fed a 50/50 sweet potato / low-energy concentrate or a 50/50 cassava / high-energy concentrate diets were able to reach market weight in due time. A 70/30 sweet potato / low-energy concentrate diet was effective only in the more suitable environment of the Western Province of PNG. Diluting commercial broiler finisher with 20-40% copra meal resulted in similar growth as the 100% broiler finisher control diet (inclusion of 60% copra meal resulted in somewhat less acceptable growth).&nbsp;Poultry farming in the Pacific using local feeds can be competitive and achieve 30% feed cost savings when mini-mill equipment is readily available and small-scale regional feed manufacturing centres (producing 5-10 tonnes/week) are built where local feed supply is plentiful.</p>

					<p>This book authored by the Committee on Women in Science, Engineering, and Medicine (CWSEM), of the US National Research Council) is the summary of an August 2009 workshop that assesses the current status of women undertaking entrepreneurial activity in technical fields, to better understand the nature of the barriers they encounter, and to identify what it takes for women scientists and engineers to succeed as entrepreneurs.This report focuses on women's career transitions from academic science and engineering to entrepreneurship, with a goal of identifying knowledge gaps in women's skills as well as experiences crucial to future success in business and critical for achieving leadership positions in entrepreneurial organisations. From Science to Business makes the case that in addition to educating women scientists and engineers in rigorous problem solving, it is equally important to provide exposure and training to impart the skills that will enable more women to move from the role of expert to that of leader in dynamic new business enterprises. This book will be of interest to professionals in both academia and industry, graduate and post-graduate students, and organisations that advocate for a stronger economy.(<a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13392" target="_blank">NAP</a>, 2012)</p>

					<p>The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has concluded that a recent paper conducted by Séralini <i>et al.</i> concerning the potential toxicity of genetically modified (GM) maize NK603 and a herbicide containing glyphosate is of insufficient scientific quality. Séralini and his team at France's University of Caen had found that rats developed tumors when fed the corn, or when exposed to weedkillers containing glyphosate. The EFSA set up a multi-disciplinary task force in response to an urgent request from the European Commission to evaluate the paper and assess whether the findings could lead the Authority to reconsider its previous opinion on the maize NK603.The initial review found the design, reporting and analysis of the study to be inadequate. The EFSA has invited the authors to share key additional information in order to enable the fullest understanding of the study, but, at this time, is unable to regard the authors' conclusions as scientifically sound. A second analysis of the study will be delivered by the end of October 2012, and will take into account any additional information from the study authors. EFSA's current position is that it does not see a need to re-examine its previous safety evaluation of maize NK603, nor consider these findings in the ongoing assessment of glyphosate.(<a href="http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/121004.htm" target="_blank">EFSA</a>, 4/10/2012)</p>

Those who sample the variables to obtain the necessary data need guidance on the design and analysis of sampling methods for their conclusions and recommendations to be valid.<a href="http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9781849713689" target="_blank">This book</a> provides that guidance, backed by sound rationale and statistical theory. It concentrates on design-based sampling for estimates of mean values of environmental properties, emphasizing replication and randomization. It starts with simple random sampling and then progresses to more efficient designs, such as spatially stratified random sampling, stratification by classes and cluster sampling. It includes a section on purposive sampling in classical soil survey, which is relevant to other environmental properties such as vegetation. It also describes the effects of bulking on errors and the use of ancillary information and regression to improve estimates.The authors draw the important distinction between design-based sampling for estimating means and model-based methods (geostatistics) for local spatial prediction and mapping, and focus on the latter. They describe designs suitable for computing variograms and prediction by kriging, as well as a staged approach, so that sampling is neither inadequate nor excessive, and designs adapt as knowledge is accumulated. Including numerous worked case studies of sampling in agriculture, ecology and environmental science, the book will be of immediate practical value.(<a href="http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9781849713689" target="_blank">Routledge</a>, 2012)</p>

					<p>The scientific community has an essential role to play in informing concurrent, strategic investments to establish climate-resilient agricultural production systems, minimize greenhouse gas emissions, make efficient use of resources, develop low-waste supply chains, ensure adequate nutrition, encourage healthy eating choices and develop a global knowledge system for sustainability.This paper outlines scientific contributions that will be essential to the seven policy recommendations for achieving food security in the context of climate change put forward by the Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change. These include improved understanding of agriculture's vulnerability to climate change, food price dynamics, food waste and consumption patterns and monitoring technologies as well as multidisciplinary investigation of regionally appropriate responses to climate change and food security challenges.(<a href="http://www.agricultureandfoodsecurity.com/content/1/1/10" target="_blank"><i>Agriculture &amp; Food Security</i></a>. 07/2012.

It advocates for a social vulnerability lens to food insecurity and climate change.The report stresses that low-carbon or climate smart agricultural practices should be pursued. As recommendations, it calls among others, for: policies and programmes to integrate food security and climate change concerns; increasing resilience through activities including basing adaptation measures on assessments of risks and vulnerabilities, exchange of practices, weather forecasting tools, and increasing farmer access to financial services.(<a href="http://africasd.iisd.org/news/panel-on-food-security-and-nutrition-release-report-on-food-security-and-climate-change/" target="_blank">IISD Reporting Services</a>, 4/7/2012)</p>

					<p>Classical risk assessment approaches for animal diseases are influenced by the probability of release, exposure and consequences of a hazard affecting a livestock population. Once a pathogen enters into domestic livestock, potential risks of exposure and infection both to animals and people extend through a chain of economic activities related to producing, buying and selling of animals and products. Therefore, in order to understand economic drivers of animal diseases in different ecosystems and to come up with effective and efficient measures to manage disease risks from a country or region, the entire value chain and related markets for animal and product needs to be analysed to come out with practical and cost effective risk management options agreed by actors and players on those value chains.Value chain analysis enriches disease risk assessment providing a framework for interdisciplinary collaboration, which seems to be in increasing demand for problems concerning infectious livestock diseases. The best way to achieve this is to ensure that veterinary epidemiologists and social scientists work together throughout the process at all levels.(<a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/014/i2198e/i2198e00.htm" target="_blank">Taylor <i>et al.</i></a>, FAO, 2011)</p>

					<p><i>Jägerskog, A., Jønch Clausen, T. (eds.) 2012. Feeding a Thirsty World – Challenges and Opportunities for a Water and Food Secure Future. Report Nr. 31. SIWI, Stockholm.&nbsp;</i>This report provided input into the discussions at the 2012 World Water Week in Stockholm, under the theme of Water and Food Security. It features brief overviews of new knowledge and approaches on emerging and persistent challenges to achieve water and food security in the 21st century. Each chapter focuses on critical issues that have received less attention in the literature to date, such as: food waste, land acquisitions, gender aspects of agriculture, and early warning systems for agricultural emergencies. The analysis showed that there will not be enough water available on current croplands to produce food for the expected population in 2050 if we follow current trends and changes towards diets common in Western nations. The researchers found that industrialized nations currently get on average 20 percent of calories from animal protein (meat plus other products like milk and eggs). To produce the grain necessary to maintain that level and take it worldwide by 2050, farmers would need more usable water than the planet is capable of providing. What level would work, according to the researchers? There will be ‘just enough water’, they conclude, ‘if the proportion of animal-based foods is limited to 5 percent of total calories’. In other words, we non-vegans need to prepare ourselves and our children for radically different diets in the coming decades – eating about a quarter of the meat, eggs, cheese, etc we now do. Rather than relying heavily on animals for protein, we'll have to learn to consume much more of what we now feed animals: legumes and grains.Report:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.siwi.org/documents/Resources/Reports/Feeding_a_thirsty_world_2012worldwaterweek_report_31.pdf" target="_self">http://www.siwi.org/documents/Resources/Reports/Feeding_a_thirsty_world_2012worldwaterweek_report_31.pdf</a>Commentary: <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2012/08/want-avoid-thirsty-future-eat-less-meat" target="_self">http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2012/08/want-avoid-thirsty-future-eat-less-meat</a></p>

					<p>Germany's National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina has come down firmly against the use of crops for energy. In a <a href="http://www.leopoldina.org/en/publications/detailview/?publication[publication]=434&amp;cHash=9daf8d722e71e30bf2901cf01ee800d1" target="_blank">report</a> issued by a panel of more than 20 experts who have been working together since 2010, the academy concludes that biofuels should play only a small part in the move toward sustainable sources of energy. Biofuels use more land area, generate more greenhouse gas emissions, and have a greater impact on the environment than other alternative energy sources such as photovoltaic solar energy, solar thermal energy, or wind power. Biofuel crops may also find themselves competing with food crops for valuable land.(<a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/07/german-researchers-hand-biofuels.html" target="_blank"><i>Science</i>Insider</a>, 26/7/2012)</p>
