						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Different perspectives on the inter-relationships between science, technology and innovation (ST&amp;I), the multiple dimensions of development (ecological, economic, social and cultural) and of sustainability (economic, environmental and social) are explored. In addition to outlining underlying scientific concepts and detailing the change of paradigm in ST&amp;I policy over the past decades, Anna Schwachula of the Centre for Development Research, at the University of Bonn, Germany (ZEF) and co-authors note the complexity of analysing the potential impacts of ST&amp;I on society and propose three scientific models. The authors focused on how the OECD, World Bank and UNESCO defined and operationalised ST&amp;I for development and conclude that by emphasising the economic aspects of developments, social and environmental dimensions are side-lined. The lack of institution-wide consensus on key concepts is observed and they caution against applying a universal blueprint. A call js made for a discussion of a broader range of conceptualisations and pathways along the science-policy interface to determine to what extent these could be used for developing countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;(ZEF, 06/2014)</p>

					<p>The paper revisits Africa's agricultural input landscape, exploiting the recently collected, nationally representative, agriculturally intensive, and cross-country comparable Living Standard Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture, covering six countries (Ethiopia, Malawi, Niger, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda). &nbsp;The most striking and important findings are distilled into 10 key takeaway descriptive results which show that: modern agricultural input use has picked up to a significant level in some regions within some countries, especially in the case of inorganic fertilizer and agro-chemical use; the incidence of irrigation and mechanisation remains quite small; there is surprisingly low correlation between the use of commonly 'paired' modern inputs at the household- and plot-level; maize-dominated plots exhibit higher rates of input use intensity, even relative to plots planted with cash crops; there exists a consistent inverse relationship between farm or plot size and input use intensity; farmers do not significantly vary input application rates according to perceived soil quality; few households use credit to purchase modern inputs. &nbsp;&nbsp;(World Bank, 09/2014)</p>

					<p>Around a quarter of total food wastage in developing countries could be eliminated if these countries adopted the same level of refrigeration equipment as that in developed economies according to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IME), London, UK. Establishing a continuous chain of temperature-controlled cold environments from the point of harvest to the marketplace and on into the home – a ‘cold chain’ – is required. The challenge for the engineering profession is to do this in a way which minimises food wastage, is sustainable and avoids harmful emissions and air pollutants. In summary, engineers need to help establish sustainable and resilient infrastructure, fit for purpose in the local context. Two elements are important; firstly, projects need to be affordable; secondly they must be safe, reliable, easy to build, operate and maintain. &nbsp;&nbsp;(FoodProduction daily.com, 30/06/2014)</p>

					<p>Results of a 2012 survey show that quantitative post-harvest losses of economic importance occur in the field (15%); during processing (13-20%), and during storage (15-25%) in semi-arid savannah areas of Tanzania. Farmers’ poor knowledge and skills on post-harvest management are considered to be largely responsible. According to the farmers, changes in weather (40%), field damage (33%), and storage pests, grain borers and grain weevils (16%) were identified as the three most important factors causing poor crop yields and aggravating food losses. Increasing farmers’ technical know-how on adaptation of the farming systems to climate variability, and training on post-harvest management could reduce food losses, and poverty and improve household food security.

					<p>Teff is widely cultivated and used in Ethiopia and accounts for about a quarter of the country’s cereal production. However, its use for human consumption in other countries is limited due to a lack of knowledge about its nutrient composition and processing. In this study, Kaleab Baye, at the Center for Food Science and Nutrition, Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia describes the physical and chemical characteristics of Teff and its nutrient composition. He documents the use of Teff and Teff-based products for human nutrition in Ethiopia, along with the food processing challenges impeding Teff’s worldwide consumption. Baye discusses how recent research advances could solve the challenges in the production of the little-known cereal and what the potential health benefits could be associated with wider consumption of Teff. &nbsp; &nbsp;(IFPRI and EDRI, 09/2014)</p>

					<p>The report <i>Status and Trends of Caribbean Coral Reefs: 1970-2012</i> is the most detailed and comprehensive study of its kind published to date and represents the work of 90 experts over the course of three years. It contains an analysis of more than 35,000 surveys conducted at 90 Caribbean locations since 1970, including studies of corals, seaweeds, grazing sea urchins and fish. The results show that the Caribbean corals have declined by more than 50% since the 1970s. But according to the authors, restoring parrotfish populations and improving other management strategies, such as protection from overfishing and excessive coastal pollution, could help the reefs recover and make them more resilient to future climate change impacts. This latest report was produced by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network (GCRMN), the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). &nbsp;<a href="http://caribbeanclimateblog.com/2014/07/02/coral-reefs-report-and-climate-change-news/" target="_self">http://caribbeanclimateblog.com/2014/07/02/coral-reefs-report-and-climate-change-news/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.iucn.org/?uNewsID=16056" target="_self">http://www.iucn.org/?uNewsID=16056</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Report: <a href="http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/caribbean_coral_reefs___status_report_1970_2012.pdf" target="_self">http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/caribbean_coral_reefs___status_report_1970_2012.pdf</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(Caribbean Climate Blog, 07/2014)</p>

					<p>A fishing trip analysis shows that catch and profitability are higher when public fish aggregation devices (FADs) are managed privately or by small groups and access to the aggregated fisheries resources is somewhat restricted. In partnership with Counterpart International, the Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism, the Dominica and St. Vincent and the Grenadines Fisheries Divisions and the Florida Sea Grant collected information from fishermen on their use of FADs that were deployed privately, by small groups or by the government. This allowed for a determination of governance arrangements that were most profitable and provided input to stakeholder meetings with FAD fishers to identify best practices for sustainably using and co-managing FADs. An engagement strategy that introduced an activity planner as a best practice to increase information sharing helped strengthen the rapport between government and fisheries stakeholders. &nbsp;&nbsp;(CRFM, 07/10/2014)</p>

					<p>This book clarifies the challenges, issues, and priorities of agricultural education and training (AET) in sub-Saharan Africa, and provides suggestions for practical solutions that can help guide organisations interested in furthering AET for agricultural development. Edited by Frans Swanepoel of Stellenbosch University, South Africa and colleagues, &quot;<i>Towards Impact &amp; Resilience: Transformative Change In and Through Agricultural Education and Training in Africa</i>&quot;<i> </i>discusses (i) the African context within which a transformed AET system needs to be located; (ii) analyses African and international experiences that are relevant to identified AET needs and challenges; (iii) dissects AET models that may hold important lessons; and (iv) addresses the main critical issues that will impact upon AET in sub-Saharan Africa. The concluding chapter synthesises the ideas, experiences, and evidence from the preceding chapters in order to highlight critical issues for success as well as possible solutions. The publication is uniquely positioned to add to a call to action on AET, to pull together state-of-the-art knowledge from within and outside sub-Saharan Africa, and to advance 'out of the box' thinking about the principles, values and character of AET for development. &nbsp;&nbsp;(Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2014)</p>

					<p>The Africa Agriculture Status Report 2014 (AASR) presents a comprehensive overview of smallholder agriculture in Africa and provides foresight for the planning of a 'climate-smart agricultural’ (CSA) sector on the continent. The first part of the report that was published by the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, focuses on climate variability and change, its impacts on agriculture, the need for adaptation to improve resilience, mitigation issues, and the factors influencing the adoption of climate-smart practices. The second part maps, on the basis of new research, the regions at highest risk for more ‘failed seasons’ as rainfall become more erratic. This part also contains a compilation of micro- and macro-agriculture data tables from selected SSA countries that show trends in agricultural data and climate-related variables. Recommended solution-oriented actions include: (i) promote climate-smart, context-driven agro-ecological approaches and solutions; (ii) strengthen national and local institutions; (iii) build technical capacity and improve knowledge management systems; (iv) raise the level of national investments in agriculture; and (v) create innovative financing mechanisms. &nbsp; &nbsp;(AGRA, 08/2014)</p>

					<p>The integration of three state-of-the-art technologies such that scientific findings and data are linked to actual user requirements including governments to achieve better decision-support for agricultural drought preparedness, has been proposed by Markus Enenkel, Vienna University of Technology, Austria and colleagues. Several promising approaches, ranging from the integration of satellite-derived soil moisture measurements that link atmospheric processes to anomalies on the land surface to improved long-range weather predictions and mobile applications are explored. Satellite-derived soil moisture measurements from space-based microwave sensors can help detect plant water deficiencies earlier than conventional products such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and forecasting models can provide seasonal predictions. These models must be calibrated to regional conditions, take into account weather uncertainties and 'hindsight' data, and be combined with crop health predictions. Mobile applications can link end users to drought-relevant information and also play a vital role in validating satellite-derived drought indicators and collecting socio-economic conditions. According to the authors, the added value of these technologies should create enough political will to ensure they find their way into the decision-support toolboxes of the end users. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Global Food Security</i>, 10/09/2014)</p>

By following these principles, governments could unlock renewable energy technology deployment at lowest cost and also enhance technology driven economic growth and exports. The report prepared by the Carbon Trust and supported by Element Energy, involved extensive input through workshops and interviews with leading international policymakers and industry experts. &nbsp;&nbsp;(IEA-RETD, 09/2014)</p>

					<p>Norman Clark, John Mugabe, and James Smith provide an analytical context of biotechnology and biosafety in three African countries by reviewing the nature of science policy research, especially as it applies to potential developmental impacts of biotechnology. The book throws new light on biotechnology governance in Kenya, South Africa and Uganda that have been struggling with biotechnology development and related biosafety policy and pays attention to experiences in OECD countries. In addition, the authors pay close attention to the analysis of risk and how it may be managed. They discuss the flawed nature of traditional approaches to biosafety management (treating biosafety risks as reducible to probabilistic values) and argue that these approaches are not only invalid from a purely scientific point of view, but also fail to deal with attitudes of civil society. They think that it is largely for these reasons that the 'precautionary principle' has begun to be taken seriously. &nbsp;&nbsp;(Africa Portal, 09/2014)</p>

					<p>The value, relevance, quality, fairness, and flexibility of the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) and its success in advancing innovations and competitiveness in the U.S. food and agriculture system are assessed in this report. AFRI is one of the mechanisms the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has been funding to support research. Conclusions state that AFRI (i) has not been adequately given the resources needed to meet contemporary and future challenges; (ii) is unnecessarily complex, difficult to depict clearly, and characterised by overlapping components that do not clearly align with set priorities; and (iii) does not have clearly articulated plans to guide its priority-setting, management processes, and interagency collaboration. Finally, AFRI’s complex and diffuse management structure has made it difficult to efficiently and effectively manage the programme.

					<p>Ewan Robinson of IDS, UK and colleagues from Sokoine University of Agriculture, Tanzania analyse policies and interventions to improve the functioning of markets that deliver nutrient-dense foods. They analyse five broad strategies – voluntary fortification, mandatory fortification, promoting fresh foods, non-profit distribution, behaviour change communication – and describe what mechanisms can be used to address market constraints such as enforcement, supply quality, distribution costs, signalling, and awareness raising. No single strategy can address all constraints completely but different interventions can address some and benefit certain populations. Programme-specific recommendations are put forward; for example, the promotion of nutrient-dense fresh foods must distinguish between pre-farm-gate and post-farm-gate consumption and related policies should support the production of neglected nutrient-dense crops. &nbsp;&nbsp;(IDS UK, 19/08/2014)</p>

					<p>Culture-based gender differences, nomadic versus sedentary practices, language differences, and biodiversity – are important issues in international research agreements that involve genetic resources. This was the finding of the working group on agriculture and animal issues during the 2013 July workshop 'Culture Matters: An Approach to International Research Agreements' convened by the Government-University-Industry Research Roundtable (GUIRR, U.S.-based) when representatives from government, university, and industry from around the world – gathered to address how culture and cultural perception influence and impact the process by which research agreements are made and negotiated across international boundaries. Subjects included: 'Conducting Research in Developing Countries' and 'Intellectual Property' across four specific domains: (i) research and agreements affecting or involving people/human subjects; (ii) environmental and natural resources; (iii) science, engineering, and manufacturing; and (iv) agriculture and animal issues. This report summarises the proceedings of the workshop. &nbsp; &nbsp;(NAP, 08/2014)</p>
