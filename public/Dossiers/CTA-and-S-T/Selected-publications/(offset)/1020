						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>By Olivier De Schutter, UN Human Rights Council, 8 September 2008. The marked increase of the prices of food commodities on the international markets in the period 2006-2008 confronts States with a number of dilemmas, related for instance to whether the price increases should be combated or actions taken instead to ensure that those increases benefit agricultural producers and do not have a negative impact on the most vulnerable, or to the conditions under which agrofuels could be developed as an alternative to fossil fuels in the transport sector. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food highlights the impact of the choices to be made on the right to food, placing them in the framework of States’ obligations domestically and internationally. He suggests why a human rights framework should be adopted in order both to identify the measures needed to respond to the new situation created by the surge in prices and to guide their implementation. Listing both the risks and the opportunities of the current situation, the Special Rapporteur explains why continued monitoring of initiatives adopted at the national and international levels to respond to the crisis is required.</p>

					<p>By Regine Andersen, Fridtjof Nansen Institute, Norway, Ashgate, ISBN: 978-0-7546-4741-6, August 2008. Plant genetic diversity is crucial to the breeding of food crops and is therefore a central precondition for food security. Diverse genetic resources provide the genetic traits required to deal with crop pests and diseases, as well as changing climate conditions. Plant genetic diversity is also essential for traditional small-scale farming, and is therefore an indispensable factor in the fight against poverty. However, the diversity of domesticated plant varieties is disappearing at an alarming rate while interest in the commercial use of genetic resources has increased in line with bio-technologies, followed by demands for intellectual property rights. This important book contributes to our understanding of how international regimes affect the management of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture in developing countries. It identifies entry points to shape a better governance of agrobiodiversity and provides the first comprehensive analysis of how the international agreements pertaining to crop genetic resources affect the management of these vital resources for food security and poverty eradication in developing countries. </p>

					<p>
The CBD’s Business Newsletter focuses on agrobiodiversity. “Agricultural biodiversity” is a broad term that includes all components of biological diversity of relevance to food and agriculture. It also includes all components of biological diversity that support the ecosystems of which agriculture is a part (agro-ecosystems): the variety and variability of animals, plants and micro-organisms, at the genetic, species and ecosystem levels, which are necessary to sustain key functions of the agro-ecosystem, its structure and processes. The issue of Business.2010 is released as a contribution to SBSTTA-13 which will be considering, amongst other agenda items, the in-depth review of the implementation of the Programme of Work on Agricultural Biodiversity. This is also fitting, given that the theme of the International Biodiversity Day, this year, is ‘agriculture and biodiversity’. In the centre pages of this issue, the first edition of a guide to business-related events at COP-9 is compiled, which also includes an overview of pre-COP business related events. </p>

					<p>UK FOOD GROUP, 2008. Aid to African agriculture is back on the international policy agenda in the context of climate change, the current food and energy price crises and the consequent demands for hundreds of billions of dollars in new investment in agriculture. African governments have committed to allocate 10 per cent of GDP to agriculture. Many international processes are now focusing on agriculture including the third High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, and many processes of the United Nations (United Nations, 2008). These will have the opportunity to decide how to provide more aid to agriculture, especially in Africa. The big question is how much will be available in practice, for what type of investment and for whose benefit? Will increased aid for African agriculture actually benefit small-scale farmers in the long-term? ‘If agriculture has a final frontier, it is Africa. After agriculture transformations in Asia and Latin America since the 1960s, Africa remains the one place where the farming potential has barely been scratched. African agriculture has less irrigation, less fertilizer use, less soil and seed research, less mechanization, less rural financing, fewer paved farm-to-market roads than any other farming region in the world.’ Aid to agriculture, especially in Africa, is belatedly on the increase. Nonetheless, concerns remain about the apparently ubiquitous macroeconomic approach, promoted by the donor community, to rural poverty reduction and the type of agriculture it supports.</p>

By Frank Hartwich, Jaime Tola, Alejandra Engler, Carolina González, Graciela Ghezan, Jorge M. P. Vázquez-Alvarado, José Antonio Silva, José de Jesús Espinoza, and María Verónica Gottret, IFPRI, 2008. Public–private partnerships are a new way of carrying out research and development (R&amp;D) in Latin America’s agricultural sector. These partnerships spur innovation foragricultural development and have various advantages over other institutional arrangements fostering R&amp;D. This report summarizes the experiences of a research project that analyzed 125 public–private research partnerships (PPPs) in 12 Latin American countries. The analysis indicates that several types of partnerships have emerged in response to the various needs of the different partners. Nevertheless, public–private partnerships are not always the most appropriate mechanism by which to carry out R&amp;D and foster innovation in agriculture. Sometimes, it is more efficient to organize research via participatory projects or through research contracts. </p>

FAO Focus: Women and Food Security. On the eve of the 21st century, rural women in developing countries hold the key to the future of the Earth's agricultural systems and to food and livelihood security through their roles in the selection of seed, the management of small livestock and the conservation and sustainable use of plant and animal diversity. Rural women's key role as food providers and food producers links them directly to the management of genetic resources for food and agriculture and has given them unique knowledge of local species, ecosystems and their use acquired from centuries of practical experience. The poorest farming communities are those that live in marginal and heterogeneous environments that have benefited least from modern high-yielding plant varieties. Up to 90 percent of the planting material of such farmers may be derived from the seeds and germplasm that they produce, select and save themselves.Such subsistence farmers cannot afford external inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides, veterinary products, high quality feeds and fuel for cooking and heating. They rely on maintaining a wide diversity of crops and wild plants and animal breeds and strains that are adapted to the local environment in order to protect against crop failure and animal disease or death, to provide a continuous and varied food supply and to ward against hunger and malnutrition. In many areas, the majority of smallholder farmers are women.</p>

By Kavita Gupta, J.L. Karihaloo and R.K. Khetarpal, Published by the Asia-Pacific Association of Agricultural Research Institutions Asia-Pacific Consortium on Agricultural Biotechnology and the FAO, 2008. World population is expected to increase from the current 6.3 to 7.5 billion by 2020 (IDB, 2007). Asia-Pacific region, being home to nearly 60% of the world’s population, is expected to contribute significantly to this increase. While spectacular rise in food production was made especially in Asia during 1970s and 1980s, the recent years have seen a slow down or even stagnation, raising concerns about food and livelihood security in the developing countries. Several countries are increasingly resorting to imports either because domestic production is too low or because there are growing demands for food and feed grain. It is predicted that developing countries in Asia will account for half of the increase in global demand for the cereals by the year 2020 (Rosegrant et al., 2001). It is also being felt that under the prevailing conditions, most of the developing countries in Asia and the Pacific will be unable to meet the Millennium Development Goals of halving poverty and hunger by 2015 (UNESCAP, 2005). Biotechnology1 is globally recognized as a powerful tool of plant and animal genetic modification (GM) that holds promise of improving productivity, profitability and sustainability of farm production systems, including those existing in small and poor farming situations (Cohen,2005; Delmer, 2005; Brookes and Barfoot, 2006). The present chapter details the status of Asia-Pacific countries on adoption and research in genetically modified (GM) crops.</p>

					<p>By Roger Konrad, Natalie Ferry, Angharad M. R. Gatehouse, Dirk Babendreier, 16 July 2008. Genetically modified (GM) crops expressing proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are cultivated on a rapidly increasing acreage worldwide since their commercialization in the mid 1990s, and, with the exception of cotton expressing both Bt and CpTI (serine protease inhibitor from cowpea), are the only insect-resistant GM plants to have been brought to the marketplace. However, various strategies based on the use of plant or animal derived genes are actively being pursued. A major concern raised in connection with the cultivation of transgenic plants is their potential to harm beneficial insects such as bees. By pollinating wild and cultivated plants, bees make a significant contribution to the functioning of natural ecosystems and to the human food supply. Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) are regarded as the most economically important pollinators of agricultural crops worldwide. However, solitary bees (both wild and managed) also provide an important pollination service and their value for agriculture is increasingly being recognized. This is particularly true for areas and crops where honey bees are absent or are inefficient pollinators, and under these conditions non-Apis bees can substantially enhance production. In the late 1950s, the use of non-Apis bees (i.e. the two solitary bees Nomia melanderi Cockerell and Megachile rotundata Fabricius) started to become important in commercial pollination. Since then, several solitary bee species (mainly members of the genus Osmia) have been developed into manageable crop pollinators and have often been found to contribute to higher crop yields than honey bees (e.g.).</p>

The book was edited by Jörg Romeis (Agroscope ART, Switzerland), Anthony Shelton (Cornell University, USA) and George Kennedy (North Carolina State University, USA) with the goal of providing an overview of the role insect-resistant GM plants play in different crop systems worldwide. A total of 42 authors from around the globe have reviewed the latest available information on insect-resistant GM crops, ranging from their biological and ecological activity to their economic and social impact. The editors hope the book will contribute to a more rational debate about the role GM crops can play in IPM for food and fiber production.</p>

					<p>By Catherine Saez, Intellectual Property Watch, 7 August 2008. As the world struggles with a global food crisis, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) is working to support biodiversity as a way to contribute to food security. To that end, the FAO has launched an initiative to ensure that this global genetic diversity is accessible, in the hopes that this will promote sustainable agriculture and increased food security. The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, which addresses the need for diversity by promoting conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (PGRFA) and equitable sharing of benefits derived from their use, was adopted by the FAO Conference in November 2001 and it came into force in June 2004. The treaty aims at collecting and sharing global plant genetic resources to sponsor genetic diversity and ensure food security. Its main components are: farmers’ rights, the multilateral system of access and benefit sharing, and a funding strategy.</p>

					<p>
European Crop Protection Association, 27 August 2008. There is a rapid growth in Europe and worldwide of counterfeit and illegally-traded pesticides. These illegal products are produced and distributed by criminal gangs. They are untested, unregulated and threaten farmers and consumers health and the environment.
The scale and scope of counterfeit pesticides differs from market to market depending on countries’ specificities. This report gives a detailed overview of the problem and solutions. It provides useful and insightful information on the overall problem as well as for a number of European countries. Fighting counterfeit pesticides is a complex task. In Europe, we see the dichotomy of more and more regulation related to pesticide use, yet less and less attention devoted to enforcement of these regulations. This is leading to more and more abuse.The grave nature of the problem requires urgent actions by all stakeholders – governments, supranational entities, farmers and food chain and the legitimate pesticide industry.</p>

By Alfred Watkins and Michael Ehst (Eds) World Bank 2008. This report is based on the proceedings of the Global Forum on Building Science, Technology, and Innovation Capacity for Sustainable Growth and Poverty Reduction (February 2007). The report presents the cases from this Forum and captures the lessons from the STI capacity building experiences of both developing and industrial countries––governments working in partnership with the private sector, nongovernmental organizations, academia, and development partners. These cases highlight ways that STI capacity building programs have enabled countries to achieve provision of essential services, such as access to clean drinking water in rural villages and availability of affordable, reliable energy sources; the exploitations of opportunities to produce higher-productivity, value-added agriculture crops; the transitions from exporting unprocessed raw materials to exporting value-added products and from low-skilled assembly operations to higher-skilled manufacturing processes; the creation of benefits from an increasingly open trading system and increased flows of foreign direct investment by proactively generating spill overs to the local economy; and the maintenance of competitiveness in a rapidly changing global economy marked by rapid technological change.</p>

					<p>
New Agriculturalist, July 2008. The rapid rise in food prices, particularly for grain, has left many poor people at risk from hunger, and for the first time since the 1970s, the world is consuming more than it produces. At the recent World Food Summit, the UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, stated that food output needs to rise by 50 per cent by 2030. His call is echoed by his predecessor, Kofi Annan, now chair of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, who is demanding greater investment in agriculture across the continent. Achieving an African green revolution will be harder and more complex than the green revolution in Asia and a one-size-fits-all approach will not work. Technology alone will also not provide the answers. In this edition of New Agriculturist, we review a selection of approaches with a potential for raising agricultural productivity in Africa.</p>

					<p>
By Liangzhi You and Michael Johnson, IFPRI Discussion Paper. 776, July 2008. Agriculture plays a dominant role in nearly all the countries of East and Central Africa, and many face similar agroecological, climatic, and development challenges. As a result, significant scale economies can be made through the regionalization of research and development (R&amp;D) using networks such as the Association for Strengthening Agricultural Research in Eastern and Central Africa. The challenge for such networks, however, is to determine both regional and national research priorities with the highest potential rates of economic return. Methodology to assess regional research priorities is a critical input into this process, particularly when it comes to weighing likely complementarities among individual research programs, thus maximizing impact across countries at the regional level. Dynamic Research Evaluation for Management (Dream) is applied to the East and Central African region to estimate potential economic and technological spillovers from country- and regional-level R&amp;D investments for select commodities based on future projections of supply and demand, trade flows between countries and world markets, and shared agroecologies and farming systems. </p>

					<p>
By Andy Sumner, Johanna Lindstrom and Lawrence Haddad, id21 insights 73, July 2008. The high world food prices that we are currently experiencing provide a chilling reminder of the vulnerability of large parts of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia to hunger and undernutrition. Many children in these regions are vulnerable to poor growth, poor development and death. Underinvestment in interventions to improve nutrition is due to a lack of incentives for donors; few take a strategic approach to investments that have the potential to improve nutrition and they have little idea whether current investments are making a difference. The nutrition of the world’s children and women desperately needs improving. Failure to do so violates their human rights and will undermine development today and in the next generation.</p>

					<p>The July-issue of I4d is completely devoted to the role of women in the ICT4D domain. Gender has not been on the conscious agenda of the ICT4D domain area. It is not therefore unusual for development programmes to be conceptualised without taking into consideration the key or special needs of women. Even when development programmes have addressed access issues, like the telecentres, infrastructure development, etc they have been put in place with a concern for reaching the unreached, but not necessarily developed with gender sensitive designs, or bearing in mind the language and social needs of women. With the advent of new technologies for communications, be it the telephones or mobiles, or computers, there has been a slow but steady uptake of the technologies by women. Wherever women’s organisations have consciously designed programmes to suit the specific needs of women, they have created new opportunities for empowerment, improvement in livelihoods, and overall well being of the families that women nurture.</p>
