						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Algeria has launched a start-up initiative called ASI to help university graduates and hi-tech entrepreneurs transfer ideas into innovative information and communications technology-based enterprises in the hope of establishing a Silicon Valley-style innovation zone and a &quot;Google - made in Algeria&quot;. ASI is part of the 'e-Algeria 2013' strategy that aims to connect Algeria to the information society and knowledge-based economy. The plan was announced at the Conference on the Creation of Start-ups which was organised by the National Agency for the Promotion and Development of Technology, the US-Algeria Business Council and Algerian business leaders based in California. ASI is intended to speed up the use of ICT in enterprises, develop mechanisms and incentive measures enabling access to equipment and ICT networks, and to develop skilled human resources.

	Renowned for their inter-island trade, Pacific Islanders are struggling to participate in global markets. Geographically remote, with small populations and economies, the islands cannot hope to compete with countries like China and India in the export of bulk agricultural goods. However, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community's FACT project - Facilitating Agricultural Commodity Trade - is working to support small companies to benefit from the export of high-value, low-volume goods. Running for just over a year, with support from the EU, the project is currently working with 14 companies in six Pacific countries. One disadvantage for Pacific Island export products, in climate change-sensitive times, is the air miles they cannot avoid accumulating. But FACT hopes to counter this with agroforestry schemes that offset the carbon footprint of the products. The FACT project will make a big difference in the coming years to the small Pacific Island companies it is helping. But there remain problems concerning the long term, as successful entrepreneurs (and their children) tend to leave the islands. The answer could be to support the mostly family-run companies to develop more sustainable corporate structures. (Source: New Agriculturalist, November 2009)</p>

					<p>With heavy rain already beginning to flood parts of East Africa, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has warned that further El Niño rains could compound the humanitarian crisis caused by drought. Kenya, Somalia, and Uganda are those most at risk of flooding, mudslides, crop destruction and water-borne diseases which could see up to 750,000 affected. But due to the severity of the drought, rains are desperately needed in order to prevent further crop failure and help pastures regenerate. For pastoralists, migration in search of water and pasture has exacerbated conflict and led to increased disease outbreaks. This, in turn, has killed a large number of livestock and reduced the market value of those still alive due to their poor physical condition. In addition, poor harvests due to the lack of rainfall have been compounded by high food prices. Twenty million people in the region are already dependent on food aid, but as the hunger season progresses, the UN warn that this number is likely to increase.

					<p>At the beginning of this year, three different banana diseases were attacking East Africa, devastating farms around the region and exacerbating the prevailing food crisis. To help prevent the spread of such diseases, it is vital that smallholder farmers have access to comprehensive information about crop conditions in the region. As it is, such information is often incomplete or unavailable. The agricultural challenges in Uganda are numerous, but the country’s agricultural scientists now have the potential to confront some of the obstacles that smallholder farmers are facing. An AGCommons Quick Win Project (Community Level Crop Disease Surveillance), which was part of the much larger Community Knowledge Worker (CKW) Project being implemented by the Grameen Foundation, has played a small but valuable role in testing a mobile crop monitoring system that will ultimately allow research institutions to target data collection and interact directly with smallholder farmers in the field. AGCommons spoke with Whitney Gantt, an ICT Innovation Technical Program Officer with the Grameen Foundation and the leader of the recently-completed Quick Win Project.

	Farmers in the village of Adi Ha in Tigray, Ethiopia have been offered insurance against the weather in order to reduce their risk from crop failures. Two hundred households are currently involved in the project, which is managed by Oxfam America. Each farmer contributes the equivalent of US$5 a year, and many use the money they receive as part of Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Program, a cash-for-work programme, to pay for their crop insurance. &quot;When farmers are allowed to pay in labour, they can afford a lot more insurance,&quot; said Marjorie Victor, senior policy adviser for Oxfam America. In Adi Ha, the teff crop fails roughly once every five years. Under the insurance scheme, each farmer will get up to US$25 if a pre-determined amount of rain needed to grow teff does not fall by a certain date. This money can then help to buy new seeds, preventing farmers going into dept and falling deeper into poverty. (Source: New Agriculturalist, November 2009)</p>

	From seed to market, the good agricultural practices (GAP) <a href="http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/default.htm" target="_blank">website</a> is designed to provide extension officers and agricultural development workers with practical solutions to help irrigated rice farmers boost yields, and improve grain quality and production efficiency. Developed by IRRI, key targets of the site include increasing rice yields, alleviating poverty and creating healthy rice-growing ecosystems by helping farmers to reduce pesticides, fertilisers and water use. In order to meet global demand and keep rice affordable for the poor, IRRI predicts that an additional 8-10 million tons of rice are needed every year for the next 20 years. Adopting the efficient and effective farming practices promoted on the GAP site will go a long way to help lift farmers and their communities out of poverty and hardship, and ensure they have enough rice to eat. The website brings together decades of research on the best management practices for irrigated rice, including information on land preparation, water management, crop health, storage and marketing.

					<p>A team of international scientists has successfully decoded the DNA of the potato blight pathogen. Spread by spores, <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>, or potato blight, is a form of water mould that can ruin crops in just a few days, and causes losses of about US$6 billion each year. The research, published in the journal Nature, discovered that the genome of the organism is between two and four times the size of closely related species and contains areas of repeated DNA sequences which enable fast mutation. These stretches of code are the key to plant infection, changing so rapidly that the host can't fight back. This explains how the pathogen is able to attack new varieties of potato that have been genetically bred to resist the infection. Scientists hope that with a better understanding of the genome it will now be easier to breed new blight resistant potato varieties and develop more effective treatments.

					<p>The Nile Basin Reforestation Project in Uganda is the first in Africa that will receive money from the WB's BioCarbon Fund for reducing carbon emissions. &quot;Forestry and agriculture in Africa are areas where we see great potential for carbon projects and a win-win opportunity for the climate change agenda,&quot; explains Inger Anderson, WB sustainable development director for Africa. &quot;Through climate-smart land management and forest conservation, Africa can play a vital role in carbon sequestration and climate regulation.&quot; Implemented by Uganda's National Forestry Authority and local community organisations, the project will establish a plantation of pine and native species in degraded grassland areas within the Rwoho Central Forest Reserve. In addition to providing a source of income by sequestering carbon, the expansion of sustainably managed forestry resources is expected to generate about 700 jobs for local people and help Uganda meet its growing demand for wood.

British scientists and engineers have been involved in the mission from the start. Global measurements of salinity and soil moisture will improve our understanding of how water is transported around the earth, and how it circulates around the oceans, and lead to more accurate weather forecasts and climate simulations.

					<p>United Nations Member States today reached an agreement that sets out the path to financing sustainable forest management, ending nearly two decades of debate on an issue that is becoming more and more critical because of the impact of climate change. The UN Forum on Forests, representing the world’s countries, agreed at a meeting at UN Headquarters in New York to establish two initiatives that it says will particularly help poor countries in need of assistance. An intergovernmental process is being set up to conduct in-depth analysis of all forms of forest financing over the next four years and a separate process will help countries mobilize funding so they can protect their forests. Jan McAlpine, Director of the Secretariat of the UN Forum on Forests, said the new initiatives – the result of negotiations that date back to the landmark Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 – will lead to innovative solutions because they will bring together the broadest possible cross-section, including governments, donors and the private sector.

					<p>The debate around GM crops in South Africa has flared up once again after the rejection of a permit application for the general release of the <i>SpuntaG2</i>, a potato that is resistant to the <i>Potato Tuber Moth</i> (PTM). While the developers argue that this potato is a blessing to small-scale farmers, who suffer the most from the pest, other organizations reject these claims. To boost both commercial and small-scale agricultural production, the South African government over time has allowed for the introduction of various genetically modified crops, such as maize and soy. The <i>SpuntaG2</i> contains an introduced protein that kills caterpillars of the PTM. It is estimated that this insect contributes to losses of up to U.S.D 5.2 million a year to the country's potato industry. Although a permit application for the general release of this modified vegetable has recently been rejected, the developers remain determined to introduce their potato. It is the small-scale farmers, and not the big commercial potato growers, who suffer from the PTM. Most of them cannot afford to spray chemicals in order to protect their crops The <i>SpuntaG2</i> seeds will therefore be no more expensive then seeds of conventional potatoes. There has been much interest from small-scale farmers, both in South Africa and abroad. (Source: AllAfrica, 30 October 2009)</p>

					<p>Developed countries need urgently to speed up the introduction of environmentally sound technologies to benefit the developing world, an international meeting on climate change and technology transfer has concluded. The two-day meeting, organised by the UN Department for Economic and Social Affairs and India's Ministry of Environment and Forests, ended in New Delhi on the 23rd of October with a statement on global cooperation on climate technology. Emerging nations need climate change technologies to be deployed on a large scale — and the time that elapses between their development and their being used in developing countries should be minimised, the meeting said. The statement is expected to be discussed at the UNFCCC summit in Copenhagen in December. (Source: Scidev.net, 28 October 2009)</p>

					<p>To raise awareness of the disastrous effects of climate change in the Caribbean, the Ministry of Planning, Housing and the Environment of Trinidad and Tobago has launched a public forum initiative to engage the public in environmental dialogue on how the Government and the population can work to reduce the nation’s levels of green house gases. The government and ministry’s initiative of public forums is part of their move to promote social education, awareness and understanding of how climate change has affected the Caribbean and what is being done locally to prevent further atmospheric deterioration. The forum was attended by students, ministry employees, environmental groups and non-governmental organisations, all of who were invited to ask questions about and make suggestions on the Government’s actions to combat climate change. The focus of the forum is to propel climate change discussions and knowledge and to create a social consciousness of the population’s role in fighting climate change. The Trinidad and Tobago government has produced an environmental policy that will be presented at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting to be held in Port of Spain in November 2009.

					<p>The promise of biofuels like ethanol is that they will someday help the world grow its way out of its addiction to oil. The reasoning is that if we use greener biofuels in place of gasoline, it will significantly enhance our effort to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. But the question is, are biofuels really green? A pair of new studies in the October 22 issue of Science damningly demonstrate that the answer is no, at least not the way we currently create and use them. In the first study, a team of researchers led by Jerry Melillo of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Massachusets (USA) projected the effects of a major biofuel expansion over the coming century and found that it could end up increasing global greenhouse-gas emissions instead of reducing them. In the second paper, another team of researchers of Princeton University uncovered a potentially damaging flaw in the way carbon emissions from bioenergy are calculated under the Kyoto Protocol and in the carbon cap-and-trade bill currently being debated in the US Congress. Melillo's paper points out that if biofuels scale up rapidly, they could end up displacing cropland and pasture, which would impact global food supplies and increase land-based carbon emissions. Melillo found that if biofuels were linked to a global policy to stabilize carbon concentrations in the atmosphere at 550 parts per million — a modest goal — we would need more land for biofuel production by the end of the 21st century than is currently used for all food crops. Worse, all the fertilizer needed to grow those bioenergy crops would increase emissions of nitrous oxide, an extremely potent greenhouse gas, and water supplies would also be stressed. Melillo calls for a complete analysis of the unintended consequences of biofuels. (Source: African Agriculture, 23 October 2009)</p>

					<p>The AU will have to prioritise its projects next year as funds for supporting continent-specific science programmes are running low. Jean-Pierre Ezin, AU commissioner for science, technology and human resources, told delegates at the 11th TWAS congress in Durban, South Africa, between the 20th to 23rd of October, that the global financial crisis has led to a reduction in some funding sources. “The future is worrying for all,” he said, adding that “the only financial resource consists of 53 member countries, philanthropists, and rich country aid agencies”. A decline in direct investment and possible cuts in overseas aid pose a serious challenge for African governments. Ezin said the future lies in focusing on Africa–Africa cooperation and said that the Pan-African University (see <a href="http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/Pan-African-University-could-launch-early-next-year" target="_blank">Pan-African University could launch early next year</a>) will be one of the surviving projects.</p>

					<p>Cuban farmers started sowing a new variety of pineapple that triples the yield of previous ones and has higher concentrations of sugar and vitamin C, according to experts. Known as <i>MD-2</i>, the species is capable of producing from 80 to 120 tons per hectare, three times more than the traditional <i>Red Spanish</i>, the most common variety in the country. This kind of fruit is a hybrid obtained in labs in Hawaii from the <i>Smooth Cayenne</i> variety, which is characterized by its big size, cylindrical shape and very few thorns. The head of the Business Unit for Fruit Trees in Ciego de Avila province told the press that the first of 67 hectares are already sown. (Source: Caribbean Net News, 21 October 2009)</p>
