						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Under a new initiative international donors are backing Africa-based policy research to improve local decision-making on complex global issues like food security and climate change. Led by Canada’s International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and funded by IDRC, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the Hewlett Foundation, the Think Tank Initiative will provide core funding for 24 African think tanks over 10 years. US$30 million has been made available for the initial five years. “African think tanks are essential to development and to disaster preparedness and to climate adaptation,” said Cheikh Ba, senior researcher at the Senegal-based agricultural institute IPAR, a grant recipient. “We can look ahead and anticipate the most urgent crises that our country will face and gather experts and community members and government to find solutions.” (Source: IRIN, 2 July 2009)</p>

					<p>Scientists at an India-based institute are developing new varieties of pigeon pea, a high-protein dietary staple. In the eastern Kenyan district of Makueni, a research team is testing more than 40 varieties of pigeon pea, cross-bred to thrive in different altitudes, temperatures, rainfall, and other conditions, that can also be grown in Tanzania, Malawi, and Mozambique. The new varieties of pigeon peas are being introduced to Kenya by the <a href="http://www.icrisat.org/" target="_self">International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, ICRISAT</a>. Farmers have cultivated pigeon pea in this East African nation for centuries. But traditional varieties tend to take about 10 months to mature. Some of the new varieties being developed and tested in Kenya mature within five months of being planted, enabling farmers to have two or more harvests a year. Maize, considered to be the key crop in Kenya, does not flourish in times of drought. But pigeon pea grows well in dry times, says scientist Said Silim, director of ICRISAT's Eastern and Southern Africa program. (Source: VAO, 29 June 2009)</p>

					<p>
The Nigerian Federal government, in collaboration with donor agencies like the United States Agency for International Development and Rockefeller foundation, is providing 40 million for the first phase of research into pest-resistance cowpea crops to last between 8 and 12 years. The research has already begun with a confined field trial of insect resistant transgenic cowpea at the Institute for Agricultural Research (IAR), Zaria in line with guidelines by the national biosafety committee.Principal investigator of the research, Dr.Mohammed Ishiyaka Faguji said farmers in Nigeria record about 70-90% reduction in cowpea production annually due to pest infestation. The cowpea project will culminate in development of farmer-preferred, adapted high yielding transgenic cowpea varieties which will assist in the growth of the private sector. The second phase of the research will be the testing of the transgenic cowpea on target pest in collaborating African countries of Ghana and Burkina Faso. (Source: ASNS, 28 June 2009)</p>

					<p>Malawi's newly re-elected president has promised increased investment in science as part of a plan to transform the country into a net exporter of goods and services. Bingu wa Mutharika, said that he would prioritise science and technology along with other key areas including agriculture and food security; irrigation and water development; and environmental degradation. Increased funding for science is widely expected in the 2009–10 budget, to be announced in the next fortnight. The increase will partly fund a new Commission of Science and Technology, which is expected to be established next month. He called for a return of Malawi's disbanded research fund, which rewarded researchers who made good research proposals. Mutharika also emphasised continuing investment in tertiary education.

					<p>A CARICOM working group on traditional knowledge (TK), traditional cultural expressions (TCEs) and genetic resources went on a fact-finding mission in Jamaica. The group is made up of representatives from the Jamaica Intellectual Property Office (JIPO) and several of their counterparts from across the region. The aim of the group is to determine the best method of protecting the traditional knowledge that is specific and particular to Jamaica, and other Caribbean countries, which have been in use for several generations. Executive Director of JIPO, Carol Simpson, said that there are no international norms that protect these rights, hence the setting up of several working groups by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) to examine the issue. The working group is carrying out similar missions across the Caribbean, and it is expected that the results from all the missions will be included in a report, with recommendations for protection, that will be submitted to the Governments of the region. The Governments will consider the report, in the hope of agreeing on measures to be put in place to prevent the misappropriation or misuse of the knowledge, information and genetic resources of Caribbean countries.

A pilot project in India and Nigeria is learning some interesting lessons from five very different sites about building capacity for change around the issue of fodder scarcity. Fodder scarcity is an age-old problem and one which most livestock keepers face in developing countries, particularly during the dry season. For decades, researchers have developed a range of technologies to address the problem, including new varieties, fodder banks and alternative cropping patterns. However, despite the wealth of knowledge and technologies developed, little progress has been made in resolving the issue. The approach taken by the Fodder Innovation Project is to look beyond the issue of fodder, and to focus on the broader context of the livestock system in these five pilot areas. For example in Ibadan, Nigeria, a goat marketing system has been established to provide incentives for farmers to invest in fodder. &quot;By taking this wider focus,&quot; says Andy Hall, researcher at the UN University (UNU-MERIT), &quot;the issue of fodder scarcity is not just about technologies but about the collective capacity of a network of individuals and organisations to use different types of information to bring about change.&quot; (Source: New Agriculturist, May 2009)Related Links: Fodder Innovation Project and livestock dossier</p>

<a href="http://questionbox.org/" target="_self">Question Box</a> is a service being piloted in Uganda and India that allows anyone to call and ask questions to operators that speak their local language. Currently there are approximately three billion people on the planet who don’t have access to the internet or other forms of information technology. Even the most common knowledge you’d find at your local public library eludes them for most of their lives. Literacy both in written languages and especially in computing technology is a luxury for most of the people on the planet. QuestionBox.org applies technology in ways that ensures information is available to all the world’s people. Question Box works by sending people called Community Knowledge Workers (CKW) into the field to aggregate questions from rural communities. The CKW then dials a call center with operators on standby waiting to look up the answers. As the operators enter a search (complete with the demographic info of the question asker) the application is populated with those queries, as they occur in real-time. The application is called World Wants to Know or <a href="http://worldwantstoknow.com" target="_self">WW2K</a>. It’s an exercise in data visualization and offers insight as to the types of information these populations are interested in.</p>

					<p>The CGIAR Gender &amp; Diversity Program is offering a women’s leadership course in 2009. The courses focus on building skills for working in teams, managing conflict, creating alliances and leveraging diversity for good research and development results. They incorporate a 360 evaluation of each participant’s current management and leadership skills, provide insight into broader gender issues she might encounter in the workplace and provide tools for dealing with them. They are conducted by world-class facilitators from Training Resources Group (TRG). From 6 – 12 September 2009 the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) is hosting a women’s leadership course in Los Banos, Philippines. The costs are approximately $ 4,000 for tuition and all course materials. (Travel, accommodation and meals paid separately.) More information about our Women’s Leadership Series is available at the <a href="http://www.genderdiversity.cgiar.org/resource/calendar_events.asp" target="_blank">gender diversity website</a>.</p>

					<p>
The stresses of climate-induced crop failures could be avoided if more small farmers in Africa also raised livestock, say researchers. Climate change will result in a 10-20% drop in yield for crops such as beans, maize and millet in Africa's drylands by 2050, researchers from the Kenya-based International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) and the United Kingdom's Waen Associates found. But many farmers in some of the affected areas could keep livestock to increase their incomes and reduce their vulnerability, the researchers say. The researchers warn that the change to livestock farming must be done sustainably, for example by limiting the number of livestock in an area during dry conditions so the pasture can recover quickly when rains come. Mario Herrero, ILRI's systems analyst, acknowledges that an increase in livestock would increase greenhouse gas emissions but says the impact from the alternative - of herders migrating and cutting down forest to grow crops - could be worse.

					<p>Drylands make up 40 percent of the Earth’s land surface that suffers desertification as a result of unsustainable use of land and water in too many places. These drylands are dynamic ecosystems that feed agricultural growth and are often home to extremely specialized communities of animals and plants. However, they are also increasingly vulnerable to the threat of land degradation. According to the <a href="http://www.unep.org/themes/land/desertificationday.asp" target="_blank">UNEP-led study</a>, best-bet technologies that combine modern science with traditional and indigenous knowledge such as those introduced in the <a href="http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=589&amp;ArticleID=6219&amp;l=en" target="_blank">nine DMP pilot countries in Africa</a>, are a global example of how to combat the trend of desertification with viable solutions. The project introduced new technologies into the area for improving soil moisture, bush management and constructing terraces which are now contributing to a successful revegetation of denuded ranges.
