						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	The recent 'Crop Intensification Program' represents a great opportunity for Rwanda to guarantee food security and strengthen the country's agricultural productivity. However overwhelming evidence is arising that a sustained growth path will be preserved over time only if the production process incorporates sustainability issues. Through qualitative interviews, a quantitative analysis and findings from the literature <a href="http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5712&amp;title=crop-intensification-program-rwanda-sustainability-analysis" target="_blank">this report</a> assesses the sustainability of the current Rwanda 'Crop Intensification Program' formulation and analyzes the interventions that are needed to reconcile immediate food security needs and long run environment proof methods of crops production.

	Dr Nicole Robinson, Research Fellow at the School of Agriculture and Food Science, University of Queensland (Australia), shows in her study on nitrogen assimilation by the sugarcane plant, that, given the choice of different forms of nitrogen, sugarcane strongly prefers ammonium over nitrate and that nitrate fertiliser is an inefficient source of nitrogen for commercial sugarcane crops. The <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/news/index.html?article=23103" target="_blank">study results</a> indicate that grower management practices should aim to reduce nitrate content in soils in favour of ammonium and organic forms of nitrogen. Dr Robinson said further work was required to breed new sugarcane varieties that have an enhanced ability to use nitrate. She said erianthus, a closely related giant grass, currently used in the breeding programme, showed promising results and would provide an avenue for further investigation.

	This <a href="http://www.unido.org/fileadmin/user_media/Services/Agro-Industries/Agribusiness_for_Africas_Prosperity_e-book_NEW.pdf" target="_blank">2011 study</a> by the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) titled ‘Agribusiness for Africa’s Prosperity’ focuses on the opportunities for diversified growth in Africa, and assesses the existing and potential sources of demand growth for agribusiness development on the continent. It includes case studies of countries in their development of agribusiness and agro-industries, identifies innovative financing methods and describes the countries’ internal responses to various challenges. An agenda for action and a framework to guide the efforts of stakeholders, with a key focus on visions, policies, strategies and institutions for Africa’s agribusiness development, is also outlined. A key part of the study is the identification and analysis of the seven development pillars for agribusiness development, which are the actions needed to transform subsistence agriculture into productive agribusiness, as follows: enhancing agricultural productivity; upgrading value chains; exploiting local, regional and international demand; strengthening technological effort and innovation capabilities; promoting effective and innovative financing; stimulating private participation; and improving infrastructure and energy access.

	NOAA-funded researchers hope a new climate information system they developed will help West African farmers help themselves. <a href="http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2011/20110512_rainwatch.html" target="_blank">Rainwatch</a> is a prototype geographic information system (GIS) that monitors monsoon rainfall and tracks season rainfall attributes. This information is crucial because sub-Saharan Africa depends more strongly and directly on rainfall than any other region on Earth, yet the area has the fewest rainfall monitoring stations and significant delays that occur between data collection and its availability for users. Rainwatch automates and streamlines key aspects of rainfall data management, processing and visualization. A major appeal is its simplicity – all interactive interfaces, symbols and names used are unpretentious and self explanatory. In addition, the system can be used by Africans without any outside assistance such as satellite information. In a successful 2009 demonstration involving seven rain gauge stations in Niger, Rainwatch was shown to directly address the area's need for better rainfall data acquisition, management, representation and rapid dissemination. The programme continued in 2010, when it dramatically showed the return of abundant rainfall. It is expected to expand beyond Niger. Because Rainwatch is simple to operate and more streamlined in design and scope than existing systems, the researchers hope the programme will be adopted and used more widely throughout West Africa where other more complicated rainfall data dissemination systems have had limited success.

	The purpose of this guideline (published by the Inter-American Development Bank) is to provide suggestions on designing impact evaluations for agricultural projects, particularly projects that directly target farmers, and seek to improve agricultural production, productivity and profitability. Specific issues in evaluating agricultural projects are addressed, including the need to use production-based indicators and to carefully consider indirect or spillover effects that are common in agricultural projects. The guideline considers the challenges of conducting impact evaluations of agricultural projects as well as the methods for assessing impact. Issues of collecting agricultural data for an impact evaluation and how to put together the overall design strategy in an evaluation plan are also covered. The guideline concludes with three case studies of impact evaluations designed for a technology adoption project in the Dominican Republic, a forestry/technology project in Nicaragua, and a crop insurance project in Peru.

	Proof that innovation pays off. In 2007, the India branch of the Worldwide fund for nature (WWF-India) launched the <a href="http://www.wwfindia.org/news_facts/?1940" target="_blank">project entitled</a> 'Reducing the Impact of Water-intensive and Polluting Crops: Securing sustainable sources of freshwater to support the livelihoods of poor communities in the Godavari Basin' in India (<a href="http://www.wwfindia.org/news_facts/?1940" target="_blank">http://www.wwfindia.org/news_facts/?1940</a>). Inter Press Services <a href="http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=55570" target="_blank">now reports</a> that farmers who have adopted the water efficient measures witnessed water savings to up to 30% of normal water usage. The project is centred on promoting better management practices (BMP), agricultural practices that optimise the three pillars of sustainability – social responsibility, environmental integrity and economic viability. These practices include improvement of planting techniques such as time and method of planting, selection of a suitable variety and appropriate soil, optimum spacing and seed treatment; fertiliser application, type of irrigation and soil drainage and weed control techniques. Sustainable practices are much needed for sugarcane which, according to WWF-India figures, occupies just four per cent of the land in Maharashtra state but consumes nearly two-thirds of the state irrigation supply.

	As interest in bioenergy production continues to grow, FAO is promoting the use of a new methodology designed to help policymakers weigh the pros and cons of investing in the sector. FAO's 'Bioenergy and Food Security (BEFS) Analytical Framework' was created to help governments evaluate the potential of bioenergy as well as assess its possible food security impacts. The framework was recently finalized following a three year development and field test phase in which it was applied in Peru, Tanzania and Thailand. It consists of a series of step-by-step evaluations that seek to answer critical questions regarding the feasibility of bioenergy development and the impacts on food availability and household food security. Social and environmental dimensions are also considered. The UN agency is following up on the framework via its Bioenergy and Food Security Criteria and Indicators (<a href="http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/74708/icode/" target="_blank">BEFSCI</a>) project, which aims to develop a risk prevention and management tool as well as an impact assessment and policy response tool, based on good practices.

	The African Union Ministerial Conference in charge of Science and Technology (AMCOST) has repeatedly called for better understanding of, and improvement in, the state of ST&amp;I (science, technology and innovation) on the continent. These recurrent calls have been embodied in the outcomes of AMCOST decisions over the last decade. The African Science, Technology and Innovation Indicators (ASTII) initiative is a response to AMCOST calls to address the lack of evidence-based policy processes. The African Innovation Outlook is an outcome of the implementation of the ASTII initiative. It is published as the first in a series, intended to inform the people of Africa and other interested parties about ST&amp;I activities in African countries. The report has six chapters, dealing with economic and human development challenges for ST&amp;I; research and development (R&amp;D) activities; innovation; bibliometric analysis of scientific output; and recommendations to address the challenges identified in it. The report can be found <a href="http://www.nepad.org/humancapitaldevelopment/knowledge/doc/2226/african-innovation-outlook-2010-executive-summary" target="_blank">here</a>. (AU-NEPAD, 23/5/2011)</p>

	The EC's EuropeAid Cooperation Office announced (on 11/5/2011) the signature of a €14.75M contract for support to a sub-Saharan African intra-regional research networking infrastructure which is already interconnected to the pan-European research network, GÉANT. The contract represents a significant injection of capital to develop research networking infrastructure across sub-Saharan Africa and with Europe. The AfricaConnect project will establish a high-capacity Internet network for research and education in Southern and Eastern Africa to provide the region with a gateway to global research collaboration, the objective of which is to overcome the current limitations of international research collaboration within sub-Saharan Africa and towards Europe, and to foster research and education collaboration and advancement within and between these regions. The project will be strongly collaborative, so whilst DANTE, the international research network operator that got the contract, will coordinate AfricaConnect, they will be partnered by DANTE's regional counterpart organisations in Africa – UbuntuNet Alliance covering Eastern and Southern Africa, and WACREN covering Western and Central Africa – as well as the Association of African Universities; existing National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) in Africa (DRC, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia); and several European NRENs (Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK). In April 2010, Knowledge for development mentioned the publication of the final report on the Feasibility Study on the AfricaConnect Initiative (<a href="http://knowledge.cta.int/en/content/view/full/11449" target="_blank">FEAST project</a>).</p>

	Efforts to limit the devastation usually following the arrival of swarms of locusts in the West African Sahel will be strengthened by coordination across the region thanks to the 'Africa Project to Combat Locust Invasions'. The project is known by its French acronym, PALUCP (for 'Projet Africain de Lutte d'Urgence contre le Criquet Pèlerin'), and includes Mali, Burkina Faso, Gambia, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Chad. This regional project depends on the sharing of information and experiences in the fight against the locust threat; identifying strategies for managing the fight and establishing the basis for better collaboration between the various role-players and small-holder farmers. Eradication strategies differ in each country and techniques to identify and decimate locusts' population cradles, sharing of knowledge and cross border strategies are therefore crucial for the action's success. 'It's about predicting, anticipating and knowing where they [the locusts] are to prevent them from multiplying exponentially and then decimating them where they reproduce,' said the agricultural minister from Senegal at the PALUCP workshop that took place in Dakar in March 2011. The 'Centre National de Lutte Contre le Criquet Pèlerin' (CNLCP, Mali, <a href="http://www.cnlcp.net/palucp.php" target="_blank">www.cnlcp.net/palucp.php</a>) coordinates the project.

	Many governments are tempted to impose fertilizer subsidies to reduce fertilizer prices, but in an environment riddled with inefficiencies that contribute to the high costs of using fertilizers, the introduction of subsidies only adds more fiscal burden. This new publication from the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC) is a study that identifies a key set of policy options for improving the efficiency of regional markets and lowering the transaction costs and fiscal burdens of fertilizer use in West Africa. The authors undertook four country case studies (Ghana, Mali, Nigeria, and Senegal) to review the key constraints and bottlenecks along the fertilizer supply chain. This paper is based on the country case study results, complemented by a literature review and analysis of secondary data sources.

	In Samoa, organic premium oil produced from the nut of the fetau plant (also known as <i>tamanu oil</i>) will be exported to Germany in May or June 2011. The fetau plant known in Samoa is scientifically called the <i>Calophyllum inophyllum</i>. It is popular in the Pacific for its decorative leaves, fragrance and spreading crown.The seeds produce thick dark green oil with active ingredients believed to regenerate tissue and is sought after by cosmetics manufacturers as an ingredient in skin creams. It is known to be highly skin absorbent and to have a light walnut fragrance. In Samoa, two charity organizations donated two German-built compact high tech oil presses to the Women in Business Development Inc., a small business that will from now on produce high quality cold-pressed and parasite free oil from Samoan fetau nuts.

Knowledge sharing is the best way to help drive increased agricultural productivity in Africa, according to the African Forum for Agricultural Advisory Services (AFASS). The organisation outlined the recommendation in its four-year strategic plan that was developed at its most recent summit in Accra, Ghana. The four year plan advocates for a wider dissemination of research outputs, increasing the uptake of new and improved technologies (including biotechnology), and committing to additional research to help improve knowledge sharing in Africa. The plan’s ultimate goal is to bring all national agricultural advisors together under a single information-sharing platform.(ICTSD, April 2011)</p>

The Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels has launched a set of comprehensive sustainability criteria - the ‘RSB Certification System’, for biofuel producers. Biofuels producers that adhere to these criteria are able to show buyers and regulators that their product has been obtained without harming the environment or violating human rights. The criteria apply along the full value chain, allowing traceability from production through feedstock to the point of consumption. The Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels is a multi-stakeholder forum including 120 environmental organisations, biofuels producers, governments and other interested parties. This group has worked out a comprehensive set of environmental and social criteria that are in line with EU sustainability criteria.(ICTSD, April 2011)</p>

An Africa-wide forum for parliamentarians, the African Inter-Parliamentary Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation (AIPF-ST&amp;I), which aims to give science, technology and innovation (ST&amp;I) a more central role in the policy-making process was launched 2 May 2011, on the sidelines of the Second Session of the Committee on Development Information, Science and Technology (CODIST-II), held in Ethiopia. Aida Opoku-Mensah, director of the ICT and science &amp; technology division at UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), said: ‘The move by parliamentarians to take interest in ST&amp;I will help push its agenda within their governments so it gets due attention.’ She added that conversations between parliamentarians and scientists should lead to improved structures for research and development. The forum was launched as a result of collaboration between UNECA, the African Union, UNESCO, the Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (ISESCO) and other partners. This is the first Africa-wide forum for parliamentarians with a central agenda of promoting ST&amp;I.(Scidev via The Courier and University World News, 5/5/2011)</p>

	The techniques of <b>Natural Sequence Farming</b> (NSF) were developed during hands-on management of degraded farmland in the Upper Hunter Valley region of Australia. Early settlement of the continent by people with European cultural assumptions disrupted established interactions of water, soil, and plants resulting in lost fertility. Moreover, agricultural practices such as clearing, burning, ploughing, draining, and irrigation, have implications for global warming. Soils hold twice as much carbon as the atmosphere, and three times as much as vegetation. But carbon in exposed soil oxidises, releasing CO2 into the atmosphere. NSF is designed to restore ecosystem functions by re-coupling the carbon and water cycles. This is a valid technique for dryland regions around the world.</p>
