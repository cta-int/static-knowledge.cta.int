						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

A pilot project to see if cash crops can be grown in the salty ground of India's coastal areas has been launched. Dr Selvam - who works for the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation, which runs the project - said the aim was to see whether sea water could be considered a social resource, and if so in what way it could be used to increase food production. The project area will house dozens of species of halophytes - or salt-loving plants - that can be used for producing cash crops.
Halophytes can be used to produce edible oils, medicines, vegetables, and cattle and fish feed. Saline water plants can also be used to produce fine chemicals, biofuels and even building materials. Field studies conducted in the US and East Africa have suggested that halophytes such as sea asparagus can be grown as commercial crops. Backers of the scheme say it could transform agricultural production in coastal areas which are becoming increasingly saline not only in India but in other parts of the world as well.(Source: BBC, 11 January 2011)</p>

A new report by (IFPRI) challenges previous analyses of the food price crisis of 2007-2008. Using recently available data, ‘Reflections on the Global Food Crisis’ identifies the key causes of the price surge, its consequences for the world’s poor people, and the implications for future policies. The authors conclude that the crisis was not primarily fostered by increased demand for meat products in rising economies such as China and India, or by declines in agricultural yields or food stocks, or by futures market speculation. Instead, they attribute the rising food prices to a combination of rising energy prices; growing demand for bio-fuels; the U.S. dollar depreciation; and various trade shocks related to export restrictions, panic purchases, and unfavourable weather. As part of their analysis, the authors also provide the first comprehensive review of both the macroeconomic and microeconomic consequences of the crisis, as well as a detailed comparison of the current crisis with the food price crisis of 1974.(Source: IFPRI, 18 Nov. 2010).</p>

Scientists at the Kellogg Biological Station at the US-based Michigan State University, and colleagues at universities in the UK, Canada and Malawi, have found that crop diversification using pigeon-pea - shrubby legumes grown in tropical regions - mixed with soybean and peanuts could be key to sustaining an agricultural green revolution in Africa. They found that planting a unique acacia known as a 'fertiliser tree' among the crops automatically fertilised the fields. This makes the integration of fertiliser trees into crop and livestock-holding farms an affordable and accessible solution for improving food production. In recent times, biological and social-economic drivers in Africa were promoting sole-cropping of cereals as a source of calorie-rich food, however this ‘agro-simplification’ has had severe consequences, including reduced capacity for light capture, nutrient cycling and instability of production. The researchers examined the diversified rotation approach instead of simply planting a continuous crop, as a way to solve this problem, and they tested crop diversification in Malawi. They found that diversifying crops would boost production of nutrient-enriched grain by 12%-23%. Rotating corn with a shrubby legume-enhanced fertiliser increased efficiency, profitability and stability of the grain produced. Crop diversification, according to the researchers, could help farmers reduce their dependence on expensive imported fertilizers. Findings of the study were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in November.(Source : University World News, 5 December 2010)</p>

In an effort to expand its aquaculture sector, the Kenyan government has invested money in an innovative pilot project in the Likuyani District, Western province, Kenya. Around 50 fish ponds have been dug in the Lugari constituency, and with the help of the NGO 'Voices of Africa', the ponds are monitored by GPRS (‘General packet radio service’ - a packet oriented mobile data service) and satellite images. The aim is to use the 24-hour monitoring system to identify threats to the fish stocks and capture early any shortfalls in pond management: the technology enables farmers to receive accurate information and assess the health of their ponds. Small-scale fish farmers are already reaping the benefits of the monitoring system (they tackle issues that can become a problem if left unattended) and efforts are made to promote the adoption of the technology in neighbouring districts.(Source: AllAfrica, 23 November 2010)</p>

Fisheries is one of the Pacific Island region’s most vital economic resources, and a new study shows that overfishing, overcrowding and climate change are threatening it with collapse by 2035. The report, published by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), a regional intergovernmental organisation based in Fiji, said the €1.5 billion a year industry was poorly managed, with a lack of coordination between the 22 island nations in the region. The study highlighted the coral reefs as particularly vulnerable to climate change, in turn affecting adversely the fish stocks feeding there, and predicted that growing populations in island nations would fuel demand for fish, increasing the risk of unsustainable practices. Future priorities for this sector include the reform and the building of fisheries agencies for better services and maximising long-term national benefits from offshore resources.(Source : The Fisheries Secretariat, 28/10/2010)</p>

Research published in November 2010 by the academic journal ‘Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences’ (PNAS) provides new evidence that ecological restoration can provide a cost effective response to environmental degradation. The research focused on the dryland forests of Latin America, and examined the cost effectiveness of ecological restoration techniques such as tree planting and forest regeneration. This was achieved using a novel research approach, which involved mapping the value of different benefits provided by these forests. The research was conducted by a team of ecologists from the UK, Mexico, Chile and Argentina, headed by Professor Adrian Newton of Bournemouth University, UK. The problem of environmental degradation is most intense in arid and semi-arid areas, which comprise half the surface area of the world’s developing countries and very little evidence is available regarding whether efforts towards ecological restoration of dryland forest ecosystems are cost effective. The team of academics analysed six different study areas across Latin America. Research focused on valuing the benefits provided by forests to people, including carbon sequestration, timber, non-timber products, and tourism. The costs of forest restoration were also estimated, including loss of livestock production, cost of fencing, fire suppression and tree establishment. Three different restoration approaches were examined, which were compared using a simulation model of forest landscapes. The results showed that ecological restoration of dry forests is most likely to be cost effective if ‘passive’ approaches are adopted, which support the natural process of forest recovery. ‘Active’ restoration approaches, involving tree planting, are less likely to be cost effective, because of the high costs associated with new tree establishment. Such findings should encourage decision-makers to support restoration efforts.(AlphaGalileo, 22 Novembre 2010)</p>

A new research study from New Mexico State University (USA) presents a process for efficient extraction of the red pigments in Capsicum (chile pepper) using ‘green chemistry’. In addition to their known nutritional value, the red pigments are important as sources of non-toxic red dyes; the red pigments are added to many processed foods and cosmetics to enhance their appearance. Certain varieties of <i>Capsicum annuum</i> can be &quot;extracted' to isolate red-colored xanthophylls, an important economical source of red pigments that can replace carcinogenic synthetic red dyes. Current extraction processes are limiting; red pigment can only be recovered from American paprika varieties or other mild cultivars. According to a team of researchers from the Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences at New Mexico State University, if extraction of the red pigments could be achieved separate from the capsaicinoids, then a wider range of red-fruited cultivars could be used, including those with important values as fresh green crops. The &quot;green&quot; extraction method includes a process that separates the pigments from the capsaicinoids, an important step which the researchers say increases the flexibility of the process to allow a variety of red Capsicum fruit to be used easily for pigment production. The authors noted that this step in the process is critical, as it allows the pigment industry and Capsicum farmers to use virtually any variety of chile regardless of heat level for pigment production.(Source: ScienceDaily, 26 January 2011)</p>

Scientists at the National Agricultural Research Laboratories (NARL, part of the National Agricultural Research Organisation of Uganda - NARO) in Kawanda, Uganda have started researching cereals that can resist a fungus causing aflatoxins. These are toxic substances, produced by fungi that colonise maize, soya, groundnuts, millet and cassava, affecting seeds and causing them to mould. Dr Andrew Kiggundu, head of the National Agriculture Biotechnology Centre (also part of NARO), says, “We are proposing to use genetic engineering technology to develop crop varieties that will be resistant to the fungi in the field since infection starts at that stage. We hope that by reducing the fungi in the field, we will be controlling aflatoxins in the value chain”. He reveals that through a project dubbed “Developing Safe Grains for African Crops”, they have started setting up systems, obtaining and preparing genes using their locally resourced funds. The head of the Post Harvest Research Programme at NARL also believes that the research on aflatoxin could limit the distribution of contaminated seeds and tackle a serious health issue in rural areas, as traders use the ‘grinding’ process to hide contaminated seeds, putting people at risk of feeding on highly contaminated food.(Source: The Daily Monitor (Uganda), 2 February 2011)</p>

The first phase of the Nelson Mandela African Institute for Science and Technology (NM-AIST) in Arusha, Tanzania will be completed mid 2011. The institution's vice chancellor Prof. Burton Mwamila indicated that students’ admission would start in late 2011. He pointed out that the college would only enrol students who will pursue post-graduate degrees (doctorate and masters) in various scientific and engineering disciplines. Students would be enrolled from 18 African countries which have shown interest in the project. Nearly half a dozen other colleges/campuses are being set up in other parts of the continent under the Nelson Mandela Foundation. The Arusha campus is devoted to science and technology.(Source: The Citizen, Tanzania; 27 December 2010)</p>

Last December, the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation – ACP/EU (CTA), the Caribbean Council for Science and Technology (CCST), the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI), the University of the West Indies (UWI), the National Institute of Higher Education Research Science and Technology (NIHERST) and the Trinidad &amp; Tobago Film Company (TTFC) hosted a training workshop on film and video production for successful entrants who had participated in Phase 1 of the Caribbean Science and Agriculture Film and Video Competition for Young Professionals. The training included script writing and the importance of research; camera and lighting techniques; microphone &amp; audio techniques; interviewing tips &amp; techniques; editing/post production techniques; introduction to Adobe Photoshop for video editors and Adobe After Effects and creating 2D Animation in after effects. Entries were received from 39 teams from eight countries; Jamaica, Barbados, St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, St. Lucia, Haiti, Grenada, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago and 60 members received training. Five teams have opted to use animation while the majority of teams prefer to utilize the video or film medium. Themes for the productions include “New technologies and youth in agriculture” which is by far the dominant category, followed by “importance of agricultural innovation” and “climate change”. Other topics included water scarcity, biotechnology, and exploring niche markets. The next phase of the competition will be the production and submission of the final film or video for screening and evaluation. Organizers will provide the young professionals with mentors to ensure the scientific and technical merit of their final submissions. An awards ceremony will be held later this year when the short listed teams will vie for the top awards. The pieces will be aired on stations throughout the region and hopefully will also be used in classroom teaching.(Source: CCST, January 2011)</p>

Swaziland Water and Agricultural Development Enterprise (SWADE), a local state-owned company, is working with several local and international partners to develop a large-scale irrigation scheme for the Lower Usuthu region of Swaziland. The main infrastructure, including three dams to store flood flows diverted from the Lower Usuthu River, is being constructed as part of the Lower Usuthu Smallholder Irrigation Project (LUSIP). The project will initially provide irrigation water to 2600 households, covering 6500 hectares of land. Remote sensing and GIS have been crucial in the planning and management of the project. The data gathered are used primarily to inform farmers on how to make the best use of the newly irrigated land. Data are analysed with GIS to identify areas which can be irrigated, show soil types and plot existing water sources. SWADE uses geographically referenced data of the area to produce maps pinpointing the households that need special attention; those with very low incomes or situated on land with especially poor crop yields. They also use the maps to outline current land-ownership patterns and to plot community facilities, such as schools and clinics. The mapping information helps LUSIP staff to give advice to the traditional land authorities when planning future land use. The data can help them designate grazing and rangeland areas, resettle people onto irrigable land, and develop guidelines for water supply, roads and electricity.(Source: ICT Update, 31 August 2010)</p>

In Brazil, the Climapest project has brought together 134 researchers from 37 institutions to evaluate the potential effects of climate change on crop health. Climapest began in January 2009 and has a four-year mandate to study 85 problems of plant health affecting 16 crops, including major exported crops like coffee, soybeans and fruit (banana, apple and grape), as well as African palm and castor oils. Some of the aspects to be studied are the effects of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, as well as warmer temperatures, and ultraviolet B rays on diseases, pests and invasive species. The changes in climate will not necessarily aggravate the crop diseases in all cases, because warmer temperatures or increased carbon gases could impede the proliferation of certain microorganisms. Funguses, viruses and other agents that are harmful to agriculture are among the organisms that react fastest to changes in the climate, because of their short life-cycles and their ability to reproduce quickly. Predicting the future seasonal and geographical distribution of these enemies to farm productivity is another goal of the research. The project is drawing up maps that indicate the geographic evolution of the enemies of each crop, according to the best and worst climate scenarios laid out for 2020, 2050 and 2080, based on the five global models of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). By late 2012, Climapest hopes to have ready a series of maps and collated data on the plant health risks, in order to guide decision-making strategies in the different sectors.(Source: IPS News, 30 December 2010)</p>

Rice bred to perform well in the toughest conditions where the poorest farmers grow rice is a step away from reaching farmers thanks to a major project led by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). Green Super Rice is actually a mix of more than 250 different potential rice varieties and hybrids variously adapted to difficult growing conditions such as drought and low inputs, including no pesticide and less fertilizer, and with rapid establishment rates to out-compete weeds, thus reducing the need for herbicides. Green Super Rice is already in the hands of national agricultural agencies in key rice-growing countries for testing and development. Green Super Rice is an example of what is needed as part of a ‘Greener Revolution’, which is called for by rice scientists around the world and is one of the driving concepts behind the Global Rice Science Partnership (GRiSP) – a plan to improve international partnerships in rice research, its delivery and impact, that would also ensure that rice is grown in an environmentally sustainable way.(Source: CGIAR News, 14 January 2011)</p>

The publication of <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayIssue?decade=2010&amp;jid=EAG&amp;volumeId=47&amp;issueId=S1&amp;iid=7967357" target="_blank">a special issue of<i> Experimental Agriculture</i></a> presents evidence from Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and India, and captures current understanding of strategies to improve water productivity in drought-prone crop-livestock systems. Crop-livestock systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are mostly rainfall-dependent and based on fragmented marginal lands that are vulnerable to soil erosion, drought and variable weather conditions. The threat of water scarcity in these systems is real, due to expanding demand for food and feed, climate variability and inappropriate land use. Strategies and policies to reduce rural poverty should not only target increasing food production but should also emphasize improving water productivity at farm, landscape, sub-basin and higher levels. In drought-prone rural areas, an increase of 1% in crop water productivity makes available at least an extra 24 litres of water a day per person. Moreover, farming systems with efficient use of water resources are commonly responsive to external and internal drivers of change. (Source: ILRI, 14 January 2011)</p>

Scientists at Rothamsted Research, United Kingdom, in collaboration with the International Center for Agriculture Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), Syria, have developed a method of accounting for spatial trend in single crop field trials. Spatial trend refers to the variations in crop yield and other characteristics observed when repeating this single crop field trial. Usually plant breeders will grow several replicate plots to assess the breed line in different environments and then compare the results to commercial or standard varieties of the crop. When resources or seed are scarce, breeders will grow only a single plot of a test line alongside a number of other standard varieties acting as check plots.
According to the authors of the study, results have shown that adjustment for spatial trend within the trials is possible and gives improved accuracy on the estimates of line performance. A crop developed by Dr Miloudi Nachit at ICARDA was used to illustrate spatial trend in this particular experimental design. The teams used simulations to further demonstrate the dramatic increase in precision in estimating the performance of a line while adjusting for spatial trend. However, these measurements are not without their flaws: one drawback to the use of spatial adjustment is the possible subjectivity and difficulty in the choice of a model. Collaborative efforts are continuing at both facilities and the full paper is available in the November-December 2010 Issue of<i> Agronomy Journal</i>.(Source: <a href="http://http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-01/asoa-sac010611.php" target="_blank">Eurekalert</a>, 23 December 2010)</p>

The US-based World Watch Institute’s annual State of the World report (2011) calls for a move away from industrial agriculture and discusses small-scale initiatives in sub-Saharan Africa that work towards poverty and hunger relief in an environmentally sustainable way. The authors suggest that instead of producing more food to meet the world’s growing population needs, a more effective way to address food security issues and climate change would be to encourage self-sufficiency and waste reduction, in wealthier and poorer nations alike.(Source: The guardian UK via ILRI News, 13 Jan 2011).</p>

The Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) has introduced a new farming technology for breeding multiple disease- free potato tubers in a bid to achieve a widespread take-off in productivity for the country’s potato farmers. “But output could be higher”, says KARI, which reports that currently only one to two per cent of Kenyan farmers use certified potato breeds. The challenge of making better breeds available to farmers is hampered by the low numbers of reproduction laboratories in Kenya. Only the Agricultural Development Corporation in Molo and Kisima Farm in Timau, Kenya breed new potato varieties. Many private breeders shy away from commercial potato tuber reproduction due to the high costs involved. KARI hopes that by importing a high-yield potato breeding technology it can attract more private breeders into the industry. Dubbed aeroponics, the new technology, adopted by KARI from Lima in Peru last year, grows potato tubers in “air” without the use of soil. The tubers are grown in liquid chemical solutions with extra nutrients that increase resistance to disease. The extra nutrients include potassium nitrates, calcium, and phosphate minerals. Using aeroponics guarantees a farmer five times more tubers per plant compared to when tubers are planted in the soil and guarantees sequential harvesting of tubers for six months.(Source: African Agriculture, 30 December 2010)</p>

According to the Kenya Food Security Meeting (KFSM) - the coordinating body that brings together relevant actors in a forum to map out strategies to improve food security - there has been a general rain failure in the country since 2007, which has resulted in the deterioration in food security. It is against this background that researchers have intensified research on crops that can grow in most parts of Kenya and which can be used to alleviate food insecurity. Many Kenyan farmers now accommodate traditional vegetables on their land (that were once dismissed as the &quot;poor man’s crop&quot;) together with the more modern crops. Small-scale farmers say traditional vegetables grow easily and are very nutritious. The change of attitude towards traditional vegetables can be traced back 20 years ago when Professor Mary Abukutsa Onyango, now a lecturer at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Kenya, pioneered extensive research in traditional vegetables such as African eggplant, nightshades and cow peas. Her research aimed to improve the uptake of African traditional vegetables and to help farmers earn a living from selling the crops; it has revealed that the introduction of exotic vegetables such as asparagus and broccoli in Kenya has, as is the case with many African countries, had a negative effect on the consumption and commercialisation of traditional vegetables. Her research has been multifaceted and has involved solutions to the negative attitude towards traditional vegetables. This has necessitated her to provide instructions on how to grow various vegetables, as well as provide recipes on how to prepare them.(Source: IPS News, 20 December 2010)</p>
