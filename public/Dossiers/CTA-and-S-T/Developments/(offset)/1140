						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	The MAREX ('Exploring marine resources for bioactive compounds: from discovery to sustainable production and industrial applications') project has received EUR 6 million under the 'Food, agriculture and fisheries, and biotechnology' (KBBE) Theme of the EU's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) to collect, isolate and classify marine organisms, including sea anemones, tunicates and micro and macroalgae, from the Mediterranean, Baltic and Arabian Seas as well as the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Companies worldwide are working to identify and exploit various natural sources of compounds that could prove effective in drugs and other products. Joining this effort is an EU-funded team of scientists that is hunting for biologically active substances in marine organisms that could be suitable for use as a basis for pharmaceutical goods.

	Talks between member states of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) have produced a draft policy on GM technology, which was sent for national consultation early September 2010. It is a breakthrough to see a group of 19 African nations working to develop policies that should make it clear to all sides in the debate that Africa can make up its own mind. COMESA is a trade bloc, and its proposals aim to develop research and trade in GM crops, stating that decisions regarding GMOs should be based on sound science and evidence. The use of GM crops for food divides opinion, especially when it comes to Africa. Sharp views on the technology in the developed world, honed by more than a decade of arguments in Europe and elsewhere, are too easily projected onto Africa, with the continent portrayed as a passive participant in the global melodrama over GM food.

	Scientists at the Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics scientists have inserted a gene which modified rice to increase the number of salt-transporting proteins in specific cells in the rice root. This resulted in salt being trapped in the root where it is less harmful and avoiding its effect to the vulnerable upper part of the plant. Dr. Darren Plett, lead researcher of the study, says that the new GM technique is an ‘efficient and robust biotechnological approach’ to help rice grow in soils with high salinity. ‘Our results provide a new approach for genetic modification to increase the tolerance of crops to the toxic sodium ion (Na+), which is a major environmental stress. Work is now underway to transfer the technology to wheat and barley.

	This report, produced by Friends of the Earth Europe, says that the amount of land being taken in Africa to meet Europe’s increasing demand for biofuels is underestimated and out of control. The research, which looked at 11 African countries, found at least five million hectares of land – an area the size of Denmark – is being acquired by foreign companies to produce biofuels mainly for the European market. The practice – known as land grabbing – is increasing and is dominated by European companies. However with official public information largely absent, current figures are likely to be only a snapshot and gross underestimates. <a href="http://www.foeeurope.org/agrofuels/FoEE_Africa_up_for_grabs_2010.pdf" target="_blank">View PDF</a> (Source: Zunia, 31 August 2010)</p>

	Farmers and crop scientists worldwide are engaged in an ambitious new effort to add 3,000 yam samples to international genebanks with the aim of saving the diversity of yam, according to the Global Crop Diversity Trust. Benin already has sent 847 yam samples to the IITA, Ibadan, Nigeria. At IITA, the tubers will be grown out in fields, and cuttings taken for conservation in the lab as part of an international collection that already contains about 3,200 yam samples from West Africa. The yam project is part of a broader effort involving major crop species worldwide in which the Trust is helping partners in 68 countries—including 38 in Africa alone—rescue and regenerate more than 80,000 endangered accessions in crop collections and send duplicates to international genebanks and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in the Arctic Circle. For yams, reproduced through vegetative propagation, IITA offers the only long-term form of conservation. Conserving the crop requires extracting tissue in the laboratory and freezing it in liquid nitrogen. However, the technique demands careful research and a staff of dedicated skilled technicians.

	The PNG National Agricultural Research Institute (NARI) has developed a new feeding technology for broiler chicken using locally available feed resources, known as the NARI Broiler Concentrate. This technology is currently going through on-farm trials with many already proving successful in terms of increased profitability from reduced input costs. Comparative broiler production from a recent trial at the Komperi Valley near Kainantu, Eastern Highlands Province, was one of the testimonies of the use of this technology. To combat high feed prices faced by broiler farmers, NARI has taken an approach in using a concentrate diet with local energy sources such as sweet potato and cassava as feed or rations for finishing off broiler chickens to reduce input costs. These NARI concentrates come in two forms; the high energy concentrate which is used with boiled mash cassava and low energy concentrate which is used with boiled mash sweet potatoes. Farmers were also introduced to the sweet potato ensiling technology for the development and storage of pig feeds. (Source: PNG National Agricultural Research Institute, 9 August 2010)</p>

	The Special Meeting of the Council for Trade and Economic Development (COTED) Agriculture held in St George’s, Grenada concluded on 22 october 2010 with the endorsement of the ‘Regional Food and Nutrition Security Policy and Action Plan’, a document meant to be a comprehensive and integrated plan to achieve the objectives of adequate, stable and nutritious supplies of food throughout the Caribbean Region. If implemented, the policy would secure higher food production; better health and nutrition; income and employment opportunities; and poverty alleviation. The COTED and the Council for Human and Social Development (COHSOD) have both approved the blueprint of the Regional Policy during the month of October 2010. The COHSOD acknowledged the critical link between education and food and nutrition security and agreed that a focal team from within the education sector would be nominated to support the implementation of the Regional Policy on Food and Nutrition Security.

					<p>Aflasafe® is a win-win formula for African farmers and investors that uses otherwise harmless fungi to control those that produce deadly aflatoxins in maize and peanut. The biological control of aflatoxins using aflasafe has rekindled hopes of a brighter future for African farmers battling crop contamination even as it opened doors for the private sector looking to invest in a winning formula in the continent's agriculture sector. The aflasafe technology, which uses “good” fungus to fight the “bad” ones, has provided relief to hundreds of maize farmers in northern Nigeria, a region where more than 70% of the population depend on agriculture for at least part of their livelihood. According to Ranajit Bandyopadhyay, IITA (Ibadan, Nigeria) plant pathologist, and Irmgard Hoeschle-Zeledon, coordinator of the CGIAR's Systemwide Program on Integrated Pest Management, an initial investment of US$1-3 million in an aflasafe manufacturing plant is likely to reap investors about N20 million ($1.33 million) annually. Bandyopadhyay indicated that an investment in an aflasafe manufacturing plant in Nigeria would pay off considering the huge demand for quality maize in the country and its neighbours.

	Dr. Sheila Okoth, leading an interdisciplinary and farmer participatory project on Conservation and Sustainable Management of Belowground Biodiversity (CSM-BGBD) is in the process of finding a sustainable solution to fungal contamination and mycotoxin production in foods, including aflatoxins. Aflatoxins are toxic, carcinogenic by-products of fungi that colonise maize and groundnuts, among other crops. Okoth’s research findings revealed that African countries do not have cost-effective technologies that can be used to reduce the risk of human and animal exposure to aflatoxin contamination. IFPRI, Washington, USA, has also launched a research project to find cost-effective methods of handling aflatoxin contaminations. Currently attached to the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa on a fellowship sponsored by the African Women in Agricultural Research and Development program, Okoth is studying possibilities, in collaboration with the university’s Department of Plant Pathology, of developing aflatoxin-resistant maize lines. The project includes collaboration between five institutions in Kenya and 120 farmers in agro-ecological regions (Embu and Taita Districts, Kenya) demonstrating alternative methods of farm management.

	Learn-Grow (LG) Solomon Islands project will be jointly carried out by the Rotary club of Devonport North, Australia, the Rotary club of Honiara and Food Plants International. The project was launched by permanent secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Edward Kingmele yesterday in Honiara. The objective of the project is to increase understanding and value of local food plants in enhanced nutrition and food security. Chairman of LG committee Buz Green said the principle aim is to increase knowledge and understanding of the food plants occurring in the Solomon Islands whether they are native plants or introduced. The LG project is based on a life time of work by a Tasmanian Agriculturist Reg French who has collated a database of edible plants for all countries of the world. By far the project, with the assistance of the two Rotary clubs, has helped to create publications on the local food plants. The publications include the reference book titled ‘Food Plants of Solomon Islands’. He appealed to Solomon Islanders to come up with local <i>pijin</i> names for food plants, advocate for local food plants, and provide as many photos of food plants for the project.

	Financed by the European Commission (FP7), the 4-year ‘AFTER’ project, launched in September 2010 and coordinated by CIRAD, France, involves interdisciplinary teams from seven countries in Africa (Benin, Cameroon, Ghana, Egypt, Madagascar, Senegal, South Africa) and four in Europe (France, Italy, Portugal, United Kingdom). Its aim is to acquire knowledge of the current know-how, consumption habits, technologies and processes associated with the following three traditional food products groups: fermented, cereal-based foods, meat and dried fish products, and products based on plant extracts. The project will propose ways of optimizing the traditional processes so as to improve the products’ sanitary and nutritional quality while maintaining or improving their organoleptic characteristics. Market accessibility will also be assessed with consumer tests to determine product acceptability criteria. The results obtained will be tested by African small- and medium-sized food enterprises involved in the project, before being disseminated in the form of guidelines that can be used by firms willing to produce these products.

	The town of Genadendal is the focus of a new indigenous knowledge project that aims to establish the town’s small farmers as independent producers of a unique African herbal tea. The project, which will run for three years until 2012, is funded by South Africa’s Department of Science and Technology. ‘We believe that the specific type of honeybush that grows naturally in the Genadendal area holds significant economic potential that can be unlocked to the benefit of the local community,’ explains project leader Professor Lizette Joubert, a researcher at the Agricultural Research Council’s (ARC) Infruitec Nietvoorbij Research Institute in Stellenbosch. ARC researchers will work closely with the Genadendal Small Farmers’ Association led by local community leader Reverend Chris Wessels. They will set up a demonstration plot and develop guidelines for nursery operations, farming practices and tea processing to help new farmers get started. The next step will be to optimise the processing of the tea, based on the community’s traditions. The project also aims to add value to the locally produced honeybush by looking at the production of extracts that can be used in many applications in the food and cosmetics industries.

	The 20th Meeting of the CARICOM Council for Human and Social Development (COHSOD), that took place 18-20 October 2010, in Georgetown, Guyana, saw Education ministers meet to discuss Regional Accreditation for Education and Training, Regional Standards for Teacher Education, Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) and Secondary Education Reform and the Caribbean Examination Council (CXC). The Vice Chancellor of the University of the West Indies, Prof. Nigel Harris, presented the paper titled ‘Towards a Regional Education System’, and examined issues related to the development of a Regional Tertiary Education System but will also make specific proposals for the establishment of a Tertiary Education Council. The discussion addressed issues in research and development and innovation and focused on the systemic and structural requirements necessary for developing countries such as those in the Caribbean Community to benefit from investments in science and technology. The Panel explored the place of Technical and Vocational Education and Training at the tertiary level. (Source: CARICOM Secretariat, 13 October 2010)

	The power of open access (OA) publishing to enhance the impacts of research is highlighted by a new study carried out by scientists in Canada and the UK and published in the journal PLoS ONE. The researchers hope their findings will encourage more universities, research institutions and research funders to adopt OA self-archiving mandates, in which all research published under their auspices is made freely available to other researchers. Articles that are made freely available in OA repositories tend to be cited more often than similar articles that can only be viewed by paying subscribers. The reasons for this have been the subject of much debate. The European Commission is also running an OA pilot project, under which projects funded under 7 areas of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) must be deposited in an online depository and made OA 6 or 12 months after publication. The pilot is set to run until the end of FP7 and if successful, it could serve as a model for future framework programmes. (Source: Cordis, 19 October 2010)</p>

	A recent study led by Michel Pimpert of the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED, London, UK), has, for the first time, properly consulted small African farmers on how to solve the problem of feeding sub-Saharan Africa. The farmers’ answers appear to directly repudiate a massive international effort to launch an African Green Revolution funded in large part by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Instead of new hybrid seeds, chemical fertilisers and pesticides, family farmers in West Africa said they want to use local seeds, avoid spending precious cash on chemicals and most importantly to direct public agricultural research to meet their needs, according to a multi-media publication released on World Food Day (Oct. 16). The report reveals that there is a clear vision from these small farmers, and that they reject the approach of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA). (Source: IPS, 16 October 2010)</p>

	Results of the European FLOW-AID project coordinated by Wageningen UR Greenhouse Horticulture in the Netherlands, show that sensors and decision-support software can help horticultural growers worldwide to reduce their water consumption by 60 percent and use 30 percent less fertiliser without sacrificing yield and quality. The project brought together scientists and developers from industry from eight countries. The FLOW-AID research results have been discussed during the international Horti Fair in Amsterdam in October 2010. (Source: alphagalileo.org, 15 October 2010)</p>

	Dov Pasternak, an agricultural scientist with the Niger hub of the India-based ICRISAT, announced new progress in disseminating an innovative system for irrigated vegetable production called the ‘African Market Garden’. Speaking at the African Green Revolution Forum that took place 2-4 september 2010 in Accra Ghana, Pasternak explained that ‘the “African Market Garden” combines efficient drip irrigation to save water, energy and labor with improved crop management to boost farmers' vegetable yields and economic returns.’ The centrepiece of the new system is a, low-pressure drip irrigation unit, which is installed in a field that comprises clusters measuring 500 square meters. The African Market Garden drastically reduces one of the main limitations of traditional vegetable growing - its excessive labor and energy requirements. In addition to the reduced drudgery for women and lower production costs, the system of community market gardening makes the new system more accessible to farmers by better enabling them to manage the set-up costs.
