						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	Synthetic biology and ethics: Building public trust</b><i>Julian Kinderlerer, President, European Group on Ethics, Professor, Intellectual Property Law, University of Cape Town, South Africa, Professor, Biotechnology &amp; Society, Delft University of Technology, Netherlands</i>The science of synthetic biology has become of great interest in the last few years, with major studies being commissioned to examine the implications of this new technology. In 2009, President Barosso, President of the European Commission, requested an Opinion of the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) on the ethics of synthetic biology (EGE, 2009). In this request he indicated that “the debate about the legitimacy of engineering new life forms has mainly focused on safety issues and a work on the ethical, legal and social implications that may derive from this specific use of biotechnology is still missing.” In US President Obama’s letter to the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues (2010), he asked for a consideration of “the potential medical, environmental, security and other benefits of this field of research as well as any potential health, security and other risks.” The issues had been highlighted in May 2010 “by the announcement that scientists at the J. Craig Venter Institute had created the world’s first self-replicating synthetic genome (human-made from chemical parts) in a bacterial cell of a different species” (Gibson et al., 2010).The European Academies Science Advisory Council (EASAC, 2010) considered the scientific and governance implications of synthetic biology and reported on ‘Realising European Potential in Synthetic Biology: Scientific Opportunities and Good Governance.’ It is therefore clear that the technologies and science involved in what is termed ‘synthetic biology’ are raising major issues, at least within international political circles. Building public confidence in the governance of synthetic biology by following ethical principles and standards is critical. But what are the issues, and why is there concern?<a href="/Media/Multimedia/Synthetic-biology-and-ethics-Building-public-trust" target="_blank">Download the article</a>.</p>

	In his research titled <i>Influence of Roasting on the Phenolic Content and Antioxidant Activity of the Philippine Coffee</i>, Dr. Ruel M. Mojica (of Cavite State University, Philippines) found that degrees of roasting have significant effects on the antioxidant activity of both <i>Coffea robusta</i> and <i>C. liberica</i> samples. Findings here show that light roasted coffee gives the highest phenolic content and antioxidant activity among coffee samples roasted to varying degrees. In his report, roasted beans generally contain less polyphenols than green beans (as chlorogenic acid present in green coffee is degraded upon roasting). The research found that &quot;considerable increase&quot; in phenolic content occurred in light roast samples and began to decrease in medium roast to very dark roast samples (as was the antioxidant activities with an increase in the degree of roast).In a time of changing eating habits, food products containing antioxidants are popular as their health benefits are scientifically proven.This research by Dr. Mojica is featured in the BAR Chronicle (<a href="http://goo.gl/wZdZP" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/wZdZP</a>), the official monthly publication of the Bureau of Agricultural Research (BAR) of the Department of Agriculture of the Philippines. </p>

	This article is part of the Journal Development’s issue on the future of agriculture (<a href="http://goo.gl/JjAr4" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/JjAr4</a>). This article proposes African alternatives that honour farmers' rights and agricultural biodiversity and still permit sustainable food production.Andrew Mushita and Carol Thompson argue that while the ‘green revolution for Africa’ promotes private foreign ownership of genetically modified seeds and focuses on increased yields of a few crops, African alternatives honour farmers' rights and agricultural biodiversity, through innovative legislation and protocols, in order to increase sustainable food production.The authors explain how the global agricultural crises have affected the African continent. Starting with exploring the dud that are agrofuels and the profound multi-faceted market failures of agricultural corporate policy, the authors then move to examine impacts of the piracy of African biodiversity wealth. At a later point, they carry their analysis to the African alternatives “that are working on the ground”, and focus on the Farmers’ rights international principle and the African Union Model Law for the protection of rights of local communities, farmers and breeders.Pambazuka republished recently the article at <a href="http://goo.gl/SZPPd" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/SZPPd</a>.(Source: Pambazuka, 24 Mar. 2011; Photo credit: Neil Palmer CIAT)</p>

	University of British Columbia researchers have produced the first map of the world outlining the ease of fluid flow through the planet's porous surface rocks and sediments. The maps and data, published in Geophysical Research Letters (January 2011), could help improve water resource management and climate modelling, and eventually lead to new insights into a range of geological processes.Using recent world-wide lithology (rock type) results from researchers at the University of Hamburg (Germany) and Utrecht University (The Netherlands); the authors were able to map permeability across the globe to depths of approximately 100 metres. Typical permeability maps have only dealt with the top one to two metres of soil, and only across smaller areas.
 A better understanding of large scale permeability of rock and sediment is critical for water resource management. Groundwater represents approximately 99 % of the fresh, unfrozen water on earth. Groundwater also feeds surface water bodies and moistens the root zone of terrestrial plants.(Source: Science Daily, 25 Jan. 2011) </p>

	The Soils, Food and Healthy Communities (SFHC, <a href="http://soilandfood.org" target="_blank">http://soilandfood.org</a>) project in Ekwendeni, northern Malawi, began in 2000 with thirty farmers, and is now working with over 4000 farmers. It is a participatory project, in which farmers try to improve soil fertility, food security and nutrition through the use of grain or perennial legumes (e.g. peanut or soyabean). Subsequently it is hoped that this will lead to an increased food productivity which will in turn enhance food availability within households of resource-poor farmers. The end goal is to improve food security, soil fertility, and child nutritional status.The research done by SFHC project has taken an ‘Ecohealth’ approach. An ecosystem approach takes a holistic approach to understanding how humans interact with their environment, and the implications for human health. The SFHC research project attempts to improve child nutritional status, household food security and soil fertility through use of different legume options which can improve the quality and quantity of food available within the household as well as provide organic inputs to improve soil fertility. The project’s approach sits on the three following concepts of : 


<i>Transdisciplinarity</i> (involve people from multiple disciplines in carrying out research and in analysis and dialogue about research findings and development activities);

<i>Participation</i> (use a participatory approach, rely on input from the Farmer Research Team and villages committees, assuming resource-poor farmers have valuable knowledge to contribute to the assessment of organic matter technologies for improving food security and health);

<i>Equity and gender</i> (integrating equity concerns into programming and research activities). 


A recent paper has been published using data from the project, seeRachel Bezner Kerr, Peter R Berti and Lizzie Shumba. <i>Effects of a participatory agriculture and nutrition education project on child growth in northern Malawi</i>. <b>Public Health Nutrition</b>, 09 Nov 2010, pp. 1-7.

	EDES is an ACP-EU programme funded by the 9th European Development Fund. It involves nine partners from France, the United Kingdom, Belgium and Denmark, and is working within a global framework of support of poverty alleviation through economic development. CIRAD is coordinating the programme's training component.&quot;Starting in 2011, we will be training 6000 people in the concept of food safety, in more than 35 countries &quot; says Didier Montet, coordinator of the team of twelve CIRAD researchers working on the project. &quot;We will be beginning in April with a course for ACP training staff. Some 20% of the work will be done in the private sector &quot;.The aim is to improve the food safety of ACP foodstuffs exported to Europe. Such goods must comply with regulation 882/2004, which means bringing all these food products into line with European regulatory systems. The aim is to alleviate poverty in ACP countries by maintaining their access to the European, and also the local and regional, market.Specific modules have been developed for the following training sessions :


food safety governance

official controls

good practice in international trade

launch and monitoring of official control laboratories

risk analysis and management

communication on risks.

	Stanford agricultural scientist David Lobell and researchers at CIMMYT report in the inaugural issue of <i>Nature Climate Change</i> (<a href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.nature.com/nclimate/index.html</a>) that a clear negative effect of warming on maize production was evident in experimental crop trial data conducted in Africa by the organization and its partners from 1999 to 2007. Led by Lobell, the researchers combined data from 20,000 trials in sub-Saharan Africa with weather data recorded at stations scattered across the region. They found that a temperature rise of a single degree Celsius would cause yield losses for 65 percent of the present maize-growing region in Africa - provided the crops received the optimal amount of rainfall. The data recorded at the yield testing sites did not include weather information. Instead, the researchers used data gathered from weather stations all over sub-Saharan Africa. Although the stations were operated by different organizations, all data collection was organized by the World Meteorological Organization, so the methods used were consistent. Lobell then took the available weather data and interpolated between recording stations to infer what the weather would have been like at the test sites. By merging the weather and crop data, the researchers could examine climate impacts.Source: Sciencedaily, 14 Mar. 2011, see <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110313160025.htm" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110313160025.htm </a>and The Economist, 17 Mar. 2011, see <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18386161" target="_blank">http://www.economist.com/node/18386161</a></p>

	Low-input farming for cocoa, cassava and oil palm has resulted in widespread deforestation and degredation of West Africa’s tropical forest area, according to a new study by researchers at the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR). Researchers found that increasing fertilizer use on cocoa-timber farms would have spared roughly 2 million hectares of tropical forest from being cleared or severely degraded. The study suggests that farmers could have achieved the same outputs without rampant deforestation through the intensified use of fertilizer and agrochemicals coupled with improved crop husbandry.According to IITA, by doing so farmers would have doubled their incomes and helped to avoid deforestation and degradation on 2.1 million hectares and in the process, this would have generated a value of over 1,600 million dollars on 1.3 billion tons of CO2 emissions that would not have come from deforestation. To the authors, funding support for reducing carbon emissions due to deforestation and degradation (REDD) to mitigate climate change offers the potential of significant new public resources for needed investments in agricultural research and extension and market infrastructure to support the transformation of traditional agriculture in West Africa. They suggest a significant proportion of REDD+ funding should be used to increase the adoption level of fertilizer use in a ‘Fertilizers for forest’ mitigation program.

	The Agroecological Knowledge toolkit (AKT5) software was developed by the Bangor University (Wales, UK) in conjunction with the Department of Artificial Intelligence at Edinburgh University (<a href="http://akt.bangor.ac.uk/index.php.en?menu=0&amp;catid=0%20" target="_blank">http://akt.bangor.ac.uk/index.php.en?menu=0&amp;catid=0</a>). The Bangor University of Wales is a leading institution in the development of a knowledge-based systems methodology to acquire and use local knowledge in research and development. The AKT5 system is primarily concerned with gathering local ecological knowledge (LEK). Local ecological knowledge refers to what people know about their natural environment, based primarily on their own experience and observation.It was designed to provide an environment for knowledge acquisition in order to create knowledge bases from a range of sources. It The AKT5 allows representation of knowledge elicited from farmers and scientists or knowledge abstracted from written material. The use of formal knowledge representation procedures offers researchers the ability to evaluate and utilise the often complex, qualitative information relevant stakeholders have on agroecological practices.Visit: <a href="http://www.worldagroforestrycentre.org/af2/akt5" target="_blank">http://www.worldagroforestrycentre.org/af2/akt5</a></p>

	Reference: Bruno Rapidel, Fabrice DeClerck, Jean-François Le Coq and John Beer; <i>Ecosystem services from agriculture and agroforestry: Measurement and payment</i>; Earthscan Editions, 2011.A book about payments for the ecosystem services rendered by farming systems, presenting the methodological difficulties associated with the quantification and marketing of such services, and practical case studies. Farming systems are no longer assessed solely based on the food they supply, but also on their capacity to limit environmental impact, and their contribution to the attenuation of and adaptation to climate change. They have to internalize the costs and advantages of their impact on the environment. Payments for ecosystem services have to encourage and promote sustainable practices through financial incentives. The authors demonstrate that while this is simple in principle, it is much more complex in practice. The first two chapters present the methodological problems associated with the quantification and marketing of the ecosystem services rendered by agriculture, including agroforestry. The third and last part presents case studies of the implementation of payments for ecosystem services and trials in central Europe and South America. It draws some lessons from the sustainable, effective development of compensation mechanisms for environmental services rendered. </p>

	The <i>Suwon Agrobiodiversity Framework</i> (<a href="http://goo.gl/8OKgp" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/8OKgp</a>) is the result of discussions held in Korea at the “Sustainable Agriculture Development and Use of Agrobiodiversity in the Asia-Pacific Region” International Symposium in October 2010. The symposium provided an opportunity to review, identify, and redefine the role and directions of agricultural R&amp;D, especially in the context of conservation through use of valuable agrobiodiversity for sustainable agricultural development. It did also set a vision for the access and the benefit sharing of valuable genetic resources. To address the questions at hand, the organizations thought best to adopt an integrated systems approach while defining the framework: research and S&amp;T developments are to focus on genetic resources, conservation techniques, traditional knowledge, ecosystem services, and rely on information and communication systems to enhance regional collaboration.

	“<b>Plantwise</b>” is a collaborative project, led by the Centre for Agricultural Bioscience International (CABI, UK), that will combine self-sustaining networks of free, community-based ‘plant clinics’ with a central Plantwise Knowledge Bank, creating a global vigilance system that will help prepare farmers to fight the pests and diseases that can ravage their crops.The project received funding from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) to support the training of plant doctors and establishing hundreds of clinics in 40 countries over the next five years: the programme is to deliver a wide range of agricultural advice and services, and strengthen local and regional plant health networks.
 The plant clinics will follow the model already established by CABI in fifteen countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The clinics advise farmers on all aspects of plant health in the way a doctor does for humans. They are run by local technical people, known as plant doctors, who set up the clinics in rural marketplaces or other places where farmers congregate. Farmers drop by with samples of their plants to get the problem identified and to learn what to do about it. Studies of clinics in Bangladesh and Bolivia have shown that, as a result of the clinics, farmers have increased crop yields and spent less money on inappropriate or excessive use of pesticides, increasing their average household income and improving livelihoods. The plant clinics will operate in conjunction with the Plantwise Knowledge Bank, a prototype of which is due to launch in mid- 2011. (Source: CABI, April 2011)</p>

					<p>Rice is Madagascar’s main staple crop and ‘Dista’ rice, which is cultivated in the Toamasina province near Lake Alaotra (in the northern central plateau of Madagascar), is named after the farmer who discovered it.The rice, a pale pink color, smells like cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg, is very nutritious and yields are double that of other varieties.

	Dista rice also shatters less when milled, helping reduce post harvest losses and increasing farmers’ income.Dista yields are also high for another reason: farmers are using the “Système de Riziculture Intensive” to cultivate it (see <a href="http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/index.html" target="_blank">http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/index.html</a> for “System of Rice Intensification”, SRI). SRI practices include transplanting seedlings when they are very young and growing them widely apart, adding compost from organic matter to the soil, weeding regularly, and using a minimum amount of water instead of flooding fields. This helps create deep root systems that are better able to resist drought, while also increasing yields, strengthening the plant, and enhancing its flavour.

	Researchers at Kenya University Botanic Garden are trying to re-establish jute mallow and similar vegetables as staples in the African diet. Jute mallow is a nutritious leafy vegetable with a long history and a variety of names (originating from Egypt, it is also called ‘Egyptian spinach’). The leaves are very nutritious, rich in iron, protein, calcium, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, and dietary fiber. When cooked, the leaves exude a slimy jelly which many liken to the texture of okra, prompting the name ‘Bush okra’. The vegetable has almost as many varieties as it does names (more than 15 in total). 
The most widely cultivated species is <i>Corchorus olitorius</i>, but all of the varieties are all edible and widely cultivated. The jute mallow is harvestable three to four weeks after planting, can be re-harvested three or four times a season, and doesn’t require artificial fertilizer. Farmers can harvest six to ten tons per hectare and jute mallow can be planted in rotation with other crops, resulting in healthier plants that are more resistant to damage by pests. Unfortunately, despite these benefits, jute mallow has largely gone ignored by researchers, leading to a lack of quality seed, as well as indigenous knowledge about cultivation practices.(Source: Worldwatch Institute blog, 12 Mar. 2011) </p>

	The Marie Curie Initial Training Network (ITN) project, “Biochemical and Genetic Dissection of Control of Plant Nutrition” (also known as “Bionut”), brings together eight of Europe’s top plant research institutes, lead by scientists from the John Innes Centre (UK).
 
Each institute will host one PhD student, and the studentships will be linked to ensure that a fully integrated approach is taken to get the whole picture of plant nutrition. This integration is a key feature of the network, as it advances the science beyond focussing on one mineral nutrient, such as nitrogen or sulphur, to look at the combined nutritional needs of the plant. The results will be brought together to produce the most complete mathematical model of plant nutrition to date. This European research initiative will take steps to understand how crop plants use available nutrients, and address the need for crop varieties that produce higher yields with lower inputs and reduced environmental impact.
 The integrated approach adopted by the initiative will draw on the complementary skills and specialties of the research groups. Geneticists will screen for undiscovered genes involved in controlling plant nutrition, and systems biologists, biochemists and plant physiologists will combine to work out the functions of these genes. Other partners will focus on the translation of this research into crop plants in the field, ensuring the pipeline from the laboratory to the field is fully covered by this project.

	IFPRI has published a new policy report. Building on the strategic recommendations of various highly influential reports and meetings, and taking into account the various investment and capacity challenges outlined in the <i>African agricultural R&amp;D in the new millennium</i> report (<a href="http://goo.gl/1FIKK" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/1FIKK</a>). The authors suggest that four key areas with strong implications for policy must be addressed by governments, donors, and other stakeholders:


decades of underinvestment in agricultural R&amp;D;

excessive volatility in yearly investment levels;

existing and imminent challenges in human resource capacity; and

the need to maximize regional and subregional cooperation in agricultural R&amp;D.


Notwithstanding the challenges facing many countries, renewed commitment to agricultural R&amp;D by governments and donors indicates improved prospects for agricultural R&amp;D for a number of African countries. The report states that regional initiatives are also a key factor in increasing research coordination and collaboration and ensuring the prioritization and efficiency of research.Nature analyses the report: <i>Rise in African agricultural research spending hampered by instability</i><a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110407/full/news.2011.219.html" target="_blank">http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110407/full/news.2011.219.html</a>)</p>

	Norway is reviewing its research system through the “Fagerberg Committee”. One study commissioned by the committee compares the research system in seven countries, with an emphasis on publically financed research. The comparison of the countries uses seven criteria to assess what instruments offer most value for money. Relevant data suggest a declining role of basic research in the sense of 'blue skies' (curiosity-driven) research.
 Looking at who decides the research topics reveals that any drift away from basic research is the choice of the research community itself: the share of researcher-initiated project funding is clearly rising.The first publication volume of the research, Research Support for the Fagerberg Committee - International comparison of goal-oriented public governance in research policy, can be downloaded at <a href="http://goo.gl/uR7Hp" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/uR7Hp</a>.Public funding allocation to the main research sectors is described and allocation patterns mapped over time. It also gives information on research spending versus research administration, examines research recruitment, identifies mechanisms and criteria for public research allocation, and in particular how targets are operationalised. It also covers a review of bibliometric systems developed for cataloguing research production (number and level of publications, quotations indexes) and gives some best cases examples.
 Comparative data for the seven countries studied appears in a second volume, which can be downloaded at <a href="http://goo.gl/qm8cM" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/qm8cM</a>. Such a review exercise should help other countries assess their research system, relevant in the current context of research policy reviews taking place in several regions of the world.</p>

	The Minister of Higher education and University, Léonard Mashako Mamba laid the first stone at the University of Kinshasa, DRC (UNIKIN) for the construction of an agricultural research center, financed by Korean project KOPIA/DRC.This center has to reinforce the research that contributes to the modernisation and promotion of agriculture in DRC. Once built the research centre will provide farmers with seeds and machinery, to help them improve the quality and quantity of their products. The action also aims at the promotion of scientific research at UNIKIN.The Korean Rural Development Administration set up KOPIA (Korea Project on International Agriculture) centres in countries including Vietnam, Kenya, DRC, Brazil, Uzbekistan and Myanmar to spread Korea's customized agricultural technology. For example, the KOPIA centre in Kenya built and operates vinyl greenhouses, poultry farms and distributed agricultural machines such as bicycle-turned thrashers and rice planting machines in order to help the region's farming activities.(Source: digitalcongo.net, 14 Mar. 2011)</p>

	The Centre for Higher Education Transformation (CHET, South Africa) has published a synthesis report drawing together evidence from eight African case studies that formed part of the Higher Education Research and Advocacy Network in Africa project (HERANA, <a href="http://chet.org.za/programmes/herana/" target="_blank">http://chet.org.za/programmes/herana/</a>). The HERANA research surveyed higher education stakeholders in eight African countries: Botswana, Ghana, Nairobi (Kenya), Mauritius, Eduardo Mondlane (Mozambique), Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), Makerere (Uganda), Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University and the University of Cape Town Both in South Africa).The study revealed that flagship universities in these eight African countries are more similar to institutions elsewhere than is generally perceived, with well-qualified staff, positive student-to-staff ratios, and rising enrolments including in science, engineering and technology.
