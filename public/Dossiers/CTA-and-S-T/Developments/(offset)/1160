						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	Matt Busse, with the USDA Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Research Station (PSW, Albany, USA), measured the soil-heat pulse when burning heavy concentrations of woody residues to determine the optimal soil moisture conditions needed to limit soil damage. The study funded by the Joint Fire Science Program and the National Fire Plan, revealed that soil-moisture content greater than 20 percent by volume effectively quenched the heat pulse in a wide variety of soils. From these findings, a predictive model was presented that allows fire. Results from the study were published in the May-June 2010 issue of the Soil Science Society of America Journal. <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/busse/psw_2010_busse001.pdf" target="_blank">View PDF</a> (Source: Pacific Southwest Research Station, July 2010)</p>

	Conservation International (CI, Arlington, USA) published a series of reports showing that marine managed areas in developing countries can help reverse declining fisheries while generating long-term benefits for communities. The reports, informed by more than 50 studies and 100 scientists in 23 countries around the world since 2005, evaluate the role of marine managed areas (MMAs) in maintaining ocean health, assess the link between sustainable ocean use and human well-being, and architect what it takes to successfully implement MMAs. The reports argue that MMAs will be critical to halt continuing the decline in marine fisheries. The reports were produced by a global network of 75 organizations known as the ‘Science-to-Action’ partnership, primarily under a grant from The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.

	A collaborative team of scientists, led by researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin (USA) has made a <a href="http://www.nature.com/nsmb/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nsmb.1887.html" target="_blank">significant advance</a> on the discovery last year of pyrabactin (by Sean Cutler of the University of California, Riverside). Pyrabactin is a synthetic chemical that mimics a naturally produced stress hormone in plants to help them cope with drought conditions. Plants naturally produced a stress hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), in modest amounts to help them survive drought by inhibiting growth. ABA has already been commercialized for agricultural use. But it has at least two disadvantages: it is light-sensitive and costly to make. Pyrabactin, on the other hand, is relatively inexpensive, easy to make, and not sensitive to light. But its drawback is that, unlike ABA, it does not turn on all the ‘receptors’ in the plant that need to be activated for drought-tolerance to fully take hold. By understanding how pyrabactin works and with more research like the current one, the drawbacks of pyrabactin can be studied, and other more effective chemicals can be developed more readily for bringing drought-resistance to plants.

	Solomon Gelalcha, Director of Kulumsa Agricultural Research Center (KARC, Kulumsa, Ethiopia) one of the organizations under the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research said two new wheat varieties were developed by researchers at Kulumsa through a new approach called ‘Durable Rust Resistance in Wheat’ (DRRW). These new varieties are resistant to multiple current and possible future wheat killer pathogens of yellow, stem and leave wheat rusts. The DRRW approach focuses on giving the new wheat varieties durability against any wheat disease. The previous model gave varieties ‘vertical resistance’ to a single disease, and is easily defeated by new diseases or when the disease they are resistant to evolves. Kulumsa is attempting to release the new varieties of wheat before having them officially approved. (Source: ISP, 17 September 2010)</p>

	Scientists in Nigeria and six other African nations are experimenting with a fast-yielding, disease-resistant species of cassava. The results so far are glowing: the new plants stand taller, and appear stronger and more vibrant. When their tubers are pulled from the ground, they resemble fat, oversized fingers. The cassava stems are not genetically-modified. They were obtained through a conventional process of breeding and selection over more than a decade. Researchers at IITA, Ibadan, Nigeria, are distributing the stems to local farmers free of charge. They hope to get the improved cassava into 75,000 farms by the end of the year to increase yields in seven selected Nigerian states. The first results have been promising, scientists and farmers say. The project is financed by USAID and targets about 400,000 farmers in seven African nations: Sierra Leone, Ghana, Tanzania, Malawi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique and Nigeria.

	The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, Hon. Dr. Christopher Tufton, has said that the country's agricultural sector must become more globally competitive, to be sustainable. &quot;We have to help our farmers to be creative, to be innovative, to do the best practices, but to focus on quality output of the limited quantities that they can determine; and we are going to have to integrate our primary products into a value-added stage to create brands that can be recognised as unique and special,&quot; he said. He was speaking at the opening ceremony of a National Farmer Experimentation and Innovation Workshop for Extension Officers, hosted by the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Co-operation (CTA, Wageningen, The Netherlands) in collaboration with the Rural Agricultural and Development Authority (RADA, Jamaica), at the Mona Visitors' Lodge and Conference Centre, University of the West Indies (UWI, Jamaica Campus), on 28 September 2010.

According to the project coordinator, Diogene Mulindahabi, the goal of the project is to improve science and technology and industrial skills base by building the capacity of female students. At least 100 girls will, by the end of this year, be selected to join higher institutions of learning pursuing science and technology courses. The young women are currently undergoing a six-month training in science subjects, were selected from all over the country with the help of the national examinations body. The programme will help raise the participation of women in science and technology fields which is still weak at the level of higher education. (Source: AllAfrica, 21 August 2010)</p>

The kits, which contain basic science equipment, accessories, charts and models, where distributed in every provincial state. They are meant to improve the quality of teaching and learning, as well as to change the negative perception that students have about science subjects. Nigeria’s Minister of Education, Prof. Ruqayyatu Rufa'I, said the intervention was a wakeup call for states to complement the federal government effort by procuring more kits until all junior secondary schools have adequately benefited from the initiative.

	The regional meeting of the International Network of Women Engineers and Scientists (INWES) took place on 26-27 August 2010 at the headquarters of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Washington DC. Representatives from 11 countries, including England, Poland, France, Japan, South Korea, Rwanda, and Egypt attended the conference. The conference was ‘part of a much larger global effort to improve women's position in regard to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)...as well as to improve women's empowerment and development by way of STEM,’ said Shirley Malcom, director of Education and Human Resources at AAAS. It focused on workforce and economic development for women scientists and engineers. (Source: American Association for the Advancement of Science, 21 September 2010)</p>

	The Secretariat of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP Secretariat) has issued an open call for proposals for research projects in the Caribbean and Pacific regions. These research projects will be part of the ACP Research for Sustainable Development Programme. This programme focuses on the support for research and innovation initiatives from ACP stakeholders. The targeted areas in the C&amp;P countries to benefit from this new programme are ‘post-harvest and agriculture’, ‘renewable and sustainable energy’, ‘water &amp; sanitation’ and ’climate change’. The programme has been developed as complementary to other ACP and/or EU initiatives such as the EDULINK Programme, the ACP Science &amp; Technology Programme and the FP7 Framework Programme for Research. It is further complemented by initiatives such as the ACP Water and Energy Facilities which, although not focused on research, provide capacity building as well as improved access to water and sanitation and to sustainable and affordable energy as well as by other bilateral and multilateral initiatives in research cooperation such as those sponsored for example by UNDP, CGIAR and ACIAR. <b>Deadline for submission of proposals: 31st January 2011</b></p>

					<p>At the 5th African Agriculture Science Week, hosted by the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA) experts from the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) told researchers that urgent action is needed to stop the rapid and alarming loss of genetic diversity of African livestock, the livelihood of 70 percent of rural Africans and a treasure-trove of drought- and disease-resistant animals. On the basis of a new analysis, the scientists were urged to expand their efforts to identify and preserve the unique traits, particularly in West Africa, of the continent's rich array of cattle, sheep, goats and pigs developed over several millennia but now under siege. ILRI's push to preserve Africa's indigenous livestock is part of a broader effort to improve productivity on African farms through what is known as 'landscape genomics'. Landscape genomics involves, among other things, sequencing the genomes of different livestock varieties from many regions and looking for the genetic signatures associated with their suitability to a particular environment.

					<p>From the land of dams and canals comes a new device billed as the saviour of agriculture and reforestation in drought-plagued areas. The ‘Waterboxx’, an invention of Dutch businessman Pieter Hoff, collects rainwater and condensation and funnels it to the plant. Experiments with the device are now under way in Kenya, Morocco, Spain and the United States. To start, the farmer fills the box half with 2 gallons of water. Any condensation or rain is theoretically enough to keep the box filled and supplying enough water to the plant via the wick. The device is stoppered with a siphon to prevent evaporation. The box has to be oriented in such as way that the oblong opening in the center points east-west and shades the plant from the sun during the hottest part of the day. The box is removed after the plant’s roots have reached the groundwater. The ‘Waterboxx’ can be used over and over again. (Source: Scientific American, 1 July 2010)</p>
