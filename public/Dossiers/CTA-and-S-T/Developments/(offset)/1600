						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>The Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development said it has distributed and gained reliable results from two drought and weed-resistant varieties of sorghum discovered by, Professor Gebisa Ejeta who was named the winner of the <a href="http://www.worldfoodprize.org/press_room/2009/june/ejeta.htm" target="_blank">2009 World Food Prize</a> on June 18, 2009. On of the species, named Abshir, is being produced in a large scale in Shire, Tigray State. The other, Gubeye, in Wollo area of Amhara State registered positive results in withstanding diseases. Currently the variety is being distributed to other areas of the country, Dr. Abera, State Minister of MoARD said. The Ethiopian researcher also made similar researches in West Africa and his discoveries are being used in other parts of the world exposed to food shortage. Prof. Gebisa Ejeta will receive the 250,000 USD award on October 15, 2009 in a ceremony, which will be organized by the World Food Prize Foundation in Des Moines, Iowa. President of the foundation, former U.S. ambassador to Cambodia Kenneth Quinn, said Gebisa's work with sorghum has benefited millions of people in Africa and beyond.

					<p>Universities in Africa have been ‘hollowed out’ by the steady stream of scientists moving to developed countries, according to the Network of African Science Academies (NASAC). The group has written to the G8+5 group of developed countries and emerging powers to call for greater investment in Africa's research infrastructure. The G8+5 meet in Italy next month and include heads of government from the G8, plus Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa. A third of all African scientists live and work in developed countries, according to NASAC, and this has crippled development efforts in Africa. It noted that just 1.4% of articles published in international peer-reviewed journals come from Africa. Developing science and technology infrastructure is critical to sustainable economic progress, according to a statement from the African scientists. The group wants developed nations to invest in the rebuilding of African universities, provide funding for scientists to pursue postgraduate and postdoctoral work in Africa, and to support links between Africa's diaspora and African-based scientists.

					<p>The international community has shown keen interest in Guyana’s efforts to combat climate change which is encompassed in the draft Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS). Consultations on the Strategy were launched on June 8, 2009 and President Bharrat Jagdeo highlighted the international partners who have shown their support and encouragement. In particular, Guyana has been working closely with Norway to determine how to generate performance-based compensation for forest climate services which will support the implementation of the LCDS. Also, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy has promised to include the issue of deforestation in the agenda of the upcoming G-8 meeting and Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton of the United States has pointed out that addressing forestry can also help accelerate a greater global understanding of the need for action on the broader climate change agenda. These partnerships’ intention is to support the creation of low-carbon employment and investment opportunities in Guyana; sustained efforts to avoid deforestation and forest degradation; strengthening transparent forest governance; and establishing an international monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) system for Guyana’s forests.

					<p>Climate change has contributed to a flattening of the complex, multi-layered architecture of Caribbean coral reefs, compromising their role as a nursery for fish stocks and a buffer against tropical storms, <a href="http://www.dulvy.com/publications/forthcoming/Alvarez_2009_PRSLB_proof.pdf" target="_blank">a study</a> on <a href="http://www.dulvy.com/publications/forthcoming/Alvarez_2009_PRSLB_proof.pdf" target="_blank">“Flattening of Caribbean coral reefs: region-wide declines in architectural complexity”</a> shows. The analysis of 500 surveys of 200 reefs, conducted between 1969 and 2008, showed the most complex types of reef had been virtually wiped out across the entire Caribbean. &quot;We suggest that the last period of decline is partly due to climate change, but also due to several other human impacts such as over-fishing and coastal development,&quot; Alvarez said. &quot;In future, we'll need to change our behavior and reduce the stress on the reefs.&quot; (Source: Caribbean Net News, 11June 2009)</p>

					<p>The appointment of South Africa's new minister of science and technology, Naledi Pandor, is a welcome step towards putting science for development at the centre of government policies, says an editorial in the <a href="http://www.scidev.net/uploads/File/pdffiles/sajsci_v105_n3_4_a1.pdf " target="_blank">South African Journal of Science</a>. Pandor is the first science minister for 15 years to be a member of the ruling party — and therefore to have access to the &quot;corridors of power&quot;, says the editorial. And her experience as education minister means she understands that the problem facing South African science lies in the school system. The editorial suggests that Pandor should take the bold step of putting all the research councils under the administration of the science ministry to better coordinate the nation's research efforts. Appointing a chief scientist to government may also help bring science to the fore, it adds. (Source: SciDev.net, 11 June 2009)</p>

					<p>On the first-ever UN World Oceans Day (June 8 2009) FAO has published a set of <a href="http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/newsroom/docs/i0816t.pdf" target="_blank">technical guidelines</a> aimed at helping the fisheries sector reduce its impacts on fragile deep-sea fish species and ecosystems.The guidelines provide a framework that countries can use, individually and in the context of regional fisheries management organizations, to manage deep sea fisheries (DSF) in high-seas areas outside of national jurisdictions. The guidelines prescribe steps for identifying and protecting vulnerable ocean ecosystems and provide guidance on the sustainable use of marine living resources in deep-sea areas. They also outline ways that information on the location and status of vulnerable marine ecosystems, including vulnerable deep-sea fish stocks, should be improved. (Source: FAO, 8 July 2009)</p>

					<p>Scientists have developed improved methods for identifying a bacterium devastating banana crops in East Africa, where the fruit is a staple part of the diet and an important part of the rural economy. Until now, banana <i>Xanthomonas wilt</i> (BXW) was diagnosed by symptoms alone. These include a progressive yellowing and wilting of leaves, premature ripening of fruit, brown discoloration of fruit and pale yellow ooze coming from cut surfaces, says Leena Tripathi, the study's lead author. The research team, including Steffen Abele, head of the Banana and Plantain Systems Program and research director at the new Dar es Salaam branch of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Tanzania, tried a variety of biochemical tests to identify the BXW pathogen in the laboratory. Tests that amplify and identify the pathogen's DNA were &quot;most reliable, as the infected plants can be tested even before the symptoms develop&quot;, says Tripathi, a biotechnologist at the IITA in Uganda.

					<p>The Global Crop Diversity Trust announced that it has entered into an agreement with the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) to protect the important collections of yams and edible aroids (taro) from different countries in the Pacific region. The Trust will provide USD 50,000 annually, in perpetuity, towards the long-term conservation of the collections held in-trust by the Centre for Pacific Crops and Trees (CePaCT). A significant portion of the fund was used to put up a new storage center, which will provide excellent facilities for long-term conservation of plant genetic resources. The center is set to open in September 2009. The SPC said that the partnership means a lot for the conservation of the region's crop diversity. The Trust noted that the importance of crop diversity to sustainable development in the Pacific region is becoming more and more apparent, especially as farmers try to maintain and improve food production in the face of a changing climate.

					<p>Farmers in Africa are helping to identify alternative farming techniques which will help them adapt to climate change. This participatory research is being conducted as part of the <a href="http://www.idrc.ca/ccaa/" target="_blank">Climate Change Adaptation in Africa programme</a> which is jointly funded by the UK's Department for International Development (DFID) and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC). The study, initiated in 2007, is working with smallholder farmers in Uganda, Tanzania, Ghana, Mali, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe. These countries represent a range of different climatic zones within Africa. As part of the study, learning centres have been established in each country where researchers, extension workers and suppliers of agricultural inputs, such as seeds and fertilizers, work together with farmers to identify which interventions would help to minimise vulnerability to climate change. The learning centres combine the use of local and traditional knowledge with new knowledge to test alternative farming practices such as using different crops and crop varieties, and various methods of improving soil fertility. Declining soil fertility was identified as a major challenge across all study sites, and is a major constraint to the efficient use of available water by crops. (Source: Leisa)</p>

					<p>
The Bonn Climate Change Talks took place from 1 till 12 June 2009 in Maritim, Bonn. Delegates from 182 countries met in Bonn to discuss, for the first time, key negotiating texts which can serve as the basis for an ambitious and effective international climate change deal, to be clinched in Copenhagen in December.The main focus in Bonn was to enhance international climate change cooperation, including in the post-2012 period when the first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol expires. The long-term issues were considered by the <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/items/4381.php" target="_blank">AWG-LCA</a> and <a href="http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/4577.php" target="_blank">AWG-KP</a> working groups, which are both scheduled to conclude their work by the 15th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15), to be held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December 2009. At the conclusion of the meetings, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer stated that an ambitious and effective agreed outcome in Copenhagen “is in sight,” highlighting that governments had made clearer what they want to see in this agreed outcome. He also called for an increase “in the level of ambition” regarding the emission reduction targets discussed by the AWG-KP, warning that the negotiating group was still far from the range set out by science to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.Visit the <a href="http://www.iisd.ca/climate/sb30/" target="_blank">IISD website</a> for the daily web coverage.</p>

					<p>Saying that vulnerable fishing and coastal communities around the world will bear the brunt of climate change's impacts, a group of 16 international organizations have urged climate negotiators to ensure that fisheries and aquaculture are not neglected in ongoing discussions regarding a successor to the Kyoto Protocol. In a <a href="ftp://ftp.fao.org/FI/brochure/climate_change/policy_brief.pdf" target="_blank">policy brief</a> issued on the first of June 2009 in advance of UNFCC talks held from 1 to 12 June 2009 in Bonn, Germany, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the World Bank, the WorldFish Center and 11 other organizations warned that millions of fishers, fish farmers and coastal inhabitants will experience less stable livelihoods, changes in the availability and quality of fish for food, and heightened risks to their health, safety and homes as a result of climate change. Research is required to understand the complex biological and chemical processes of aquatic ecosystems. Equally important is understanding how people adapt to living in a changing climate and how their institutions and livelihoods have evolved, and can further evolve, to maintain resilience in the face of future change.

An EU study of future agricultural research challenges stresses the need to conduct transdisciplinary research and redistribute roles between the state, markets and civil society to address the vulnerabilities of the present agri-food system. Despite growing consensus over the diagnosis that climate change, food security and rural development are the main challenges that should drive agricultural research, &quot;strong disagreements exist concerning solutions,&quot; notes <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/agriculture/scar/pdf/scar_2nd_foresight_exercise_en.pdf " target="_blank">the </a><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/agriculture/scar/pdf/scar_2nd_foresight_exercise_en.pdf " target="_blank">report New Challenges for Agricultural Research: Climate Change, Food Security, Rural Development, Agricultural Knowledge</a>, presented at a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/sd/conference/2009/index_en.cfm?pg=home " target="_blank">conference on the role of EU research in sustainable development</a> on May 27, 2009.
Disagreements exist both at political and scientific levels regarding the role of public sector and market liberalisation in solving social problems, as well as regarding the role of technology and innovation in solving agri-environmental issues. Other dilemmas include deciding whether sustainability or competitiveness should come first, determining the role of farmers and consumers in deciding the way forward, and over the role of intellectual property rights (IPR) in agri-innovation.

					<p>The Climate Change Adaptation in Africa programme (CCAA) launched in May 2009 the AfricaAdapt website, a new platform for sharing knowledge about climate change and adaptation. AfricaAdapt is a pan-African networking initiative. Originating from the CCAA supported project „Knowledge Sharing for Climate Change Adaptation in Africa, AfricaAdapt provides a means for researchers, policymakers, and all Africans affected by climate change to test new ways of sharing their experiences and challenges across barriers of distance, culture and language.</p>

<h2><a class="listing" style="link" href="/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/Science-Forum-2009" title="Science Forum 2009 " alt="link">Science Forum 2009 </a></h2>

	
					<p><a href="http://www.scienceforum2009.nl/" target="_blank">Science Forum 2009</a> took place in Wageningen, the Netherlands on 16 and 17 June 2009. The forum explored ways to mobilize science more effectively to enhance food security, improve nutrition, reduce poverty and to better manage natural resources. The Forum expected to serve both the CGIAR, the advanced research institutes (ARIs), national agricultural research services (NARS) and their current and prospective partners and beneficiaries to explore new applications of advanced science to address development challenges, and to highlight the potential for new linkages within the global research community. The forum focussed on innovative science and the arrangements that can help to mobilize it more effectively for development. Science Forum 2009 directly contributed towards the 2010 Global Conference on Agricultural Research for Development (GCARD) in seeking to inform both regional consultations and subsequent global discussion as to how advanced science can be more effectively, and efficiently, mobilized in support of development. On the following blog you can find <a href="http://en.wordpress.com/tag/science-forum-2009/" target="_blank">articles and impressions of the Science Forum 2009</a>.</p>
