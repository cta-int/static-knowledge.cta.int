						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Bill Tracy of University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA hopes to help organic farmers by breeding sweet corn that not only tastes good and yields well, but also competes strongly against weeds, naturally resists pests and diseases, and germinates early in the season. There may yet be another benefit. Unable to compete with the resource-rich breeding programs at private companies, public plant breeding programs at universities have been declining. Now, perhaps, organic breeding could offer a new niche. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://www.crops.org/story/2014/feb/wed/researchers-develop-new-breeds-of-crops-tailor-made-for-organic-farms" target="_self">https://www.crops.org/story/2014/feb/wed/researchers-develop-new-breeds-of-crops-tailor-made-for-organic-farms</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(Crop Science Society of America, 05/02/2014)</p>

					<p>SPIRITS (Software for the Processing and Interpretation of Remotely Sensed Image Time Series) was developed by VITO for the Monitoring Agricultural Resources unit (MARS) of the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. The software facilitates the analysis of time series of low and medium resolution remote sensing images. SPIRITS is an integrated and flexible free software environment for analyzing satellite derived image time series in crop and vegetation monitoring. With this toolbox, time series of low and medium resolution sensors such as SPOT-Vegetation and MODIS-Terra/Aqua can be processed and examined. It can be used to perform and to automatize many spatial and temporal processing steps on time series and to extract spatially aggregated statistics. Vegetation indices and their anomalies can be rapidly mapped and statistics can be plotted and interpreted in seasonal graphs to be shared with analysts and decision makers. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://spirits.jrc.ec.europa.eu/?p=273" target="_self">http://spirits.jrc.ec.europa.eu/?p=273</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(EC JRC, 06/11/2013)</p>

					<p>Jane Muthoni, Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI), and colleagues from the University of Nairobi and the Mount Kenya University, carried out an on-farm trial to determine the yields of eight common potato cultivars following storage in diffuse light stores (DLS) for eight months. The trial was carried out for two consecutive seasons. The experiment was carried out in three farmers’ fields while the trial at KARI's Tigoni research station was meant for comparison. Results show that planting of tubers after storage in DLS gave significantly more yields than planting freshly harvested tubers. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Related: <a href="http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jas/article/view/29995" target="_self">Feasibility of Low-Cost Seed Potato Storage in Kenya: The Case of Diffused Light Storage in Nyandarua County</a>. Results of this farm storage trial indicated that DLS could be used by potato growers for prolonged seed storage the following season. This way the growers could be assured of good potato harvests due to the use of well sprouted tubers. This is critical in case of seasons with low or less than average rainfall as experienced in recent years. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jas/article/view/29313" target="_self">http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jas/article/view/29313</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>Journal of Agricultural Science</i>, 01/2014) &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

					<p>Biodegradable agricultural waste blends developed by Greg Holt, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), USA and colleagues at the USDA’s Cotton Production and Processing Research Unit in Texas, are being used by the packaging industry in a new process that 'grows' made-to-order packaging products to protect breakable goods during shipping. The proprietary process involves combining cotton gin waste and fungi inside a cast, resulting in a spongy-looking material similar in appearance to polystyrene foam. The custom-shaped end product provides a cost-effective 'green' alternative to extruded polystyrene foam packaging. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2013/131209.htm" target="_self">http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2013/131209.htm</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(USDA ARS, 09/12/2013) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p><i>Ecology and Society</i> in 2013 included a special feature '<a href="http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/issues/view.php?sf=83" target="_self">Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Global Environmental Change</a>' addressing two main research themes. The first theme concerns the resilience of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and the conditions that might explain its loss or persistence in the face of global change. The second theme relates to new findings regarding the way in which TEK strengthens community resilience to respond to the multiple stressors of global environmental change. Those themes are analyzed using case studies from Africa, Asia, America and Europe. Theoretical insights and empirical findings from these case studies suggest that despite the generalized worldwide trend of TEK erosion, substantial pockets of TEK persist in both developing and developed countries. A common trend on the studies presented here is hybridization, where traditional knowledge, practices, and beliefs are merged with novel forms of knowledge and technologies to create new knowledge systems. The findings also reinforce previous hypotheses pointing at the importance of TEK systems as reservoirs of experiential knowledge that can provide important insights for the design of adaptation and mitigation strategies to cope with global environmental change. Based on the results from papers in this feature, we discuss policy directions that might help to promote maintenance and restoration of living TEK systems as sources of social-ecological resilience.&nbsp;Among the papers in this special feature, one stands out: <a href="http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol18/iss4/art16/" target="_self">Indigenous ways of adaptability to uncertainty: Outputs from an experiment in West African drylands</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol18/iss4/art72/" target="_self">http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol18/iss4/art72/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>Ecology and Society</i>, 12/2013)&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Research led by Sean Tuck of Oxford University's Department of Plant Sciences, looked at data going back thirty years and found that on average, organic farms support 34% more plant, insect and animal species than conventional farms. This effect has remained stable over time and shows no signs of decreasing. For pollinators such as bees, the number of different species was 50% higher on organic farms. It is however important to note that the study only looked at 'species richness', i.e. how many different species, not the total number of organisms. High species richness usually indicates a variety of species with different characteristics. Taking the example of bees, species richness indicates how many different species of bees there are on a farm but not the total number of bees. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://phys.org/news/2014-02-farms-species.html" target="_self">http://phys.org/news/2014-02-farms-species.html</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(Phys.org, 03/02/2014)&nbsp;</p>

					<p>The species <i>Coffea canephora</i>, which produces Robusta coffee, has substantial genetic diversity, which could almost certainly be better exploited in breeding programmes if it were characterized better. A team from CIRAD recently analysed that diversity using microsatellite markers. This was the first truly comprehensive genetic study of the species. It confirmed the existence of diversity groups, analysed the relations between them and determined the genetic structure of the species, particularly the role played by refuge zones during the glacial period of 25,000 years ago and the effect of subsequent human interventions. The analysis covered almost 300 coffee genotypes from the Guineo-Congolese region. The results are crucial for the management and use of genetic resource collections, and should serve the eventual development of adapted coffee crop. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.cirad.fr/en/research-operations/research-results/2014/diversity-of-coffee-trees-in-the-guineo-congolese-region-the-role-of-climatic-refuges-and-domestication" target="_self">http://www.cirad.fr/en/research-operations/research-results/2014/diversity-of-coffee-trees-in-the-guineo-congolese-region-the-role-of-climatic-refuges-and-domestication</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(CIRAD, 15/01/2014)&nbsp;</p>

					<p>In this report, Marian Vittek, Institute for Environment and Sustainability, Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, and colleagues examine land cover changes occurring between 1975 and 1990 in West Africa using a systematic sample of satellite imagery. Results reveal that in 1975 about 6% of West Africa was still covered by dense tree cover complemented with 12% of tree cover mosaic. Almost half of the area was covered by other wooded land and the remaining 32% was represented by other vegetation cover. Over the 1975–1990 period, the net annual change rate of cover was very low (less then -1%). On the other side, other vegetation cover increased annually by 0.70%, most probably due to the expansion of agricultural areas. This study demonstrates the potential of Landsat data for large scale land cover change assessment in West Africa and highlights the importance of consistent and systematic data processing methods with targeted image acquisition procedures for long-term monitoring. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/6/1/658" target="_self">http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/6/1/658</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>Remote Sensing</i>, 07/01/2014)</p>

					<p>Scientists from the universities of Göttingen (Germany) and Lund (Sweden) together with Indonesian partners, carried out laboratory experiments and field trials on cocoa plantations in Indonesia. They found that a species-rich ant community could ensure from 27 to 34 % of the cacao yield. The scientists point out that individual ant species have both positive and negative influences on the cocoa yield, but the positive effects dominate. When cocoa trees are populated by undisturbed, species-rich ant communities, however, the cacao yield is up to 27% higher than when they are barred from the cocoa trees. The findings differ when an ant community is dominated numerically by one single species. For instance, the black cocoa ant native to Indonesia brings similar benefits to those of species-rich ant fauna, nevertheless the invasion of an exotic ant can reduce the harvest by up to 34%. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.rural21.com/english/science-research/detail/article/ants-can-positively-influence-cocoa-yields-0000991/" target="_self">http://www.rural21.com/english/science-research/detail/article/ants-can-positively-influence-cocoa-yields-0000991/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Rural 21</i>, 08/01/2014)</p>

The genome code is a draft, but once it has been polished, could serve as a blueprint for scientists seeking new ways of attacking the voracious insect.

Investigating a cotton-soybean-wheat crop rotation under biodynamic, organic and conventional (with and without <i>Bt</i> cotton), researchers observed a significant yield gap for cotton between farming systems in the first crop cycle which levelled out for wheat and cotton due to lower yields in the conventional systems in the second crop cycle. Gross margins from conventional systems where 30% higher in the first crop cycle, whereas in cycle 2 gross margins in organic farming systems were significantly higher (+25%) due to lower variable production costs but similar yields. Soybean gross margin was significantly higher in the organic system across the four harvest years. Future research needs to elucidate the long-term productivity and profitability, particularly of cotton and wheat, and the ecological impact of the different farming systems. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0081039" target="_self">http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0081039</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>PLOS ONE</i>, 12/2013)</p>

	FIND THE CONTENT OF THE PROCEEDINGS' CD-ROM&nbsp;<a href="http://extension.cta.int" target="_blank">HERE</a>.This CTA publication reflects the state of the art and contemporary thinking and approaches for transforming advisory and extension services and making them more responsive, efficient and effective. It is a major output of the International Conference on 'Innovations in Extension and Advisory Services: Linking Knowledge to Policy and Action for Food and Livelihoods' held in Nairobi in November 2011 which brought together about 500 national, regional and international experts, key stakeholders and organisations. The objective was to take stock of current policies, thinking and practice, successes and failures of ongoing and past reforms in extension and advisory services and build a coalition to address needs of smallholder farmers, in particular marginalised communities, women and youth in a sustainable and cost-effective manner.The published papers were developed from the short-listed abstracts that were selected in response to the call for papers and case-studies and presented during the Conference in 2011. They are presented in keeping with the four thematic areas that were covered: policy, capacity development, tools and approaches and learning networks. These are unique papers that provide insights into the research and practices that are being conducted in the area of extension and advisory services around the world. They also reflect the gaps where more work is needed, especially in the area of policy and impact assessment.The proceedings are a valuable resource for informing policy and practice on extension and advisory services and serves as one of the legacies of the international collaboration that led to this successful conference.Find the content of the proceedings' CD-Rom <a href="http://extension.cta.int" target="_blank">here</a>.Find the event page <a href="/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Selected-events/International-Conference-Innovations-in-Extension-and-Advisory-Services-Linking-Knowledge-to-Policy-and-Action-for-Food-and-Livelihoods" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

					<p>Monkombu Swaminathan, the veteran Indian crop scientist and World Food Prize laureate, wants the UN to devote a year to the world’s ‘orphan crops’ working with agricultural research organisations. Orphan crops are neglected and underutilised plants species (NUS) that can play an important role in contributing to food security either directly by being grown on the farm and commercialised or through their genetic resources, potentially useful in developing improved varieties of conventional crops. Swaminathan argues for an international concerted effort to develop research frameworks and programmes that would explore and exploit the potential of orphan crops in agriculture. Orphan crop are often proven to be adapted to a wide variety of weather patterns, soil conditions and/or pests and pathogen outbreaks. The esteemed scientist also presses the fact that many of the world’s grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables have relatives in the plant kingdom that naturally possess many of the micronutrients lacking in today’s diets. In his opinion, society doesn’t always need to genetically engineer nutritious crops when natural ‘bio-fortified’ plants already exist: his point being that orphan crops offer a viable option for food and nutrition security, as much as GM crops can.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i>Editor’s note</i></b> – Promoting NUS for food and nutrition security is not new.

					<p>Balz Frei, director of the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University, explains in a new review published in the journal <i>Nutrients</i> why most large, clinical trials of vitamin supplements are largely useless in determining the real value of these micronutrients. Frei shows that many projects have tried to study nutrients that are naturally available in the human diet the same way they would study a powerful prescription drug, which he thinks is an inadequate research methodology that produces flawed findings. Needed are new methodologies that accurately measure baseline nutrient levels, provide supplements or dietary changes only to subjects who clearly are inadequate or deficient, and then study the resulting changes in their health. Tests must be done with blood plasma or other measurements to verify that the intervention improved the subjects' micronutrient status along with biomarkers of health.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-12/osu-mcs123013.php" target="_self">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-12/osu-mcs123013.php</a>(EurekAlert, 30/12/2013)</p>

					<p>Currently scientists do not fully understand how shellfish, such as oysters, mussels, scallops and clams produce their shells, or how a change in environment will affect their populations. To address this, the European Union is funding an ambitious science programme called CACHE (Calcium in a Changing Environment). The programme, implemented by a international team of scientists, coordinated from the British Antarctic Survey,&nbsp; will put light on the role of shellfish in the marine ecosystem and will focus on the animals’ capacity to adapt to changing marine conditions.&nbsp; A central aim of the programme is to help young scientists develop their careers through exposure to both research institutions and the business world.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_bas/news/news_story.php?id=2417" target="_self">http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_bas/news/news_story.php?id=2417</a>(NERC BAS, 09/12/2013)</p>

					<p>A team from CIRAD suggests adopting an approach based on analysing the functional traits of service plants in banana-based systems in the West Indies would help farmers choose the most appropriate species and decide at what point in the crop cycle these plants must be used.&nbsp; Service plants offer a range of advantages for agro-systems. They can control weeds, regulate pests and diseases and improve soil structural condition and fertility. The research tested a number of plant combinations in Caribbean banana agro-ecosystems. For instance, plants that do not harbour the nematodes that attack banana plants were identified. If planted during fallow periods, they clean the soil and avoid the need for nematicides after replanting of the crop.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cirad.fr/en/research-operations/research-results/2013/banana-growing-in-the-west-indies-biodiversity-agrosystem-services-and-functional-traits-of-plants" target="_self">http://www.cirad.fr/en/research-operations/research-results/2013/banana-growing-in-the-west-indies-biodiversity-agrosystem-services-and-functional-traits-of-plants</a>(CIRAD, 12/2013)</p>
