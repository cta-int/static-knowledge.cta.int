						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

A review published in the journal Science proposes a comprehensive approach ― the Drylands Developments Paradigm (DDP) – to understand and avoid further desertification. It brings together researchers from several communities to promote a common vision: that dryland management must consider the complex interactions between humans and their environment. The DDP was born of the need to address how dryland communities can recover from the downward spiral of economic and ecological degradation. The framework could bring renewed hope to dryland areas, especially in developing countries, where meeting the needs of local communities places increasing pressure on resources.Source: SciDev.Net, 14 May 2007. </p>

Seed banks are to be used to boost food security in drought-prone Oromia regional state of eastern Ethiopia. ‘Wherever there is food insecurity, there is also seed insecurity,’ Kedir Mummedie, head of the agriculture and rural development department in East Hararghe, Oromia regional state, said. With a Norwegian government donation of US$3.8 million, the project aims to establish sustainable seed security systems to benefit an estimated 30,500 people in Oromia. Kedir said farmers in the area had been organised through four cooperatives in Gursum, Kurfachele and Kersa to be given improved cereal and vegetable seeds in the first phase of the project. ‘After they harvest the improved seed, they sell to local farmers to fill the existing gap in seed supply,’ he said.

					<p> 
African governments are increasingly recognising the importance of innovation in development. But little will be achieved unless government structures are aligned with long-term technological and economic goals. The urgency to do so was recently illustrated by the decision of Malawian President Bingu wa Mutharika to merge the ministries of education with science and technology. But more importantly, he also placed the ministry in the president’s office and appointed himself the minister. With this move, it is expected that educational and technological objectives will be integrated into the rest of the sectors of the economy and not limited to sectoral functions. Building competence in science and innovation policy will require investment in specialised courses and degree programmes on the subject. This could be accomplished by graduate schools of science and innovation policy that can then cooperate with similar programmes in other countries. Every new crop of leaders should attend specially designed leadership training courses before taking office. Dedicated ‘schools of governance’ or their equivalent are needed on a large scale to focus on this important task. But victory will remain elusive unless the efforts are accompanied by deeper institutional reforms that involve aligning economic and technological goals with the structure of government. This task involves spending political capital, a resource that only presidents can allocate.Source: Calestous Juma, Business Daily Africa, 18 May 2007. </p>

Rwanda is a small sub-Saharan African nation that is learning to adjust to global warming and the effects of climate change. Decreasing water levels have contributed to loss of agricultural productivity and an energy crisis due to loss of power generated by hydropower stations. Intermittently, floods have washed away homes and created new breeding grounds of malaria-bearing mosquitoes. In this interview, Patricia Hajabakiga, Minister of State in Charge of Lands and Environment, talks about how Rwanda is adjusting to unpredictable climate patterns, integrated better water resource management, and is working to uphold policies supported by the UN Climate Change Convention and Kyoto protocol. She discusses how Rwanda has forged alliances with other developing countries to protect the global south from the effects of climate change.Source: Development Gateway Special Collection on Global Warming, 18 May 2007. </p>

Mbarara University will hold a pre-CHOGM science and technology symposium aimed at addressing issues of science education in tertiary institutions and using technology to transform communities. The symposium, under the theme ‘science, technology and innovation: Key drivers for socio-economic transformation’, will be held from September 3 to 5. It will aim at influencing policy making processes in investment in science and technology for wealth creation, poverty alleviation and social development. The vice-chancellor, Prof. Frederick Kayanja, said: ‘It is said that Africa is still a sleeping giant. This conference must be part of the awakening process. The ingredients of science, technology and innovation are not only key drivers for socio-economic transformation. They are at the heart of the awakening process of this vast continent.’ The outcome of the symposium, one of a series of local, regional and pan-African meetings on such subjects, will set the tone for the Commonwealth People’s Forum workshop, and the CHOGM theme, ‘Transforming Commonwealth societies to achieve political, economic and human development.’Source: New Vision (Kampala), 21 May 2007. </p>

Researchers working in conjunction with the National Irrigation Board (NIB), which manages the country’s four main irrigation schemes, are finally preparing to hand growers the Nerica variety. The variety helped push Africa’s rice paddy yields to historic highs this year. Dr Raphael Wanjogu, head of research at NIB’s Mwea Irrigation Agricultural Development Centre, said national performance trials are in now progress. The Kenya Plant Health Inspection Services (Kephis) and other institutions are involved in the trials to establish best practices for using the variety in Kenyan agriculture.

Mutharika will also head the ministry of agriculture and food security. The education and science ministries report on administrative and operational issues directly to the president, according to Henry Mbedza, Malawi director of science and technology. Mbedza told SciDev.Net that by merging the two ministries, Mutharika had done the right thing, as education is the foundation to producing much-needed technologies. He added that the merger will assist policy makers in prioritising science in education ‘to produce the much-needed human resource which is currently insufficient in Malawi’.Source: SciDev.Net, 22 May 2007. </p>

This feature article reports on efforts to fight hunger in Africa by preserving seeds and boosting research into improved crop varieties. In the face of impending climate change, many fear that Africa will be hit hardest in its ability to produce food. Success in preventing food shortages in Africa will be achieved only if farmers maintain a wealth of seed diversity that can cope with ever-changing rainfall patterns.
In recognition of this, new initiatives are emerging that will hopefully bring about a green revolution, and ensure food security in Africa. In an era where economies are driven by scientific and technological developments, no single country in African can ignore science and still expect to thrive. The continent of Africa has the basics ― land and water ― to produce enough food for its people. Combined with initiatives to train scientists, develop seeds and improve farmer’s access to this technology ― with support from African policymakers ― the battle against hunger in Africa could be won.Source: Michael Malakata, SciDev.Net, 22 May 2007. </p>

					<p> 
Agricultural economists call it the ethanol effect: an increase in world maize prices based on an increase in the demand for energy, which they say will ensure the future of agriculture in SA. Although the government is incorporating biofuels into its energy and agricultural policies, ethanol distillation from maize feedstock to supply motor fuel has yet to be undertaken on a large scale. Nevertheless, the ethanol effect rescued SA’s maize farmers from a drought disaster this past season, demonstrating how closely local farming is associated with world commodity markets and the energy industry in the US. This year’s mid-season drought damaged much of SA’s maize harvest, particularly in the eastern dryland growing areas, resulting in a downward crop estimate from 11-million tons to about 7,5-million tons. At a break-even price of about R750 a ton, many drought-affected farmers would not have attained the volumes needed to achieve profitability, but maize prices rose sharply this year, touching highs of close to R2000 a ton. Even at low yields, this more than made up for crop losses, crop financiers say, and irrigation farmers made a killing.Source: Business Day (Johannesburg), May 23, 2007. </p>

African leaders should champion the awareness of climate change and the threat it poses to the region among the continent’s population, urged Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai. ‘The threat of rising seas and melting snow all seems very far [away] to people in the continent,’ said the Kenyan conservationist at the UNEP headquarters in Nairobi. ‘Climate change needs to be seriously taken up by African leaders.’ Maathai expressed concerns about Africa’s heightened vulnerability to climate change, citing its close proximity to two of the world’s biggest deserts - the Sahara to the north and the Kalahari to the south – and the extensive clearing of the Congo forest. ‘It is unfortunate that African leaders are interfering with forests. This is not something we can easily trade away,’ said Maathai, marking the International Day for Biological Diversity. ‘We can wish for a good environment, but this will only happen through good leadership.’Source: IRIN News, 23 May 2007. </p>

The Italian government officially announced the establishment of the third component of the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), located in Cape Town, South Africa. There are currently only two ICGEB components in laboratories in Trieste, Italy, and in New Delhi, India. South Africa’s successful bid to host a third component will now see the establishment of the Institute for Infectious Diseases and Molecular Medicine (IIDMM) at the University of Cape Town. The Centre’s research is expected to help scientists across the globe determine the mechanisms relating to infections and the insurgence of diseases at the molecular level. This will boost South Africa’s profile as the preferred destination for global S&amp;T initiatives and will assist in making South Africa a major international biotechnology hub. This provides a unique opportunity for finding further innovative solutions for some of the continent’s most pressing health and agricultural challenges. The benefits accruing to the country as a result of hosting the component range from human capital development; the development of state-of- the art research facilities in the field of biotechnology; to the enhanced facilitation of collaboration with regional and international scientists.Source: Engineering News, 23 May 2007. </p>

					<p> 
A large-scale biogas initiative has been launched to bring renewable energy to 20 million households in some 25 African countries. The initiative was approved at a conference entitled ‘Biogas for Better Life: An African Initiative’, held in Nairobi, Kenya, last week (22nd May). The initiative is being supported by a consortium consisting of African countries (including Benin, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal and South Africa), implementing agencies, local NGOs and donors (including Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the Shell Foundation). Dutch partners in the initiative are the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and development organisations SNV and Hivos. The Dutch partners are currently coordinating the initiative with a small group of African experts. The first national biogas programme – in Rwanda –has already begun. Similar programmes in Ethiopia and Uganda will begin later this year. These national programmes aim to construct the initiative’s first 50,000 biogas plants.Source: Biofuel Review, 31 May 2007. </p>

<h2><a class="listing" style="link" href="/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/Malawi-Technology-to-save-forests" title="Malawi: Technology to save forests" alt="link">Malawi: Technology to save forests</a></h2>

	
					<p> 
Malawi’s utilisation of energy resources is heavily dominated by firewood, which provides 93% of all energy needs. Current annual household consumption of firewood and charcoal are at 7.5 million tonnes, exceeding sustainable supply by 3.7 million tonnes. Poverty and population growth in the country are placing escalating pressures on Malawi’s indigenous forests which, the ministry of environment says, translates into an annual destruction of approximately 50,000 to 70,000 hectares of forest. The UNDP is hopeful that a new ethanol-based innovation will go some way to addressing Malawi’s energy problem. The UNDP has included a local company’s development of an ethanol-based stove in its Growing Sustainable Business Programme (GSB). It will also boost the local renewable fuel industry. The GSB initiative, which grew out of the 2002 UN Global Compact policy dialogue on business and sustainable development, is targeted at engaging the private sector in poverty reduction. The idea is to encourage the private sector to expand employment and livelihood opportunities through the development of new products and services that address the needs of the poor.Source: IPS, 31 May 2007. </p>
