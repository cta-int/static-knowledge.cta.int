						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>For more than a century, scientists have occasionally daydreamed of transforming much of the Sahara desert green, with a lush inland sea or vast tracts of farmland. Now researchers say they have actually found a way to make such a scheme work with forests across the desert and to slow climate change in the process. The idea comes from Leonard Ornstein, a cell biologist at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, who partnered with climate modelers David Rind and Igor Aleinov of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. They envision desalinating seawater from the neighbouring oceans and bringing it inland using aqueducts and pumps. Drip irrigation – plastic tubing to water the trees' roots – would minimize the amount of water lost to evaporation and seepage into sandy soils, allowing trees to prosper in areas that are parched today. According to climate simulations to be published in October 2009 in the journal Climatic Change, the forests would cool the Sahara by up to 8°C in some areas. Eucalyptus grandis and a large number of other tropical tree species are heat-tolerant, so long as they have an ample supply of water in the root zone. The tree cover would also bring more rain – about 700 to 1200 millimetres per year – and clouds which help reflect the sun's rays back into space. (Source: ScienceNOW, 14 September 2009)</p>

	African member countries have taken the historic decision to expand and transform the pan-African Rice Center beyond West Africa. Recognising the strategic importance of rice for Africa and the effective geographic expansion of the Africa Rice Center, the council of ministers last week concluded the 27th Ordinary Session in Lomé, Togo, to officially change the Center's name to &quot;Africa Rice Center (AfricaRice)&quot; (and to no longer refer to it as WARDA). Today the centre is very different from when it was established in 1971 in view of the increase in the number of its member countries from beyond West Africa and the continent-wide adoption of the public goods generated by it.

	Salt-loving algae could be the key to the successful development of biofuels as well as being an efficient means of recycling atmospheric carbon dioxide. The current major limitation of biofuel production is the lack of adequate feedstocks, soybeans and corn, for biodiesel and ethanol production, respectively. Halophytic (salt-loving) micro-algae can be grown on marginal lands with brackish or salt water unsuitable for traditional agriculture. Their growth is non-seasonal, making them 10-30 times more productive than terrestrial crops. They can be grown on municipal wastewater and have widespread potential for recycling carbon dioxide from biomass-, coal-, and gas-fired power plants.

					<p>Angola will begin planting sugar cane for the first time in more than 30 years as the oil-rich country takes its first step toward biofuels. A 30,000 hectare (74,000-acre) site in Malanje province, east of Luanda, is the first biofuel project to get off the ground in Angola where the government is trying to revive farming after decades of war. The scheme is also part of efforts to diversify the economy away from its dependence on oil and diamonds, which have powered a post-war boom since Angola's civil conflict ended in 2002. The leftover fibrous remains from the cane, along with the leaves and waste heat from the sugar processing will be used to produce electricity – around 217 megawatts a year – which will be used locally. Angola is the latest in a line of African countries giving over land to companies for non-food crops, a trend that raises concerns for rural communities at the level of the United Nations.

					<p>A report from the Economics of Climate Adaptation Working Group released in September 2009 indicates that climate risks could cost nations up to 19% of their GDP by 2030, with developing countries most vulnerable. The report concludes, however, that cost effective adaptation measures already exist that can prevent between 40 and 68 percent of the expected economic loss with even higher levels of prevention possible in highly target geographies. The report, titled <i>Shaping Climate-Resilient Development</i>, offers a comprehensive and replicable methodology to determine the risks that climate change imposes on economies. It provides a set of tools for decision makers to adopt a tailored approach for estimating these costs based on local climate conditions, and for building more resilient economies. These tools do not include estimates or measures for emissions reduction, which would need to be examined separately. By determining a location’s total climate risk – calculated by combining existing climate risks, climate change and the value of future economic development – and using a cost-benefit analysis to create a list of location specific measures to adapt to the identified risk, the Working Group was able to evaluate current and potential costs of climate change and how to prevent them. The methodology was tested in localities within eight different countries (China, United States, Guyana, Mali, United Kingdom, Samoa, India, and Tanzania), which together represent a wide range of climate hazards, economic impacts, and development stages. The working group estimated expected economic loss for the eight different case study regions leveraging natural catastrophe risk modeling techniques assuming current GDP growth estimates, under three different climate change scenarios – today’s climate (assuming that there is no additional impact from climate change); moderate climate change (based on the average forecast of climate change for the particular hazard in the location studied); and high climate change (based on the outer range of the climate change considered possible by 2030). The methodology is applicable in any setting where society must consider risk.

They are inviting input from farmers, agricultural scientists, government officials, and non-profit organizations. The goal is to draw attention to the sorts of innovations that may need additional financial or policy support. The findings will be shared with farmer organizations, development agencies, international funders, private foundations and agricultural research institutions, including the CGIAR centers and National Agricultural Research Systems (NARS) centers throughout Africa. Many of these innovations will be featured in the 2011 edition of State of the World, Worldwatch's annual book.

					<p>Questions are being raised about the diversity of new seed varieties touted as the key to unlocking agricultural potential. IIED scientists say seed companies are increasingly influencing what farmers plant, and pushing the traditional varieties to the periphery in the developing countries. The trend would kill seeds that endure drought and pests. They claim that the state of affairs was exposing the poor countries at a time when the effects of climate change were starting to hit hard. The project leader Krystyna Swiderska said areas where the traditional varieties were still in use, farmers were able to cope with the effects of climate change.

					<p>While the world looks for signs that recession may be coming to an end, for the Kamasika Seed Growers Association of Zambia's Western Province, times are good. ‘Just last week we concluded a deal to supply 50 tonnes of maize seed for US$4200 to the Progen Seed Company,’ boasts Association chairman Mulele Mazeko. ‘We have also sold 8.6 tonnes of sorghum seed to a number of different buyers.’ For the first time, farmers in Zambia's poorest region are able to buy top quality seed, grown by local seed producers and certified by the province's new, state-run seed-testing laboratory in Mongu town. It is an extraordinary development in an area normally reliant on food aid. The Kamasika Seed Growers are just one of many groups to benefit from two EU-funded programmes operating in the province. The Right to Seed initiative, implemented by the NGO Self Help Africa, provided the spark for the growers. In 2004, three trainees from a seed multiplication course set up a cooperative to multiply high yielding varieties of maize, sorghum, groundnut and rice.

					<p>Cuba and China have renewed for another five years the Memorandum of Understanding for cooperation in the field of biotechnology, which is a sign of its positive development. During the ceremony held on Monday in Beijing, the two parties, represented by Ricardo Cabrisas, vice-president of the Cuban Council of Ministers, and Zhang Ping, president of China’s National Commission for Development and Reform, expressed their willingness to deepen and expand cooperation in spheres of mutual interest. In a friendly atmosphere, the two leaders agreed on the satisfactory execution of the programs carried out so far in biotechnology, as well as on its importance for the economic and social development of their respective nations. They also said that conditions are created for cooperation to be intensified and taken to the next level. (Source: Caribbean Net News, 8 September 2009)</p>

					<p>The World Climate Conference-3 (WCC-3) convened at the Geneva International Conference Centre in Geneva, Switzerland, from 31 August - 4 September 2009, under the theme “Better climate information for a better future.” The conference was attended by more than 2000 participants, including delegates from 165 countries, comprising seven heads of state and scores of ministers, as well as heads and representatives of international organizations, science and academia, and members of civil society. This report consists of a brief history of the WCC meetings followed by a summary of the conference proceedings. (Source: IISD Reporting Services, 7 September 2009)</p>

	The EU Commissioner for Science and Research Janez Potoènik paid an official visit to the AU and Kenya from 7 to 9 September, during which he held high-level political meetings and visited EU-supported research centres in Nairobi (Kenya) and in Addis-Ababa (Ethiopia). This visit took place in the framework of the Science &amp; Technology Partnership established between the AU and the EU in December 2007. ‘Science is not a luxury for Africa but crucial to finding sustainable solutions to the many challenges Africa faces. The S&amp;T partnership puts EU-AU cooperation on new footing: a true partnership of equals where the EU works not so much for Africa as with Africa. Africans decide their own research priorities and together, we will build a strong research capacity that can encourage and retain local talent and attract foreign scientists’, stated Commissioner Potoènik. He added: ‘The partnership involves the 53 AU member states and the 27 EU member states. I will highlight the need to further coordinate the efforts of these 80 states to ensure that this partnership will make a difference.’ (Source: Afrol News, 7 September 2009)</p>

					<p>As the world's attention increasingly turns to the impact of climate change, at least one project intended to reduce global carbon emissions is accused of displacing indigenous persons from their home in Uganda. Carbon trading is divided into two separate markets: the compliance market - as provided for under the CDM and the EU’s Emission Trading Scheme, mandatory programmes worth 32 billion dollars last year - and the much smaller voluntary carbon offset market. Voluntary carbon offsets involve individuals, companies and even governments to pay for projects to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions. These projects range from wind farms and other renewable energy sources, to efforts to reduce methane released from landfills, to forestry. The voluntary carbon offset market is growing rapidly, but in Uganda, the Forests Absorbing Carbon-dioxide Emissions Foundation (FACE), a Dutch organisation involved in the voluntary carbon market, has generated controversy as indigenous people in the Mount Elgon region have been displaced to clear the way for tree-planting projects.

					<p>‘African farmers will play a major part in the solution of climate change mitigation,’ predicts Dennis Garrity, head of the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF). ‘Deforestation contributes to 20 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Counting the loss of trees on agricultural land this number increases to 34 percent,’ says Global Coordinator of the Alternatives to Slash and Burn Partnership, Peter Minang. For both agroforestry scientists, planting trees on farms on a massive scale will yield more than just timber, fruits and fertiliser. Agroforestry provides an important carbon sink and takes pressure off remaining tropical forests. On 46 percent of the world's farmlands - or 1 billion hectares, harboring 500 million people - tree cover exceeds 10 percent, states a newly-released ICRAF study. Reason to include agroforests in the negotiations over a Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) climate deal at the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP) in Copenhagen this December. ‘Through agroforestry-mitigation, Africa can tap into the $118 billion carbon market and use the proceeds for crucial adaptation efforts,’ agrees Minang. ‘But the continent is divided on what REDD should entail.’ (Source: AllAfrica.com, 5 September 2009)</p>
