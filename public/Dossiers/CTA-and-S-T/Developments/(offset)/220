						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Dr Dlamini-Zuma, Chairperson &nbsp;of the African Union (AU) Commission, delivered a public lecture at the University of Pretoria on the role of research in African universities and how it can bring about development on the African continent. Dr Dlamini-Zuma said research universities, as producers and disseminators of knowledge, were critical to development and to building knowledge economies. She emphasised the need for a skills revolution to train thousands and thousands of professionals in a whole range of different fields such as urban planning, health, education, infrastructure, as well as in agriculture and agroprocessing. She called for more dynamic linkages and cross-fertilisation between industry, businesses, industrial policy and universities. Dr Dlamini-Zuma also called for building research universities in an African context with a concurrent drive to increase the number of PhDs within the continent and spoke on the need to create research centres of excellence across the continent. &nbsp;&nbsp;(University of Pretoria, 30/04/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>At the April 2014 meeting of the Open Agricultural Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology (OFAB) in Nigeria, agricultural biotechnology experts called on governments to invest in and develop laboratory infrastructures across the continent. Professor Baba Yusuf Abubakar, executive secretary of the Agricultural Research Council of Nigeria and Dr Jonathan Mufandaedza, chief executive and registrar of the National Biotechnology Authority of Zimbabwe explained that modern laboratory infrastructures were indispensable to the promotion of research, enabling testing, certification and innovative development of food products. Dr Nompumelelo Obokoh, chief executive of AfricaBio, said the continent must explore ways of mobilising resources to improve laboratory infrastructure and training scientists in agricultural research, such as public-private partnerships. Other experts argued that obstacles to scaling up research laboratory infrastructures included shortage of trained personnel, poor laboratory management systems, and lack of accessible and quality-assured laboratory services to support meaningful research in agriculture. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.herald.co.zw/invest-in-food-security-african-states-urged/" target="_self"><i>The Herald,</i> Zimbabwe</a>, 02/05/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>At a seminar organised by the Interuniversity Institute for Advanced Research on Science and Universities (INAECU), Rafael van Grieken, director of the Spanish National Agency for Evaluation of Quality and Accreditation (ANECA), spoke about the evaluation of research activity at universities. Van Grieken argued that the model of accreditation and evaluation of research at universities is characterised by being overly quantitative and by not sufficiently appreciating aspects such as professional activity and knowledge transfer. 'The model tries to evaluate quality, but ends up being very quantitative because of the regulatory framework, the secondary or indirect nature, the structuring (of knowledge) into large areas and the obligation to express it by points', explained van Grieken, who noted that knowledge transfer is not sufficiently appreciated in some areas while in others it is perhaps valued too much. According to him, there was a need to develop solid qualitative indicators to assess the universities' activities and impact. The purpose of the seminar was 'to help Spanish science improve, be competitive, on the basis of proposals of evaluation and of policies of incentive schemes for research activities'. &nbsp; &nbsp;(<a href="http://portal.uc3m.es/portal/page/portal/actualidad_cientifica/noticias/universities_research_evalu" target="_self">Universidad Carlos III de Madrid</a>, 07/05/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>To help learned societies and other scientific institutions decode the mysteries of the European Union in relation to science policy, Lisa Bungeroth, European Research Policy Officer at the UK Higher Education International Unit (IU), presented a simplified view of the processes behind higher education and innovation policy in the EU. The three bodies that interact to pass EU legislation are: the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the Council of Ministers. Once legislation has been proposed by the Commission, documents bounce back and forth between the Parliament and the Council of Ministers, taking any amendments into account. Bungeroth also highlighted four main policy frameworks relevant to science research in the EU: (i) EU 2020 – a 10 year strategy to make the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world; (ii) Innovation Union – the flagship initiative of EU 2020 to promote innovation in the EU; (iii) European Research Areas – the strategy to create a Europe-wide single market for research, innovation and knowledge; (iv) Horizon 2020 – the main funding programme for research and innovation. &nbsp; &nbsp;(<a href="http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/blog/2014/05/01/decoding-eu-science-policy/" target="_self">British Ecological Society</a>, 01/05/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>On 20 March 2014, the European Parliament rejected the EC’s proposed definition of nanomaterials added to food products. Lawmakers decided that the proposed definition would have exempted foods containing nanomaterial additives that are already on the market from being labelled as such. The parliament argued that allowing the word 'nano' in brackets on the labels would confuse consumers and suggested that these additives are new, which would therefore make them 'erroneous and irrelevant'. In addition, a month ago the Parliament's committee for Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) had stated that the Commission's 50% nano-particles threshold for an ingredient to qualify as 'nano' was much too high. This definition, they argued, disregards the European Food Safety Agency's (EFSA) advice of a 10% threshold in light of ongoing uncertainty regarding the safety of nanomaterials. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.euractiv.com/health/parliament-opposes-commission-na-news-534093" target="_self">EurActiv.com</a>, 12/03/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Emmy Koeleman, editor at AllAboutFeed.com, writes about the production, trade and use of edible insects as food and feed and the wide range of regulatory areas, from product quality assurance to the environmental impact of insect farming, that govern this sector. She argues that no clear legislation with respect to insect-based animal feed exists, raising questions on how the development of novel insect products are affected by the multitude of laws in the EU. She cites the work of the FAO in providing a first look at the regulations on the regulatory frameworks influencing insects as food and feed at international, regional and national levels. Her focus is on the processing aspects of using insects in animal feed, the early experiments and the promising avenues. The need for new protein sources with minimal environmental impacts is urgent and the EU should be pressed to develop an enabling legal framework to govern the sector, she argues. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.allaboutfeed.net/Home/General/2014/5/Legislation-hinders-use-of-in-feed-bugs-1514741W/" target="_self">AllAboutFeed.com</a>, 02/05/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>The popularity of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) is on the rise in many countries for a multitude of applications. In one such development, the UAS is rapidly becoming a tool for crop monitoring and management, which is essential for food security. GeoCuba has been successfully testing UAS technology for farming purposes. A pilot project conducted in Cuba in co-operation with the Russian firm Uniintex-Ginus has shown that a UAS is a flexible, low-cost solution, but it has also revealed some limitations. A UAS offers great flexibility to quickly acquire data in sufficient spatial resolution at low cost. However, the use of UASs is restricted to small areas. Moreover, flexibility has its limits as the use of a UAS for civilian applications is still subject to the same regulations as for manned aircrafts; permission must be requested a few days in advance. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i><a href="http://www.gim-international.com/news/mapping/uas/id8009-uas_in_farming_a_pilot_project_in_cuba.html" target="_self">GIM Intenational</a></i>, 23/04/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>In the study recently published in <i>Nature Communications</i>, researchers from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, US, led by Patricio Grassini, assistant professor in the Department of Agronomy and Horticulture, analysed the trends of crop yields over the past four decades in 36 countries and regions. The study suggests that previous predictions of yield gain have been overly optimistic and that, in fact, yields in some areas have already reached a plateau. However, while yield gains follow a linear upward trend, there are interruptions and changes over time and world regions. For some of the most productive areas around the world, yields have not increased for one or two decades and further steady gains in yield in these regions are unlikely. The researchers noted that such plateaus also occur at very low yields in some developing regions of the world. Citing the example of maize in sub-Saharan Africa, very low yield plateaus are not due to a biophysical limits (unlike wheat in Western Europe or rice in China), but to external obstacles. In these regions, there is more opportunity to increase yields through use of technology and smart public investment (see ACIAR publication above). Grassini and colleagues from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Wageningen University are currently working on a project called the Global Yield Gap Atlas. The project aims to estimate yield potential for cropping systems around the globe and compare potential yields to actual yields in order to estimate yield gaps. Mapping areas where the yield gap is large can help prioritise research and inform agricultural policies. &nbsp;&nbsp;Editor's note: We know that there is a yield gap in some regions and in other regions, countries have reached their optimum yield potential. Will the Global Atlas also tell us what are the existing technological options and financial investments needed for increasing productivity to provide nutritious food at affordable prices while ensuring that smallholder farmers can earn reasonable incomes? &nbsp;(<a href="https://www.crops.org/story/2014/apr/fri/predictions-of-lower-crop-yields-call-for-yield-gap-studies  " target="_self">Crop Science Society of America</a>, 25/04/2014) &nbsp;</p>

					<p>A study published in <i>Global Change Biology</i> by Christoph Müller and colleagues of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), Germany, presents a map of hotspots of climate change impacts in Africa to help guide regional food security interventions. The researchers explored the spread of climate change impact projections and develop a composite impact measure to identify hotspots of climate change impacts, addressing likelihood and strength of impacts. They found that overlapping impacts in different biosphere properties (e.g. flooding, yields) will not only claim additional capacity to respond, but will also narrow the options to respond and develop. However, each hotspot must be evaluated case-by-case, the authors argue, and a continental scenario analysis like this one is not a blueprint for adaptation: only with local expertise can such a tool help to decide where to best put the limited resources allocated to climate adaptation. &nbsp; &nbsp;(<a href="http://www.pik-potsdam.de/news/press-releases/hotspots-of-climate-change-impacts-in-africa-making-sense-of-uncertainties" target="_self">PIK</a>, 06/05/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Working with national partners in Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia, WorldFish, the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and the University of Osnabruck (Germany) have released the results of an analysis of climate change adaptation in food production in the Chinyanja Triangle in southern Africa. The project has identified a number of shifts in agricultural practices in response to climate-related changes. As weather becomes less predictable, local communities have embraced fish farming and small-scale irrigation. In response to reduced rainfall, farmers are increasing water storage and do not drain their ponds for longer periods of time. Communities endowed with a surplus of land have also begun to trade with communities with more water resources. While these changes have helped mitigate some of the effects of climate change, the researchers found that increases in irrigation and aquaculture are straining local water supplies. The project recommends that farmers plant trees along the rivers to increase shade cover, decrease evaporation, and reduce erosion. Other best practices include: distancing crops from the streams' banks to decrease siltation; creating ridges to slow run-off; and planting crops earlier to make use of residual moisture. &nbsp; &nbsp;(<a href="http://land-l.iisd.org/news/worldfish-iwmi-release-research-on-agricultural-water-use-and-adaptation-in-africa/ " target="_self">IISD</a>, 04/2014) &nbsp;</p>

					<p>Soroush Parsa, at International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), Cali, Colombia and an international team of researchers, gathered the opinions of a large and diverse pool of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) professionals and practitioners from 96 countries to understand the low adoption rate of IPM among farmers. Analysis of responses revealed many unique statements on obstacles, the most frequent of which was 'insufficient training and technical support to farmers'. The obstacles were grouped into six themes: research weaknesses, outreach weaknesses, IPM weaknesses, farmer weaknesses, pesticide industry interference, and weak adoption incentives. Respondents from developing countries and high-income countries rated the obstacles differently. As a group, developing-country respondents rated 'IPM requires collective action within a farming community' as their top obstacle to IPM adoption. Developing-country participants appear to worry significantly more about weaknesses inherent within IPM itself. The authors believe the findings highlight the value of improving the active participation and representation of developing-country experience and perception in the IPM adoption debate. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/02/19/1312693111 " target="_self">PNAS</a></i>, 24/02/2014) &nbsp;</p>

					<p>In Europe, the Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive requires EU Member States to develop National Action Plans with objectives, targets and measures to reduce the risks associated with applying pesticides. This study describes a new user guide to identify suitable measures to reduce pesticide pollution at the stream catchment scale. The guide was developed in Germany and it focuses on pesticide contamination via spray drift and surface runoff. Drainage through the soil from agricultural land was not included in the guide. The first step in the guide is to survey and map the catchment landscape for relevant&nbsp; features, including vegetation buffer strips, the type of buffer vegetation, the slope of&nbsp; agricultural fields and 'flow paths' that concentrate runoff, for example, gullies formed by&nbsp; soil erosion or drainage ditches. The next step involves using an 'identification key' to assess the potential for pesticides to enter water bodies, based on information in the landscape survey. The guide gives details of how effective such measures are in reducing exposure, and how feasible and acceptable such measures are likely to be. Users of the guide can compare the different measures to decide which measure or combination of measures to adopt. &nbsp; &nbsp;(<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/370na5.pdf " target="_self">European Commission DG Environment News Alert Service,</a> 01/05/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>The Pesticide Action Network (PAN, Germany) is supporting non-chemical pest management on tropical crops that are commonly grown by small landholder farmers through the project 'Online Information Service for Non-chemical Pest Management in the Tropics' (OISAT). OISAT is a web-based information system to distribute information on non-chemical pest management for small-scale farmers in the tropics and sub-tropics. This field guide provides farmers with practical guidelines and alternatives to eliminate the use and their dependence on synthetic pesticides for the management of cowpea pests. &nbsp; &nbsp;Editor’s note: Clementine L.

					<p>In a paper presented at the 2014 International Conference on Food Security and Nutrition, Francesca V. Hansstein of the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, China, investigates recent findings on consumer knowledge and attitudes towards food traceability across the European Union (EU), China, and North America. A critical review of academic articles published between 2003 and 2013 was performed and a total of sixteen studies were selected. Results indicated that consumers are paying increasing attention to food safety and quality but they are still unfamiliar with the concept of traceability, especially in China. Willingness to pay for food safety differs across countries and segments of population. Age, education, income and food safety concerns are the factors that mostly influence consumer acceptance of traceability and its attributes. Hansstein recommends that both producers and policy makers should work together to increase consumer awareness about the benefits offered by Food Traceability Systems. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://purl.umn.edu/165744 " target="_self">AgEcon Search</a>, 2014) &nbsp;</p>

					<p>The adoption of traceability systems in the food chain is a market differentiator for manufacturing firms. It is appreciated by consumers and is increasingly common after the occurrence of certain problems related to food consumption. Legislation, quality standards and best practices now govern the traceability process. This paper by Monica Sherer and Maria Gomes of UEPG, Brazil, addresses the main regulations that establish procedures for ensuring the safety of food in terms of traceability, and also presents the evolution of information technologies in this area. Although, the latter are still being developed, there are still many opportunities for growth and innovation. As a result, it is possible to see the commonalities between the models of traceability, and also to identify the points of the supply chain of wheat in which the processes are focused. &nbsp;(<i><a href="http://www.academicjournals.org/journal/AJAR/article-abstract/F8B177A44114 " target="_self">African Journal of Agricultural Research</a></i>, 24/04/2014) &nbsp;</p>
