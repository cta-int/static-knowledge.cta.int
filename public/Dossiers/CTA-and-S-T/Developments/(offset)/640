						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>A diversity of approaches grounded on participatory action research have been developed including notably the concept of Integrated Agricultural Research for Development (IAR4D). Despite the conceptual agreement around these approaches and the promise they hold, there are also concerns, not only regarding how these approaches can have impact, but also how they can they do so at scale. Participatory approaches to agricultural research have often been judged to be slow and costly 'boutique solutions' confined to the sites where they work directly. As a result their impact on poverty is considered by some to be marginal when compared with commodity research targeting many millions of people. This link loads a webpage prepared by PAEPARD that list all the presentations given during the GCARD 2 breakout session on 'Innovations for Better Livelihoods', including 'Direct investment by farmer-led research' by Ann Waters-Bayer of the Prolinnova Secretariat, 'Establishing effective livelihood research partnerships for impact at scale' by Patrick Dugan of CGIAR's Aquatic Agricultural Systems research programme, and 'Working with national innovation pilot learning sites and inter-regional innovation platforms' by Wale Adekunle, Director, Partnerships and Strategic Alliances, at the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA).&nbsp;

					<p>In 2012, GFAR and partners launched a new mechanism ‘Gender in Agriculture Partnership 2 (GAP2)’ while continuing to provide support to the Young Professionals Platform for Agricultural Research and Development (YPARD). In Africa for example, there are several programs e.g. the ANAFE-SASACID, FARA UniBRAIN, TEAM Africa, AWARD, and USAID’s Borlaug Fellowships, which aim to build up a cadre of professionals who are sufficiently well-prepared, committed and motivated.More specifically, the expected outcome of the session was to agree on collective action and measures to attract, inspire and empower young people and women for transformative agriculture including AR4D systems and agri-enterprise development. The guiding questions were the following: What are the success factors for empowering youth in ARD? And for empowering women in ARD? How different or similar are these factors? What tools can be used for tracking progress? What programs, projects and networks could be linked to help ensure the greatest degree of learning, and impact? What two to three collective actions should we propose for 2012- 2014? What changes and results do we want to share when we return to GCARD in two years’ time? Through a series of presentations this session detailed a number of answers, in the form of lessons and innovations, for moving the GCARD youth and women agenda forward and, therefore, strengthening the foundations for transformative agriculture. It was chaired by Vicki Wilde, AWARD and facilitated by Judith Francis, CTA.<a href="http://www.egfar.org/documents/gcard2-breakout-session-c22-learning-and-empowerment-youth-and-women-briefing-paper" target="_blank">Click to read the briefing paper.</a></p>

					<p>The GCARD2 has specifically explored the practical implications of partnership and pathways to impact around the themes addressed by the new CGIAR Research Programmes, helping CRP leaders to now reshape their programmes to meet the needs and expectations of partners. This has led to a range of <a href="http://www.cgiar.org/consortium-news/our-punta-del-este-commitments/" target="_blank">new commitments to partnership, capacity development and foresight in the CGIAR</a>, as voiced by Frank Rijsberman, CGIAR Consortium CEO.Through the GCARD2 participants have, among others:


Considered how AR4D systems can align with major development policies being drafted by the G8, G20 and the post-2015 objectives.

Repositioned women farmers’ needs firmly at the centre of AR4D processes.

Directly engaged the voices of youth into consideration of the issues involved.

Developed and agreed collective actions that will bring together diverse foresight analyses, particularly exploring the future for smallholder farming.

Brought a range of innovative agricultural research-for-development agendas to centre stage: household nutrition, gender-based needs, attracting young people into agriculture, meeting the needs of communities shattered by protracted crises, linking farmers to markets, adapting to climate change impacts and fostering community-centred innovation were all addressed as key agendas alongside actions generating productive, sustainable and resilient agricultural production systems.

Set out what is required for solid actions to track and stimulate investments and returns and make these more effective and comprehensive, linking public, private and civil mechanisms.

Agreed practical concerted actions to develop required capacities at national, regional and global levels, providing a launch pad for a wide range of new partnerships and collective actions to deliver change, including the CRPs, the Tropical Agriculture Platform of FAO and partners, the Global Confederation of Higher Education Associations for the Agricultural and Life Sciences, the Gender in Agriculture Partnership and the New Extensionist focus of GFRAS.

					<p>East African Community (EAC) countries have been challenged to invest more resources in science, technology and innovation to enable scientists to carry out research aimed at enhancing economic development. Scientists who met in Kampala during the 3rd Scientific Conference on Development Innovations said if science research and innovations are supported, it will reduce pressure on the Lake Victoria basin. According to Professor Shaukat Abdulrazil, the Executive Secretary of National Council for Science and Technology Kenya, science technology and innovation play vital roles towards economic development for the community. He argues that less support has been provided by the member states despite having many institutions that can carry out research development and innovations.(<a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201210300073.html" target="_blank">AllAfrica</a>, 29/10/2012)</p>

					<p><a href="http://aims.fao.org/community/blogs/digital-repository-development-use-cases" target="_blank">This presentation</a> illustrates the advantages of the employment of AgriDrupal and AgriOceanDSpace for the two repositories: <a href="http://www.kainet.or.ke/" target="_blank">KAINet</a> (Kenya Agricultural Information Network) and the institutional repository of the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (<a href="http://www.kari.org/" target="_blank">KARI</a>). KAINet is a national repository of scientific publications with a focus on agriculture and forestry. It was modelled on WebAGRIS and includes around 35,000 records from which most documents are not openly available. The initial problems with the setup, the service provider server and limited functionalities could be solved by the implementation of secure and manageable tools such as AgriOceanDSpace and AgriDrupal that are available on the AIMS platform. For this reason KAINet was moved to AgriDrupal and the KARI repository was facilitated by the implementation of AgriOceanDSpace. The KAINet team also faced challenges during the implementations, for example, the absence of institutional policies that support open access and the low awareness of copyright issues within the organisation. Another obstacle was the absence of appropriate information management skills. As a preparation for other organisations who want to implement a repository, the speaker underlined the importance of system comparability, technical ICT skills and collaboration within the organisation.</p>

The main ones are: Lack of common and consistently-applied standards, too few specialised professional staff, inadequate technical infrastructure, and too few incentives to curate and share data and knowledge. The key activities that led the consortium to start opening access to its data and knowledge products included the CGIAR Principles on Management of Intellectual Assets, which provided a good legal framework and enabling environment. This policy recognised the CGIAR research outputs (including data and data sets) as international public goods. The Triple-A framework (Availability, Accessibility and Applicability of the CGIAR Research Outputs) provided a strategy of making CGIAR research available widely, with a certain success.(via FAO AIMS, 23/10/2012)</p>

					<p>Talking to <i>Engineering News Online</i>, the South African Minister of Science and Technology, Derek Hanekom, at the Berlin 10 Open Access Conference, in Stellenbosch said that the growth of research in Africa and the ability to find solutions to the continent’s problems will remain limited if African academic libraries continue to have restricted access to official research information. The expense of many academic journals, particularly in science and medicine, limited countries’ access to essential research information. ‘Access barriers sometimes even result in critical, relevant knowledge and research outputs generated in Africa being published in journals overseas, journals that are not affordable to African academic libraries’. He believed that the adoption of open access principles to allow scientific information to be more freely available on the Internet and by removing the financial barriers to accessing scientific information ‘is one of the most progressive ways of growing and showcasing African research’.

					<p>The DRUSSA programme (Development Research Uptake in Sub-Saharan Africa) makes the case for an enhanced role for the communications office in universities, with a focus on this capacity in Sub-Saharan Africa. Author Lynda Cilliers <a href="http://goo.gl/H2ukx" target="_blank">argues</a> for adding activities such as research, research management, extension and community outreach to the mandate of the ‘university communicator’ (the term is used to encompass a broad category of university communication services). Enhanced communication offices are to make sure a university’s research is communicated far and wide to achieve as much research uptake as possible. Effective research uptake relies on research getting to the public via traditional (print and broadcast) and new media (online and mobile channels), publications and events. Communicating the significance of research to the right policymaker (whether at local, provincial, national or regional level), or to targeted NGOs or international agencies, at the right time, in the right manner and style, and with appropriate policy recommendations, can hold profoundly significant implications for African communities (the ultimate beneficiaries are the public).

Pesticides are regulated by legislation that addresses human health, environmental protection, agricultural practices, international trade, border controls and commerce among other topics. In many countries, legal provisions are outdated and incomplete.FAO has published a Legislative Study and Guidelines on Pesticide Legislation to provide governments with up-to-date advice on pesticides management in agriculture and public health.

					<p>Inserting rows of ‘fertilizer trees’ into maize fields can help farmers cope with the impacts of drought and degraded soils, according to a 12-year-long study by researchers at the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF). They conducted three coordinated experiments, starting in 1991 in Malawi and Zambia, and found that farms that mix nitrogen-fixing trees and maize have consistent and relatively high yields year after year. In Malawi, the highest average maize yield was found in fields that combined both fertilizer trees and inorganic fertilizers, but applied at just half the standard recommended amounts.Maize mono-crops grown with inorganic fertilizers may have higher yield in some years but the yield is less reliable in the long run. Mono-cropping without replenishing soil nutrients in any way – the <i>de facto</i> practice of resource-poor maize farmers – was the least productive and most unpredictable of all.EurekAlert has the <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-10/bc-rsl101112.php" target="_blank">report</a> (14/10/2012).<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-10/bc-rsl101112.php" target="_self">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-10/bc-rsl101112.php</a></p>

					<p>The ‘Plantwise’ initiative, led by CAB International and its partners, has updated its website blog with a post on integrated pest management techniques (developed in Colombia) being established in Papua New Guinea to control the coffee berry borer pest (<i>Hypothenemus hampei</i>, a tiny beetle). Coffee berry borer can potentially be successfully managed using an integrated approach with minimal input of broad spectrum insecticides, providing there is some initial investment for added labour costs involved with monitoring and harvesting the crop.The challenge now is to demonstrate to farmers and land managers how the IPM techniques work and to continue improving the techniques. The initial study, conducted in Colombia, which the PNG project follows, produced the paper (open access) ‘Implementing an Integrated Pest Management Program for Coffee Berry Borer in a Specialty Coffee Plantation in Colombia’. The blog post also lists several other relevant links to IPM and coffee.(CABI Plantwise, 6/11/2012)<a href="http://blog.plantwise.org/2012/11/06/bean-and-gone-controlling-the-coffee-berry-borer-using-integrated-pest-management/" target="_self">http://blog.plantwise.org/2012/11/06/bean-and-gone-controlling-the-coffee-berry-borer-using-integrated-pest-management/</a>OA paper: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/IPM11006" target="_self">http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/IPM11006</a></p>

					<p>SciDev.net reports on a recent pilot aquaponics experiment underway in the Cook Islands. The project combines aquaculture (raising aquatic animals like fish in tanks) and hydroponics (cultivating plants in water) in symbiosis, a strategy that can be replicated in other island nations. The project's long-term objective is to give Pacific islanders – who are facing climate-related issues such as drought and fish poisoning – a way to sustainably grow crops using minimal water and no pesticides.This aquaponics project is a great example of successful partnership: it is the brainchild of Pacific Islands Trade and Invest, the business arm of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, which has teamed up with the New Zealand and Cook Islands governments to make it happen.(SciDev.net, 26/10/2012)<a href="http://www.scidev.net/en/agriculture-and-environment/farming-practices/news/cook-islanders-grow-sustainable-food-using-aquaponics-.html" target="_self">http://www.scidev.net/en/agriculture-and-environment/farming-practices/news/cook-islanders-grow-sustainable-food-using-aquaponics-.html</a></p>

					<p>Researchers at Cornell University are working on a long-term solution to ‘super weeds’ – those resistant to the herbicide glyphosate – as these weeds are cutting crop yields and raising costs for farmers, who have to spray more and with different chemicals. Three new glyphosate-resistant (GR) weed species have been documented since January 2012, for an overall total of 24.The agrichemical industry has responded by developing new transgenic crops that are resistant to multiple herbicides. Matthew Ryan, an assistant professor of crop and soil sciences, and Thomas Bjorkman, an associate professor of horticultural sciences, say this response is not a long-term solution. ‘The industry's solution doesn't get at the problem of using a single tactic for weed management. It's not just herbicides. Overusing any one method of weed management, even hand weeding, can create selection pressure on weeds to build resistance’, said Ryan.Instead, the two scientists are promoting integrated weed management (IWM) strategies, which include tactics such as cover cropping, mechanical cultivation, mowing, mulching, crop rotation and targeted herbicide application. Prevention is, however, a tough sell, says Ryan, for those farmers who aren’t currently battling GR weeds.(Cornell Chronicle summarised by Meridian Institute, 22/10/2012)<a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Oct12/CALSWeeds.html" target="_self">http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Oct12/CALSWeeds.html</a></p>
