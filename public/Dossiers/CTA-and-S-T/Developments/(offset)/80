						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>A promising opportunity exists for specific seaweed species based on the analysis of the nutritional value. The study carried out by the Centre for Animal Nutrition, Wageningen UR, The Netherlands, assessed the nutritional value of various seaweed species from different locations in Europe and the influence of a bio refinery process on the value of the residue. Results emphasise the importance of adequate selection of species and the need for further work to be confirm the results based on in vivo digestibility and performance studies. &nbsp;&nbsp;(AllAboutFeed.com, 01/10/2014)</p>

					<p>A sustainable and commercially viable aquaculture production for Atlantic Bluefin Tuna is possible based on results of the EU-funded project TRANSDOTT, which was completed in September 2014. The project built on several previous projects, such as the development of a hormone-based method to make fish reproduce in captivity. It also involved scaling up tuna production and making the endeavour economically viable. Some problems needed to be tackled first: to make the aquaculture more sustainable. Fish-based feed was step-by-step replaced by vegetable feed, to overcome cannibalism and to prevent wall collisions due to poor eye-sight. Some experts believe the best course of action for the Bluefin is to reduce the quotas to let the wild populations increase to some approximation of their original size. &nbsp;&nbsp;(CommNet, 04/07/2014)</p>

					<p>African Yam bean is an orphan highly nutritious crop that is undervalued by policy makers. Plant breeders at the Department of Agricultural Production of Makerere University, are breeding yam beans to develop palatable varieties that are free of poisonous substances and adapted to tall grass savannah agro- ecological zones. 31 new accessions have been included in the CGIAR's Potato Center (CIP) gene bank, and about 60 farmer varieties of yam beans are now maintained at CIP. Makerere University and NARO researchers are optimistic that the yam bean will contribute significantly to food security because it is rich in protein, carbohydrates, zinc and iron and also improves soil fertility. &nbsp;&nbsp;(FarmBizAfrica, 11/10/2014)</p>

					<p>The scientific requirements for degradation and desertification monitoring systems are identified: (i) validation of methodologies in a robust and comparable manner and (ii) detection of degradation at minor intensities and magnitudes. Thomas Higginbottom and Elias Symeonakis of the School of Science and the Environment, Manchester Metropolitan University, UK apply the statistical and ecological frameworks for assessing land degradation and desertification using vegetation index data. They also review the development of multi-temporal analysis as a desertification assessment technique, with a focus on how current practice has been shaped by controversy and dispute.

					<p>Gaps in observational data, uncertainty in projections, impacts and vulnerability, limited capacity to interpret climate information and for making decision under uncertainty, are the key issues identified in this CDKN report. The working paper includes a review of articles and 'grey' literature on knowledge gaps and areas needed to support the capacity of African decision-maker. It also reports on a workshop that brought together UK- and Africa-based experts working on climate science and adaptation in Africa and on a side-event to the Africa Climate Change Conference 2013. Recommendations for addressing the gaps include promoting Africa-led scientific capacity, creating better uptake and translation of existing research, maximising value addition, and improving the science-policy interface. The report is intended to identify key gaps in science and capacity to feed into the scoping phase of the Future Climate For Africa (FCFA) programme, funded by DFID (UK) and DGIS (The Netherlands). &nbsp;&nbsp;(CDKN, 29/04/2014)</p>

					<p>There is clear conceptual overlap and often the inter-changeable use of; resilience, vulnerability and adaptability, which have emerged as the dominant concepts in the study of disturbance and change of social-ecological systems. The authors, Daniel Callo-Concha, of the Centre for Development Research, at the University of Bonn (ZEF), Germany and colleagues, argue that the driving methodological and operational criteria for their application cannot be unambiguously separated. They believe it is difficult to identify guiding principles for the operational application of each and stress that their operationalisation require consistency in approaches and protocols to ensure their coherent use. They conclude that the conceptual and operational integration of resilience, vulnerability and adaptability would perhaps lead to a more complete portrayal of the behaviour of agricultural systems in changing situations. &nbsp;&nbsp;(ZEF, 01/03/2014)</p>

					<p>To better tackle the problem of waste and derive major environmental, social and economic benefits, Effie Papargyropoulou suggests that the actual food waste, as opposed to surplus, should be categorised as either 'avoidable' or 'unavoidable'. This is according to a new framework for reducing wastage throughout the supply chain as published in the UK Journal of Cleaner Production. For developing their framework, Papargyropoulou, of the Technical University of Malaysia, Johar Bahry, Malaysia and colleagues interviewed 23 food experts. They identified reductions of food surplus as the top priority to reduce food waste. To prevent surplus, farmers could produce only enough to meet nutritional and food security needs, retailers could sell only what is required, and consumers could buy only what they really need. Surplus that cannot be prevented should be redistributed to people in food poverty. &nbsp;(EC Environment, 10/10/2014)</p>

					<p>Although pollination has been shown to increase crop quality, impact on shelf life has not been quantitatively studied. Björn Klatt, University of Lund, Sweden and colleagues tested how shelf life, as represented by fruit decay, firmness and weight, changes as a function of pollination limitation in two European, commercially important strawberry varieties. Pollination limitation resulted in lower amounts of deformed fruits. The results suggest that crop pollination has the potential to reduce food loss and waste in pollinated crops and thus to contribute to global food security. Future pollination research should therefore focus not only on yield effects but also on crop quality. A more comprehensive understanding should lead to a more efficient crop production for meeting future food demands. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Agriculture and food security</i>, 2/10/2014)</p>

					<p>Cassava leaves are available throughout the year and should be given as much attention as the roots. They are one of the most valuable parts of the cassava plant containing high amounts of protein, and are also a rich source of vitamins, B1, B2 and C, as well as carotenoids and minerals. In fact, the total amount of essential amino acids in cassava leaf protein is said to be similar to that of a hen’s egg and greater than that of spinach leaf, soybean, oat or rice. Toxicity and antinutrients limit the consumption of cassava leaves as food. These toxic and antinutritional aspects must be addressed properly during processing and before consumption. Research at Hohenheim University is examining the optimal way to treat the cassava leaves in order to transform them into an economical and sustainable source of protein and micro-nutrients. Various cassava leaf processing methods have been developed. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Rural21</i>, 08/09/2014)</p>

					<p>More careful tailoring of seed collections to specific species and situations is critical to preserving plant diversity. Using a novel approach called simulation-based planning to make several new sampling recommendations, this study shows that a uniform approach to seed sampling is ineffective. Publishing in <i>Biological Conservation</i>, researchers from the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis and the University of Tennessee, USA, recommend to collectors to choose their plant populations from a wide area rather than a restricted one. Collecting from about 25 maternal plants per population versus 50 plants appears to capture the vast majority of genetic variation. The approach developed could be used to further refine seed collection guidelines, which could lead to much more efficient and effective collections. &nbsp;&nbsp;(NIMBioS, 30/07/2014)</p>

					<p>Researchers from universities in California, Hawaii and New Hamsphire have analysed contemporary and fossil coral reef ecosystem data sets from two Caribbean locations and from five Indo-Pacific locations. Working together in the working group <i>Tropical Coral Reefs of the Future: Modelling Ecological Outcomes from the Analyses of Current and Historical Trends, </i>they built a trait-based dynamic model to explore ecological performance of coral reef ecosystems in a warmer future. They found a subset of coral species that is fast-growing, phenotypically smaller and wider, and more stress-resistant and that readily produces offspring. Much is still unknown about how this subset functions, but their research reveals a range of nuanced outcomes for tropical reef corals other than near-complete loss of live coral cover in the face of warmer oceans. &nbsp;&nbsp;(UCSB, 01/10/2014)</p>

					<p>Scientists of the EU-funded project Enviguard are developing a real-time monitoring system for offshore aquacultures, to warn fish and shellfish farmers about impending diseases in time. Applied on a moored buoy, the small device undertakes the same functions as a fully equipped laboratory to detect the presence of toxic microalgae, viruses and chemical contaminants. Three different sensors can allow a simultaneous monitoring of the different threats. With this technology fish farmers can prevent epidemics in their aquacultures. &nbsp;&nbsp;(Partnership for African Fisheries, 07/10/2014)</p>
