						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>A study, led by Oxford University scientists, compared the environmental impact of different farming systems. Results of the study show farms that aim for high food production using environmentally-friendly practices could be better for the environment than both organic and conventional farms. The researchers found that ‘integrated’ farms that maximised crop yields whilst using environmentally-friendly techniques – such as crop rotation, organic fertilisers, over winter cover crops, and minimal use of pesticides – would use less energy and generate lower greenhouse gas emissions per unit of production than both organic and conventional farms.

					<p>A research project fostered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's (IUCN ) Commission on Ecosystem Management which involved both conservation and fisheries scientists, aimed at understanding the impsact of fisheries on marine ecosystems. The related paper titled 'Reconsidering the Consequences of Selective Fisheries' concludes that a moderate level of fishing – spread across a wide range of species, stocks and sizes – can achieve high catch levels while conserving biodiversity. In contrast, increasing fishing selectivity to catch a small group of species and sizes neither maximises production nor minimises the ecological effects of fishing. The authors show that heavy selective fishing has caused structural changes to fish communities in the North Sea and elsewhere. By contrast, in several African small-scale inland fisheries, the fish size spectrum – a measure of ecological community structure – has been maintained under intensive and diverse fishing activities that cause high mortality with low selectivity (i.e. diverse catches). Implementing balanced harvesting requires coordinated management at an ecosystem level across all fisheries in a region. Ecosystem modelling could help in determining appropriate patterns of fishing. Markets and the processing sector in some regions would need encouragement to accommodate sizes and species not traditionally utilised.Visit website for more details: <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/03/120315095801.htm" target="_self">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/03/120315095801.htm</a></p>

					<p>The project is entitled PROMISE (‘PROtection of consumers by MIcrobial risk mitigation through SEgregation of expertise’) and will be undertaken by twenty partners from various European countries. The project team comprises representatives of twelve academic institutions and six national authorities for food safety and is headed by the Institute of Milk Hygiene at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria. The PROMISE project has the following goals: 1) make a survey of germs brought in together with food and investigate the potential of bacteria for causing disease; 2) pool data from throughout Europe to enable an accurate assessment of the risks posed by contaminated food of animal origin; 3) build up an extensive database of bacterial isolates identified in the course of the work. The results could help developing countries align their own food safety regulations with standards developed in export markets.

					<p>An international team of scientists has discovered that the effect of fishing for tuna and similar species since the early 1960s has led to a decline in these populations by around 60%. The results have raised red flags, highlighting how several fish species have been overexploited, and particularly how the majority of tuna fish have been exploited to the limits of sustainability. Researchers from Canada, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom have identified how cold water tuna is the species hardest hit by exploitation, with data showing that their numbers have shrunk by 80%. The Atlantic bluefin and the southern bluefin are part of this group, which is known for being big, long living, and of significant economic value. Another species, the mackerel, has also felt the effect in its numbers. Despite being smaller and having shorter lifespans, mackerel are part of a growing and worrisome trend. The study's findings suggest that fishing knows no boundaries: large or small, all species are at risk. The findings suggest that boosting hauls could continue to be a risky act, and that any global fishing effort must be followed with a great deal of care as demand continues to grow.

					<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/news/african-agriculture-dirt-poor-1.10311" target="_self">This news report</a> by <i>Nature</i> explains the importance of fertilizers in keeping Africa’s soils nourished and the action taken by decision-makers. Fertilizers make a profound difference because the rusty red soil, as in many parts of Africa, is deficient in organic matter and in key nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. African governments, international donors and scientists agree that farmers must revitalize their soils, but don’t on the best way to tackle the challenge. Many African governments and agricultural scientists argue that large doses of inorganic fertilizers are the most practical solution. But others are pushing for greener, cheaper solutions, such as no-till farming that conserves soil and 'fertilizer plants' that boost the soil's nitrogen content organically. Researchers report that these latter techniques are beginning to raise yields and improve soil fertility. But farmers are slow to adopt such practices, which require significantly more labour. The report gives an extensive overview of the latest efforts in soil conservation and examines governments and NGOs answers to the problem.

					<p>At the General Assembly of the Association for Strengthening Agricultural Research in Eastern and Central Africa (ASARECA), Executive Director Dr Seyfu Ketema announced the successful production of transgenic maize seeds with a construct of a gene scientifically coded as PNOV-ASARAnxzm35. The gene, also known as the ASARECA gene, was isolated from the maize egg cell. Plants with this genes show more resistance to water deficit. They are capable of returning to full recovery after drying up. Nine maize lines have been successfully transformed by incorporating them with genes that give plants the capacity to resist drought. The research was conducted by scientist in eastern and central Africa and led by Professor Jesse Machuka of Kenyatta University, Kenya. The nine maize lines are being multiplied in a screen house at Kenyatta University in preparation for confined field trials.(<a href="http://www.asareca.org/?q=content/breakthrough-gmo-maize-research-excites-asareca-general-assembly " target="_blank">ASARECA</a>, 18/01/2012)</p>

					<p>Rural farming communities and those whose livelihoods are directly impacted by climate change can benefit greatly from better use of ICTs in alleviating poverty and finding ways to farm sustainably. In this regard, developers and entrepreneurs across the Continent have been working on mobile and computer-based systems which would help tackle climate change in creative ways. This creativity was rewarded by the US Department of State’s Bureau of African Affairs in the <a href="http://www.apps4africa.org/blog/2012/01/14/east-africa-winners-announced-at-villages-in-action-2012/" target="_blank">Apps4Africa Climate Challenge</a>. Announced in January 2012, the first place in the challenge went to ‘The Grainy Bunch’ app, made by 29-year-old Eric Mutta of Tanzania. The Grainy Bunch is a national (Tanzania) grain supply chain management system that monitors the purchase, storage, distribution, and consumption of grain across the entire nation. It was developed with the understanding that selling ‘the effects of efficiency’ to actors in the grain supply chain is much easier than selling ‘the effects of climate change’.<a href="http://www.elearning-africa.com/eLA_Newsportal/youthful-innovation-at-apps4africa/" target="_self">http://www.elearning-africa.com/eLA_Newsportal/youthful-innovation-at-apps4africa/</a></p>

					<p>The European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) published a study mapping the potential of renewable energy sources in Africa. The report analysed the current energy consumption in Africa and assesses potential of renewable energy sources – solar, wind, biomass and hydropower – and their cost efficiency and environmental sustainability. This publication coincided with the official European launch of the UN's year on ‘Sustainable Energy for All’. The map of Africa's solar electricity potential, based-on the JRC's Photovoltaic Geographical Information System (PVGIS), showed that in many parts of Africa the same photovoltaic panel could produce twice the electricity as it would produce in central Europe. However, in order to assess the suitability of solar energy to provide electricity in rural areas, this option has to be assessed against costs for grid extensions and with the traditional diesel generators. A combined analysis of photovoltaic systems, grid extensions and diesel options shows which option is the most cost efficient for each area.

					<p>Farmers in western Kenya experience the dire effects of climate change, through drought and the decline of soil fertility which seriously threaten their livelihoods. A methodology and approach on soil carbon, for sustainable agricultural land management (SALM) practices approved by Verified Carbon Standard and developed by the World Bank for the Smallholder Agriculture Carbon Finance project run by the non-governmental organisation Vi Agroforestry in western Kenya has been recognised internationally. The methodology encourages smallholder farmers in Kenya – and potentially worldwide – to adopt improved farming techniques, boost productivity, increase their resilience to climate change, and earn carbon credits. The pilot, involving more than 60,000 smallholders who are farming 45,000 hectares of land, is run together with smallholder farmers and supported by the World Bank’s BioCarbon Fund.

					<p>The African Development Bank has launched a project to assist in revamping science and technology learning at seven tertiary institutions in Malawi, focusing on increasing access, quality and relevance. The goal of expanding higher education should come as a relief to Malawians. Three universities and four polytechnics, plus vocational training centres, will be the beneficiaries of the Higher Education, Science and Technology project. It will also include technical, entrepreneurial and vocational education and training (TEVET).(<a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20120218071029291 " target="_blank">University World News</a>, 18/02/2012)</p>

					<p>While last month’s climate negotiations in Durban made incremental progress towards helping farmers adapt to climate change and reduce agriculture’s climate footprint, a group of international agriculture experts, led by Sir John Beddington, writing in the January 20 issue of <i>Science</i> magazine (‘What Next for Agriculture After Durban?’), urges scientists to lay the groundwork for more decisive action on global food security in environmental negotiations in 2012. The authors see a need for more ‘integrated research’ focused on sustainable agricultural practices that are appropriate for ‘different regions, farming systems, and landscapes’, particularly in low income countries where climate change is expected to pose the greatest challenge. The goal, the authors said, is to achieve a ‘safe operating space’ where farmers can produce enough food to meet global needs while adapting to various climatic stresses and also minimizing the environmental impact of food production.(<a href="http://ccafs.cgiar.org/news/researchers-outline-food-security-climate-change-road-map-science%20" target="_blank">CCAFS</a> via <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6066/289%20" target="_blank">Science</a>, 19/01/2012) </p>

					<p>Cornell animal science professor Xingen Lei is testing marine algae as a new protein-rich source of feed to supplement and replace some of the corn and soybean meal mix traditionally given to food-producing animals. This could transform a biofuel by-product into a valuable commodity, potentially freeing thousands of acres of crop land. Algae produces 50 times more oil per acre than corn, with a much smaller carbon footprint; uses nutrients more efficiently than land plants, with no runoff; and places no demand on high-quality agricultural land or freshwater supplies. The average pig consumes about 660 pounds of feed by the time it goes to market, Lei said, so replacing just 10 percent of that feed with algae would save a whopping 33 million tons. Lei and his researchers are now working to determine which algae are best, and the proper ratios of algae, soybean and corn. They are also discerning whether there are risks or additional health benefits for humans in resultant products, such as meat and eggs.

					<p>The <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/014/i2454e/i2454e00.pdf" target="_blank">Issue paper</a> is aimed at discussing how the entire food sector, from the farmer’s field to the consumer’s plate, can become more ‘energy-smart’. Implying the requirement of transformation along the food chain involves: <b>(i)</b> relying more on low-carbon energy systems and using energy more efficiently; <b>(ii)</b> strengthening the role of renewable energy within food systems; <b>(iii)</b> providing greater access to modern energy services for development, and at the same time supporting the achievement of national food security and sustainable development goals. The paper provides examples of energy-smart practices for both small-and large-scale enterprises and covers the entire food sector. The approach used to develop this system is based on three pillars <b>(i)</b> providing energy access for all; <b>(ii)</b> improving energy efficiency at all stages of the food supply chain; and <b>(iii)</b> substituting fossil fuels with renewable energy systems in the food sector. The issue paper presents data analysis results for reducing the dependence on fossil fuel in agriculture and serves as support document for designing energy-smart agricultural policies.
