						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	The Copenhagen Conference on Climate Change was no gift to small islands and countries with low lying coastlands. From the Caribbean, Camillo Gonsalves, St Vincent &amp; the Grenadines Ambassador to the United Nations was particularly scathing. He is reported by the Caribbean Media Corporation as saying: “St Vincent and the Grenadines feels no less threatened today than we did when Copenhagen began”. He expressed the hope that the next climate change conference, scheduled for Mexico later this year, will be marked by “openness, inclusivity, transparency and legitimacy.” One Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM) country can claim some success at Copenhagen. Guyana has adopted a strategy of preserving its forests so as to contain greenhouse gas emissions in return for development money. A plan, excluded from the Kyoto Protocol entitled Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) — under which wealthier nations pay rainforest countries for preserving their trees, was specifically mentioned in the political accord.

					<p>Improving ICTs is critical to create an environment for open access. Publishing scientific findings and accessing the research of others is an essential part of the academic process, particularly to encourage debate and foster innovation. But many research institutions in Africa cannot afford to subscribe to many scientific journals, making it hard for scientists to keep up with research. Some institutions cannot even afford to promote and share the results of their research. Only a few people see their results and much of the research findings on the continent are going unnoticed. The open access movement removes barriers to academic literature and offers opportunities to participate in the wider research and teaching community, ensuring that Africa does not end up on the wrong side of the 'digital divide'.

	Scientists have sequenced the genome of maize and cassava, providing vital information that will accelerate the development of new and more productive varieties of these staple crops, and assist breeding programmes to develop varieties specifically adapted to the needs of smallscale farmers in developing countries. Over 32,000 genes in the maize genome have been identified, which will enable scientists to improve yields, increase resistance to disease and enable varieties to better tolerate changes in temperature and rainfall.(Source: New Agriculturalist, January 2010)</p>

	Invasive species have, over the years, wrought havoc on both natural ecosystems and farming systems of the Pacific islands. Early attempts at biocontrol saw some successes, but these were overshadowed by a few spectacular failures: the Indian mongoose, widely imported to control rats, and the cane toad brought in to control cane beetles in the sugar cane fields of Fiji, have now earned their own places in the World Conservation Union's list of the world's 100 worst invasives. But biocontrol is entering a new era in the Pacific region. A more reliable science of biocontrol, and a renewed commitment to networking across the region to share expertise and best practice, mean that biocontrol can now take its place in helping restore equilibrium within the fragile ecosystems of the islands.

					<p>Already under threat from over-fishing, habitat loss and weak management, fisheries and aquaculture are in a poor position to cope with the effects of climate change. Rising sea temperatures are predicted to drive most marine species towards the poles - increasing the populations of warmer-water species and decreasing populations of colder-water species. For example, fish adapted to narrow temperature ranges, such as Atlantic salmon, &quot;may be extirpated from their present habitats because of the combined impacts of warming, changing habitats, introduced competitors and predators and increased parasitism,&quot; the study found.

					<p>In order to feed the increasing world population, further agricultural intensification is required. The world population is expected to grow to approximately 9 billion people by 2050. The potential to expand agricultural land to feed this population, however, is very limited. In order for intensification to be sustainable, agriculture must start using nutrients and energy more efficiently, it must sustain ecosystems and their functions while conserving biodiversity, and it has to be climate-friendly.

	Pro-Vice Chancellors and Deans from Agriculture and allied disciplines of 37 African universities and development partners met in Mombasa, Kenya in September 2009. They addressed priority issues related to reshaping African universities for relevance to societal needs. They concluded that reshaping African universities for relevance will require actions such as re-establishing financial viability; management and leadership; improvements in pre-university teaching; enrolment and curricular development; increasing the output and impact of research; after graduation support and engagement with industry. They committed themselves to responding to the challenges with all the means available to them and called on governments, Africa’s development partners, foundations and private firms and investors to discard the stereotype image of African universities and to be open to new mutually advantageous collaboration (source: proceedings of the meeting)</p>

The website, from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), the UK’s largest funder of agri-food research, is a multimedia resource with numerous social media features and provides an introduction to the food security issue. It includes background information on the food security agenda and facts and figures together with details about the impact of past research, current research activity and the scientific challenges ahead. At the centre of the website is a new multi-author blog – the first on the web dedicated to food security and related research in the UK. It will feature posts from authors across the food security field, including researchers, farmers, industry leaders and consumers. Featuring an easy-to-use, no registration required comments section the blog will be an online destination for comment and provocative debate about different views on food security and different approaches to feeding the growing world population.

					<p>Even as farmers in Africa try to lessen the impact of climate change by growing green fuel crops like Jatropha, the technology required to process these seeds into economically viable products is lacking and debate on how to transfer it from the West is one of the contentious issues at the ongoing Copenhagen climate talks. African delegates say technology transfer from developed countries to developing countries, should be fast tracked. The transfer involves for example helping African countries set up solar panel assembling and manufacturing plants, but the developed countries say this is not possible because of intellectual property rights of that technology need to be protected. A 10-country Africa delegation here in Copenhagen led by South Africa said it would base their argument for unrestricted technology transfer on the fact that developed economies are the major polluters of the environment and that their indiscriminate industrial activities caused the massive carbon emission that resulted in climate change.

					<p>More than 200 companies, NGO’s and governments from all over the world gathered in Jakarta recognizing that business related to biological diversity can be a far more profitable activity than many other economic activities. The conference resulted in two major outputs: the adoption of the Jakarta Charter on Business and Biodiversity while providing useful comments for a Strategy to Advance the 2020 Business and Biodiversity Agenda. These two documents will serve as road-maps up to the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties and the International Year of Biodiversity. (Source: CBD, December 10, 2009)</p>

					<p>Rinderpest, one of the deadliest cattle diseases, is set to become the first animal disease to be eradicated from the planet. The FAO announced November 30th that it expects, along with the World Organisation for Animal Health and other partners, to declare the disease wiped out in the next 18 months. Cattle plague, as rinderpest is also known, has killed millions of cows and other hoofed animals. It is caused by a virus and spreads through contact, and by water and food contaminated with the dung of infected animals. The disease can kill all infected animals in an outbreak, losing farmers money and food. (Source: SciDev.net, December 9, 2009)</p>

					<p>Livestock researchers believe that rather than rid the world of livestock it’s preferable to find ways to farm animals more efficiently, profitably and sustainably, according to a new short film (see article) prepared by the ILRI on livestock and climate change. “Looking at the livestock emissions as a whole, if you aggregate that into one, you are missing a big difference between developing and developed countries,” says ILRI director general Carlos Sere in the film. “In developed economies, which mainly have a commercial livestock sector, we can apply a range of policies and instruments to reduce emissions. Reducing livestock-related greenhouse gas emissions in poor countries is possible, but we need to be aware of the stark trade-offs. We might end up with many more poor people and hungry children.”(Source: CGIAR, December 9, 2009)</p>
