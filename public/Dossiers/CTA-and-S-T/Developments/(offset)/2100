						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p> As global warming pushes temperatures up and droughts become more intense, the production of maize, southern Africa's staple food, could drop by as much as 30% in another two decades, according to a new study. Researchers at Stanford University call on countries to opt for long-term measures like the development of new crop varieties and investment in irrigation, which could help lessen the impact on food production more substantially than shifting planting dates. ‘Adaptation is a key factor that will shape the future severity of climate change impacts on food production,’ said David Lobell, the lead author of the report on the study. ‘These adaptations will require substantial investments by farmers, governments, scientists and development organisations, all of whom face many other demands on their resources.’ A recent survey by Action Aid, a global anti-poverty agency based in South Africa, found that changes in rainfall patterns have affected the growing seasons and the type of crops planted in Malawi: long-season local maize varieties, which take longer to grow, are no longer a preferred option, and maize normally planted in November is now being planted in December.

					<p> Uganda has the best chance to take the lead in agricultural biotechnology developments, says Dr Tilahun Zeweldu, Eastern Africa Coordinator of the Agricultural Biotechnology Support Project (ABSP) II, stressed that the country is in a position to develop its own transgenic crops. Top priority is the East Africa highland banana which is being done in collaboration with ABSP II, National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO)/National Banana Research Program, Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, Leeds University in the UK and Cornell University in the USA, with funding from USAID Uganda. At the moment, Uganda is testing transgenic banana resistant to black sigatoka disease purely as a proof of concept. Transgenic cotton will also be tested, focusing on herbicide tolerance and bollworm resistance. ABSP II is strengthening a laboratory and has provided support to construct a level II biosafety greenhouse at Kawanda Agricultural Research Institute. Although agricultural biotechnology development is going well in Uganda, commercialization of biotech products is not possible because Uganda does not have appropriate laws in place.

					<p> A decision-support tool developed by FAO will help ensure that countries can enter the rapidly growing field of bioenergy production to produce benefits for the poor without jeopardizing their food security. The tool, an ‘analytical framework’ designed by a team of economists from FAO, Utrecht University’s Copernicus Institute and Darmstadt’s Oeko-Institut, was unveiled at a two-day experts’ meeting of FAO’s Bioenergy and Food Security (BEFS) project, which aims to ensure that bioenergy does not impair global food security. The analytical framework allows governments interested in entering the bioenergy sector to calculate the effect of their policy decisions on the food security of their populations and makes it possible, through five steps, to assess: technical biomass potential; biomass production costs; the economic bioenergy potential; macro-economic consequences; national and household-level impact and consequences on food security.

					<p> Almost all biofuels used today create more greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fuels if the full emissions costs of producing these fuels are taken into account, according to two new studies published in the journal Science. These studies are the first to conduct a detailed, comprehensive analysis of the emissions effects of the huge amount of natural land that is being converted to cropland globally, to support biofuels development. Rainforest and even scrubland absorbs far more carbon dioxide than the cropland that replaces it. Taken globally, the studies found that the production of almost all biofuels resulted, directly or indirectly, in new lands being cleared, either for food or fuel. ‘When you take this into account, most of the biofuel that people are using or planning to use would probably increase greenhouse gasses substantially,’ said Timothy Searchinger, lead author of one of the studies. ‘Previously there's been an accounting error: land use change has been left out of prior analysis,’ Searchinger said. The clearance of grassland releases 93 times the amount of greenhouse gas that would be saved by the fuel made annually on that land, said Joseph Fargione, lead author of the second paper. Biofuels were originally thought to be better than fossil fuels because the carbon released when they were burned was balanced by the carbon absorbed when the plants grew. But even that equation proved ‘overly simplistic’ because the process of turning plants into fuels causes its own emissions, for refining and transport, for example.

The funding will be spent on research into the impacts of climate change on the poorest and most vulnerable people, and on helping their communities, governments and the private sector take action to help prepare for these impacts. DFID also announced it will work with interested parties to establish a climate change centre. The centre will form a network of expertise deploying the best climate change researchers, practitioners and institutions to help developing countries understand and work with the physical, social and economic impacts of climate change. This increase on DFID’s spending compared to £10 million over the last five years will help improve scientific, economic and social understanding and provide the best expertise to developing countries to help them plan their response.

					<p> Twenty-one boxes filled with 7,000 unique seed samples from more than 36 African nations were shipped to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, a facility being built on a remote island in the Arctic Circle as a repository of last resort for humanity's agricultural heritage. The vault is being built by the Norwegian government as a service to the global community, and a Rome-based international NGO, the Global Crop Diversity Trust, will fund its operation. The vault will open on 26 February 2008. The shipment, which was sent by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), based in Ibadan, Nigeria, consists of thousands of duplicates of unique varieties of domesticated and wild cowpea, maize, soybean, and Bambara groundnut. The vault has been constructed in a mountain deep inside the Arctic permafrost. ‘IITA's genebank houses the world's largest collection of cowpea, with over 15,000 unique varieties from 88 countries around the world,’ said Dr Dominique Dumet, genebank manager at IITA. ‘Our collection holds in-trust about 70% of cowpea landraces from Africa. Cowpea is a key staple in Africa, offering an inexpensive source of protein.’ Other CGIAR centers have began packing and shipping duplicate collections from Benin, Colombia, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, and Syria. Collectively, the CGIAR centers maintain 600,000 plant varieties in crop gene banks, which are widely viewed as the foundation of global efforts to conserve agricultural biodiversity.

					<p> Monsato and Syngenta have apparently pulled out of an ambitious, Sh70 million (US$10-million) agricultural project because it does not emphasise or recognise the significant contribution of modern biotechnology in agricultural development and poverty reduction. The four-year project – the International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) – aims to do for hunger and poverty what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has done for another global challenge. The scale of the ambition is clear both in the project's promised outcome, as well as in its internal workings. When published later this year, its reports promise to map how science, technology and accumulated good-farming practice can be used to reduce hunger and improve quality of life for rural people in developing countries, according to the January issue of Nature. The editorial – Deserting the hungry? – explains that the writing and review teams (some 4,000 experts in all) comprise a grand coalition including scientists, government officials, representatives from seven UN agencies, farmers' groups, a rainbow of NGOs and industry, including chemicals manufacturer BASF and agri-biotech giants Monsanto and Syngenta.But these last two, part of the assessment from the beginning, have now decided to quit. No public statements have been offered, but the spokesman for CropLife told Nature that the decision was prompted by the inability of its members to get industry perspectives reflected in the draft reports. One of these is the view that biotechnology is key to reducing poverty and hunger, and it is based in part on high (and rising) levels of demand for biotech crops from farmers across the developing world.

					<p> Many working in agricultural research and development would agree absolutely with the statements, issued in the 2008 World Development Report, that the rural and agricultural sectors have suffered from underinvestment and neglect during the past two decades. But, if renewed donor interest and greater funding are to be directed towards agricultural development, how can they be put to greatest effect? A wide range of researchers, practitioners, private sector and farmer representatives, and those from international and donor organisations met in December at the Institute of Development Studies (IDS), UK, to reflect, review and propose ideas to improve research and development in agriculture. Many of those present had been part of the 'Farmer First' and 'Beyond Farmer First' movements of the past two decades and have been involved in various forms of participatory farmer research. But there was a general consensus that farmers and farming systems are changing and that there is an urgent need for changes in approach if more effective agricultural development is to be achieved. A selection of viewpoints from some of those present at the workshop is presented in this Points of View. Source: Points of View, New Agriculturist, January 2008.</p>

					<p> Farmers in Rwanda are starting to sell to premium coffee buyers such as Starbucks and Peet's for the first time, thanks to a program to help them boost the quality of beans. The effort to help African coffee growers is part of a pledge of $900 million from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to help improve agriculture in the poorest countries. Much of the Gates Foundation money will go toward helping small-scale farmers gain access to markets. Partnerships among businesses, governments and nonprofits can ‘stretch the reach of market forces’ to connect producers in developing countries to new customers, helping more of the world's poor earn a living and even increase profits. ‘If we are serious about ending extreme hunger and poverty around the world, we must be serious about transforming agriculture for small farmers — most of whom are women,’ he said in a statement. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation on January 25 unveiled a package of new grants worth more than $300 million, nearly doubling its spending on agriculture. It plans to commit an additional $300 million by the end of the year. Rwanda, Tanzania and Kenya have the right climate and geography for growing premium coffee. With a $47 million Gates grant, TechnoServe is installing new wet mills and training farmers how to produce high-quality beans for the premium market, which commands a 30% higher price. It expects to help 182,000 farmers in East Africa double their incomes in four years. Already the program, which started in 2004, is seeing dramatic results, including an increase in secondary-school enrollment from 20% to 75% in parts of Tanzania, a Technoserve official said.

					<p> The African Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF) has made a grant of US$800,000 to Africa University for the implementation of a Project of Lectures and Workshops in Peace, Leadership and Development in Africa by Eminent Persons, dubbed ‘PEARL.’ The PEARL project is expected to create a forum for analysis and debate on topical issues as they relate to peace building, conflict management, leadership development and socio-economic transformation in Africa. It is aimed at tapping into and utilizing the knowledge of African eminent persons, such as former heads of state, in providing quality academic and professional training and research. The project will be housed in the Institute of Peace, Leadership and Governance (IPLG) at the Africa University and will have a four-year life span. Dr Soumana Sako of ACBF said that as African peoples, we need to design our own workshops, and document our own knowledge as we share experiences with our former leaders. Lare Sisay, UNDP’s deputy resident coordinator, agreed that Africans need to use their own indigenous knowledge and experience, instead of relying so heavily on external sources for knowledge and expertise. ‘There is a wealth of experience, knowledge and best practice indigenous to Africa scattered across the continent with certain eminent persons and we need to put that knowledge into a collective pool for posterity,’ said Sisay.

					<p> Determined to revive the grossly depleted soils of sub-Saharan Africa, which are a major underlying cause of poverty and hunger, the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) today announced a US$180 million five-year program to restore the fertility of Africa's soils. ‘AGRA's Soil Health Program will breathe new life into soils where rapid nutrient loss is sapping the ability of farmlands to sustain crops,’ said Dr. Namanga Ngongi, president of AGRA. ‘This will improve the sustainability of small-scale farms, raise the yield and income of poor farmers, most of whom are women, and help protect the natural resource base of soil and water.’ The program aims to work with 4.1 million farmers and regenerate 6.3 million hectares of farm land through a balanced approach to improved soil management. Initial funding for the Program comes from a US$164.5 million grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and US$15 million from the Rockefeller Foundation. ‘African governments are leading the way on efforts to solve the major food challenges facing the continent,’ Ngongi said. ‘Their plan, the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP), sets out a bold target for achieving 6% annual growth rates in agriculture. Addressing the serious soil fertility problems facing African farmers is critical to obtaining this goal.’ Improving soil health also is a fundamental element of AGRA's commitment to help millions of small-scale farmers and their families overcome poverty by working across the agricultural value chain to boost farm yield and incomes. The Soil Health Program is one part of a comprehensive approach that addresses issues from seeds and water to markets, agricultural education, and policy. In particular, soil regeneration will complement AGRA's Seeds Program and help small-scale farmers make full use of new high-yielding varieties of Africa's staple food crops.

					<p> Africa is a continent in rapid flux. The systems that served it in the pre-colonization era still have deep roots. Although the old systems are wanting in serving the needs of a new era, many of the new systems imposed in the advent of the colonial era have not served the continent well. One of Africa’s greatest challenges is therefore to find compromises between the old and the new that work for it. The Africa of today is a sometimes awkward mix of the old/new and the imported/ indigenous. Africa ought to ask awkward questions and unravel the inconsistencies which the promoters of various ideas about the continent’s agriculture might be quite happy to sweep under the carpet. Not being critically analytical has made the continent the testing ground for all sorts of schemes that have not improved the continent’s fortunes. Being critical is not necessarily rejecting anything. It is merely trying to make the most informed choice of compromises, with the best prospects of achieving the desired goals. The challenge for Africa is to find successful ways to mix old and new, traditional and modern, imported and indigenous. The continent also ought to be realistic about the urgently needed compromises that are unavoidable. Many of the good ideas being thrown about are compromised by the rigidity with which their promoters present them. Source: African Executive, January 2008.</p>

					<p> Largely away from public notice, a battle is raging in Africa over the best ways to raise the continent’s low agricultural productivity, and assure widespread and long term food security. Despite what is generally agreed to be its great agricultural potential, Africa has for long depended on food imports and particularly during times of natural or man-made crisis. One might think any efforts to boost Africa’s agricultural productivity would be welcomed. Yet that is not the case because of the conflict between the promoters of two fundamentally different approaches to agriculture. On one side there are those who urge the widespread adoption of ‘green revolution’ methodologies, such as those that accounted for dramatic increases in agricultural productivity in Asia and Latin America in the 1960s and 1970s. On the other side are those who are bitterly opposed to the whole green technology ethos. They advocate more nature-based approaches to issues of soil fertility and pest management. Promoters of this approach believe that a green revolution approach is not only inappropriate for Africa, but has the potential to do more harm than good. The differences between promoters of the two approaches have raged for a long time, and not just in Africa. The debate has gone up in pitch in recent years as the issue of Africa’s agriculture receives more high-profile global attention. This long-running ideological conflict is not going to go away and is likely to become more heated. It is not a zero-sum game in which either side can expect to out-argue the other, although which side gets the upper hand depends a lot on their respective lobbying abilities. I will be tackling various aspects of this agro-ideological conflict from time to time, with a particular emphasis on the implications on African agricultural policy making and development.

					<p> The European Commission is set to reconsider its draft legislation on biofuels following concerns raised by green groups over their environmental impact. Whilst EU leaders had agreed that 10% of Europe's transport fuels should come from biofuels by 2020, recent reports warned that this policy could have negative consequences such as raising food prices and rainforest destruction. On 23 January the European Commission will publish its legislation on the production of biofuels, aimed at promoting the use of this alternatives energy source. (Source: Cordis 14 January 2008)</p>

					<p> Two major industrial members of the assessment coalition Monsanto &amp; Syngenta (member corporations of the agriculture-industry body CropLife International) have withdrawn from the International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) project. According to the spokesman for CropLife this decision was prompted by &quot;the inability of its members to get industry perspectives reflected in the draft reports&quot;. The credibility of an important scientific assessment is under threat. Monsanto and Syngenta must join the meetings again before the final report is to appear in April 2008.

					<p> Africa's largest oil producer and OPEC member Nigeria is becoming increasingly interested in biofuels to meet its growing demand for fuels and to provide employment to its largely rural population. Contrary to the oil sector, which has caused civil conflict, perpetuates poverty, corruption, and deep social inequalities, thrives on foreign capital and has destroyed entire ecosystems in the country, the development of a local biofuels industry presents an opportunity for a brighter development path. Nigeria has an abundance of natural resources to produce green fuels efficiently, sustainably and in a cost-effective way. Especially the starch-rich tuber crop cassava, of which Nigeria grows more than any other country, is seen as having a major potential for the production of first-generation ethanol, cellulosic biofuels and bioproducts like renewable plastics. According to the secretary of the Nigeria Cassava Growers Association (NCGA), Isaac Sunday Ojonugwa, cassava-based ethanol could save Nigeria up to $6.1 billion by 2012 by replacing imports of kerosene and gasoline. He added that the development of a cassava-driven bioeconomy would be a significant bonus for the nation, as the vast majority of its rural population can participate in the industry. Earlier estimates and announcements on the different industrial cassava plans that exist for the country put the number of new potential jobs at one to three million.

					<p> German carmaker Daimler AG has teamed up with Archer Daniels Midland and Bayer CropScience to explore tropical plant Jatropha as a biodiesel fuel. ‘Biodiesel derived from Jatropha nut kernels has properties similar to those of biofuels obtained from oilseed rapes. It is also characterised by a positive CO2 balance and can thus contribute to protecting the climate,’ the companies said in a statement. The partners aim to develop production and quality standards for Jatropha-based biofuel. ADM runs several biodiesel refineries worldwide, while Bayer plans to develop herbicides, insecticides and fungicides from Jatropha plants. Daimler has already completed a five-year project which demonstrated that Jatropha can be used to make biodiesel. It will continue to explore the interactions between the fuel and engines. Jatropha, a wild plant, has never been professionally cultivated, suggesting the plant could be grown on 30 million hectares of land, especially in South America, Africa and Asia. ‘Since Jatropha can be cultivated on barren land, it does not compete for land that is being used for food production, and thus provides farmers with an additional source of income,’ it added.

					<p> Punch, 3 January 2008. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has earmarked $400 million to boost maize production in Africa, according to Professor Ado Gark, director of the Institute of Agricultural Research at Nigeria's Ahmadu Bello University. The initiative, Garki added, was also aimed at capacity building, training of African farmers and extension workers in the production of drought tolerant maize. He said the institute and the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) would participate in the project, which aims to increase maize production by smallholder farmers by between 20 and 30%. He promised that the institute would collaborate with national and international organisations to provide improved maize varieties to farmers in Nigeria. (Source: Punch, 3 January 2008.)</p>
