						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>There may still be significant questions over issues such as land use and competition for feedstock supplies for traditional food and feed uses, but that will not stop the global use of biofuels from more than doubling between 2009 and 2015. That is the verdict of a new global analysis released by Hart Energy Publishing’s Global Biofuels Centre which concludes that the US will see a growth of total biofuel use by more than 35 per cent; while Brazil will increase domestic supplies by 30 per cent and more than double the production of palm oil biodiesel. Major contributors to the growth of biofuels are expected to include Indonesia, France, China, Thailand, India, Columbia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Argentina; while Germany is expected to remain the largest producer of biofuels in Europe. The prediction suggests that first generation ethanol, palm oil biodiesel and rapeseed biodiesel will be the dominant biofuels produced and, out of approximately 170 next-generation biofuel projects around the world, only 30 per cent are expected to be operating during the study timeframe.

					<p>As the world wrestles with how to cut greenhouse gas emissions, new technologies are gearing up to grab climate-warming carbon right out of the air. This is different from trapping carbon dioxide as it comes out of pollution sources like factories and power plants. This so-called air capture technology could be set up anywhere and suck carbon directly from the atmosphere. The devices to do this are varied in appearance. Some look a bit like telescopes, others involve vast, thin wall-like structures to capture the carbon. But all aim for a net reduction in atmospheric carbon, instead of just slowing down the increase of greenhouse emissions. Because air capture need not be near carbon-belching factories, it could help the world's poorest countries, which at this point cannot benefit from the global carbon market, in which companies in developed countries get credits for investing in carbon-limiting projects in poor countries.

					<p>Protecting Jamaica's coastline from a possible one metre rise in the sea level, could cost some US$426 million, or approximately 9% of Jamaica's GDP. This was disclosed by director of the Coastal Zone Management Branch at the National Environment and Planning Agency (NEPA). NEPA is working assiduously to mitigate the effects of sea level rise, as continuous rise in sea levels will compound beach erosion and permanently inundate areas along Jamaica's coast. Jamaica is already paying for the effects of climate change. This is amplified by its vulnerability to natural hazards, such as hurricanes and floods. A recent vulnerability assessment of Jamaica's beaches, by NEPA, showed that 95% of the beaches are vulnerable to natural hazards. In a storm, high wave energy often results in severe erosion of the beach and/or shoreline. (Source: Caribbean net news, 30 September 2009)</p>

					<p>Cash-strapped Caribbean countries are seeking energy independence through bioenergy development but are hamstrung by poor organization and limited initiatives. UNDP sources said recent biofuel advances in the Small Island Developing States promised a greater reliance on regional resources - &quot;south-south cooperation&quot; - to cut dependence on imported fuel and food. But the targets for self-sufficiency were far from being reached because of lack of expertise, cash resources and access to new technologies, reports on recent studies and surveys indicated. Caribbean states are looking to build capacity for biofuels produced from organic waste. Technologies now exist to convert plants, garden waste and manure into charcoal, biodiesel, ethanol or gaseous fuels but are not yet available to the Caribbean states. The region is also looking more actively into wind, solar, geothermal and hydropower power. The overarching aim is to build cooperation between the countries of the region so they can make use of sustainable energy services and enhance their energy security.

					<p>With the global population set to exceed 9 billion by 2050 and limited natural resources, food production needs to double if we are to provide food security. Innovation in agriculture will be central to finding ways to help farmers grow more food on less land. Crop protection products already help farmers to increase their yields per hectare and innovation in this area promises to further increase their efficacy. However, plant science companies invest significant amounts in many years of research to develop these products and without intellectual property protection, the incentive to invest in such innovation is severely diminished. Protection of safety and efficacy data along with data confidentiality is a key tool to foster this innovation. Javier Fernandez of CropLife Latin America explains the importance of protection of regulatory data and its relevance to the bid for food security.

					<p>The promise of green gold is fading from <i>Jatropha curcas</i>, a shrub that thrives in arid conditions and whose seeds yield a diesel-like oil. Many had seen it as a potential saviour for marginal lands, a plant that could lift developing countries out of poverty and into a sustainable oily future. Just last year, some analysts predicted that the area planted with jatropha worldwide — at the time, 721,000 hectares — would rise as high as 22 million hectares by 2014. But, out of 140 investments made in biofuels so far this year, says an analyst of London-based New Energy Finance, only four or five have been in jatropha projects. Early investors are now realizing the plant's limitations. Jatropha can live in very dry conditions, but does not necessarily yield a lot of seeds. The plant takes three years or more to reach maturity, requiring care along the way, and jatropha seedlings are often not well-suited to the climate in which they are planted. Although jatropha may not be a saviour plant, it is likely to find its niche as a local alternative in certain developing countries. (Source: Nature, 16 September 2009)</p>

					<p>The Refugee Studies Centre organised a workshop on environmental change and migration on 8 and 9 January of 2009. Many recent reports on the likely impact of climate change have highlighted the potential for large-scale “environmentally-induced” migrations in developing regions of the world over the next twenty to fifty years. Environmental transformations resulting from increases in global atmospheric temperatures have prompted many experts to predict the collapse of traditional livelihoods systems, increased conflict over natural resources, regional “water wars”, and a resulting population of “environmental refugees” that some have predicted will be hundreds of millions strong. As yet, there is little concrete evidence to justify such predictions. There is a significant lacuna in both conceptual and empirical research on the relationship between environmental change and the patterns and process of migration. For example, it remains unclear how one can differentiate between “environmentally-induced displacement” and other forms of displacement, given the complex mix of factors which underlie people’s decisions to move. This workshop sought to address this lacuna by bringing together academics, activists, policy makers and development practitioners to share research, experience and analysis on the subject.

	Researchers have linked poverty in sub-Saharan Africa with poor soil health, but two new Cornell studies find that the recommended practice of applying more fertilizer may not help the poorest farmers. Two new studies by Chris Barrett, Professor of Applied Economics and Management at Cornell, and Paswel Marenya, Ph.D. '08, a lecturer at the University of Nairobi, find flaws in the fertilizer-promotion strategy used by dozens of African countries to improve soil health, crop yields and the wealth of poor farmers. Forty African heads of state had devised plans in 2006 to help farmers in sub-Saharan Africa -- one of the poorest regions of the world where soils are often too degraded to reliably grow crops -- get better access to soil-enhancing fertilizers by improving roads, increasing access to seasonal credit and improving farmer education on fertilizer use.

					<p>Small island states that could face devastating storms and floods from climate change urged that global temperature increases be sharply curtailed from goals set recently by industrialized countries.

					<p>Growing demand for products like timber and biofuels is putting pressure on shrinking rainforests. Large-scale tree planting on agricultural land can save those primary forests, agroforestry experts argue. But the new plantations are detrimental to biodiversity and indigenous people, critics respond. Professor P K Nair, director of the Centre of Subtropical Agroforestry at the University of Florida, believes planting trees on farmland is the way to conserve what's left of the world's rainforests. &quot;What is lost now is lost forever. It's an illusion to think you can recreate a rainforest that took thousands of years to develop,&quot; he says. Nair and his colleagues at the Second World Agroforestry Congress held in Nairobi in August argue that an added advantage of tree-farming is that it constitutes a significant potential carbon sink. For African countries - heavily burdened by deforestation and struggling with adaptation to climate change - this could strengthen their demand for the inclusion of agroforestry in a deal on reduction of emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) in Copenhagen later this year.

					<p>Against the backdrop of the mounting food insecurity, as a result of the drought ravaging eastern, central and southern Africa, scientists are urging farmers to cultivate, and the people, to incorporate the soybean into their local diets to improve nutrition, generate income for themselves, and also to improve soil fertility. The soybean has the potential to not only meet the nutritional needs of the people, but also put some much needed money in the pockets of farmers and substantially transform their lives. It contains 40 per cent protein, a level much higher than in any other food crop or even livestock. It is made up of 20 per cent oil, and contains all the eight essential amino acids, making it the healthiest legume crop. Unfortunately, the crop’s rich potential is not well exploited in sub-Saharan Africa, where it is mostly seen as a cash crop. (Source: Africa Awake, 18 September 2009)</p>

					<p>West African experts and officials adopted a common position on the effects of climate change and human rights ahead of the global UN conference in Copenhagen. Participants at a two-meeting in Lome came up with a declaration on the challenges related to climate change in west Africa, approved by ministers responsible for environment and human rights in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), a statement said. The conference was the first in the region to examine the link between climate change and human rights. (Source: Republic of Togo, 17 September 2009)</p>

	A mobile phone application will help professional and “citizen” scientists collect and analyse data from “in the field”, anywhere in the world. The EpiCollect software collates data from certain mobiles - on topics such as disease spread or the occurrence of rare species - in a web-based database. The data is statistically analysed and plotted on maps that are instantly available to those same phones. The approach is outlined in the open-access journal PLoS ONE. The software has been developed for so-called smartphones that run Google's Android open-source operating system. Researchers can report back to the EpiCollect database with results from experiments they do in the field, and “citizen scientists” can send back photos or videos of certain species from their own backyards. The phones’ GPS system automatically logs users’ locations, and the data is then plotted by location using Google Maps. Then anyone can access the database online, or from their phone.

					<p>A little-known and under-reported symposium was held in Rome under the auspices of the FAO – the World Seed Conference from 8-10 September 2009. Although the subject may appear obscure, the conference theme and the issues discussed, including plant variety protection and seed improvement techniques, could not be more important to millions of farmers in the developing world. This article by Robin Willoughly, research officer at the NGO Share the World’s Resources, discusses which issues came to the fore during the conference, and suggest an alternative paradigm for agricultural development.
