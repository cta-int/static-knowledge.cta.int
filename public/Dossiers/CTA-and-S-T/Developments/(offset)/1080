						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

The initiative, led by the Global Crop Diversity Trust, working in partnership with national agricultural research institutes, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), is the largest one ever undertaken with the tough wild relatives of today's main food crops. These wild plants contain essential traits that could be bred into crops to make them more hardy and versatile in the face of dramatically different climates expected in the coming years. The Global Crop Diversity Trust will draw in climate change experts, biodiversity conservationists and agricultural scientists. Scientists will work with national governments and local partners on the ground, and the species to be collected all fall under the auspices of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. All materials will be collected and be publicly available under the terms of that Treaty.(Source: ScienceDaily, 9 December 2010.)</p>

The <a href="http://cropgenebank.sgrp.cgiar.org/" target="_blank">Crop Genebank Knowledge Base</a> (CGKB), a free online knowledge base, is one of the outputs of the second phase of the Collective Action for the Rehabilitation of Global Public Goods in the CGIAR Genetic Resources System (GPG2). The CGKB is the first online resource for genebank managers and conservationists that provides easy access to crop specific knowledge and best practices for germplasm management and a vast collection of publications and training manuals in one place. Nine crops – banana, barley, cassava, chickpea, forage grasses and legumes, maize, rice, wheat – are already featured in detail, guiding through all steps of their conservation in a genebank. In addition specific regeneration guidelines are provided for 22 crops. These crop-specific best practices and relevant information have been compiled by genebank experts of the CGIAR centres and national genebanks world-wide and peer-reviewed by crop experts. The GPG2 project, funded by the World Bank, was coordinated by the System-wide Genetic Resources Programme (SGRP) of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).(Source: CGIAR SGRP, December 2010.)</p>

	A study produced recently by researchers in Senegal and Belgian experts focusing on the ‘Science and technology’ (S&amp;T) programme of the national education strategy shows that the greatest obstacles to the selection and completion by students of studies in science and technology in schools, colleges and universities are the shortage of teachers, especially in rural areas, the lack of proper lab equipment to conduct experiments and a over-formal, antiquated method of teaching S &amp; T that is too abstract for students. Abdoulaye Samb, co-author of the study, professor at the Faculty of Science and Technology of the University Cheikh Anta Diop in Dakar (UCAD) and member of the Academy of Sciences of Senegal, proposes to build ‘Scientific and technical blocks’ (BST) that would boost the teaching of S &amp; T. The BST are special schools built to help improve quality and quantity of S &amp; T teaching. Their mission is to teach students the experimental approach and the scientific method (more details on the BST in Senegal can be found <a href="http://www.cnbst.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=2&amp;showall=1%20" target="_blank">here</a> in french).

The West African Regional Integrated Production and Pest Management (IPPM) Programme, an international project promoting sustainable farming practices, executed by the FAO, has helped farmers cut the use of toxic pesticides and diversify farming systems to increase yields and incomes. Working in small groups, called Farmer Field Schools, smallholders are developing and adopting 'good agricultural practices' through learning-by-doing and hands-on field experiments. Around 100 000 farmers in Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali and Senegal are participating in a community-driven training programme. To grow healthy crops, IPPM promotes soil improvement and alternatives to chemical pesticides such as the use of beneficial insects, adapted varieties, natural pesticides and cropping practices. Marketing and food safety issues are also part of the training programme.(Source: Africa Science News, 20 December 2010.)</p>

	According to soil scientist Francisco Calderon, from the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), infrared spectroscopy has become established practice for quick and reliable analysis of grain and forage quality, and now for the first time, fungal-root associations. The ability to quickly analyze field soils for these beneficial fungi, called <i>mycorrhizae</i>, would allow scientists to judge which crop rotations or other farming practices increase mycorrhizal fungi. This is important worldwide to improve crop yields, and especially critical in semi-arid areas. Calderon says the test could simplify, speed, and make more objective measurements of mycorrhizae in root samples compared to the standard method of visual scoring through a microscope. This research was published in the ‘Journal of Applied Spectroscopy’.(Source: USDA ARS, 8 December 2010.)</p>

Co-Founders of the Global Cassava Partnership for the 21st Century Dr. Claude Fauquet, Principal investigator at the Danforth Plant Science Center and Director of International Laboratory for Tropical Agricultural Biotechnology (ILTAB, St. Louis, USA) and Dr. Joe Tohme of CIAT in Cali (Colombia) gathered 29 prominent agricultural researchers from 14 countries, representing 17 cassava research institutions in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Europe, and North America for a three day conference in Italy, to discuss the impact of climate changes on the security food crop cassava. Experts at the conference explained how climate changes are likely to increase cassava production. New reports suggest that increases in atmospheric CO2 levels could lead to gains in yield and significant increases in the total acres dedicated to planting cassava. In addition, more frequent drought throughout most of Africa will not negatively impact cassava production like maize. Consequently, the land area dedicated to growing cassava is expected to continue to expand in the 21st Century. On the other hand, elevated rainfall in some areas will result in more disease pressure, and increased temperatures will exacerbate insect and mite infestations as well as viral diseases that have a major impact on cassava yield. These critical issues confirm the need for further research and investment in the cassava. (Source: CIAT, 1 December 2010.)</p>

The manager of the West and Central African Council for Agricultural Research and Development's (CORAF/WECARD), biosafety and biotechnology programme, Abdourahmane Sangare, has announced that the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) will implement a regional legal framework for biosecurity. This legislation, part of ECOWAS's action plan for the development of biotechnology and biosafety, will take into account national laws and regulations existing in the different member countries. ECOWAS states in its Action Plan that the creation and implementation of this regional framework will require the design of a document establishing common rules for bio-security within the Community. A regional consultation with all participatory stakeholders will be held to validate the document and harmonize regional regulation. It will establish a regional coordination and regulatory framework for biosafety and enable training of future leaders in this field. An international masters programme in tropical biotechnology, coordinated by seven African universities, is planned to start in October 2011.Source/Date (Source : AfricaJet, 12 December 2010)</p>

The RIE network is reporting on a number of technological developments that embrace the 'biomimicry' approach. It writes about a robotic arm that mimics an elephant's trunk, allowing for a high degree of flexibility and rotation, and a high sensitivity to objects. Another company has developed a water desalination system mimicking the natural pores of the cellular membranes of living organisms, a system that can filter high volume of salt water using very low energy inputs. Other innovations in biomimetrics are also presented, a bio-battery using sugar and 'live' concrete (that contains dormant bacteria). For the Caribbean, a region rich in biodiversity, the potential is high for developing technologies based on organic design. One avenue could be the conch and the natural ceramics it produces.(Source: Caribbean RIE Network, December 2010)</p>

	The FAO Subregional Office for the Pacific Islands funded the study called: <a href="http://www.faopacific.ws/Portals/167/publications/Reports/Nadi%20meeting%20reportfinal.pdf%20%20" target="_blank">'Agriculture Data — Report on a Scoping Study in Six Pacific Island Countries'</a>. Supported by conclusions from the scoping report, Pacific Island Countries plan to expand data collection on agriculture production, domestic food marketing and agriculture trade to provide decision-makers with actionable information that can be used to strengthen food security across the Pacific islands. From May to November 2010 the data scoping mission visited six Pacific Island Countries (Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu) to assess the capacity of the countries to produce, report and use data that is commonly needed to monitor national trends in agricultural production and to understand the role of the domestic agriculture sector, including local food and labour markets. An expert consultation reviewed the data scoping report on 22-23 October 2010 in Fiji and called for enhanced evidence-based decision making for sustainable agriculture development in the Pacific islands. The group urged leaders to think about policy priorities and issues to help identify key data needs. (Source: FAO Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific, 12 December 2010)</p>

	The UN Convention to Combat Desertification launch of the 'decade for deserts' (<a href="http://unddd.unccd.int/index.htm" target="_blank">http://unddd.unccd.int/index.htm</a>) initiative took place on 16-17 December 2010 in London (UK). The meeting was organised to mark the European launch of the UN's 'decade for deserts' and the fight against desertification, which will run from 2010-2020. The initiative aims to raise awareness of the issue among policymakers and financial donors. According to participants of the meeting, the climate change agenda, in particular its 'overemphasis' on forests, has overlooked drylands and their potential role as carbon sinks. Destruction of nutrient rich top soil as a result of factors such as over-intensive agriculture continues be a problem throughout the world and is advancing the desertification of drylands, such as those in Africa and the Mediterranean. Participants to the meeting called for a greater recognition of the value of drylands as ecosystems. (Source: Ethiopia Flora Network, 17 December 2010)</p>

	The Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR) has established the Intellectual Property Rights Office (IPRO) at its headquarters (Addis Ababa). There were no recognized and systematic rules and regulations to best govern institutional as well as system-wide intellectual property requests when the office was created. A two-day workshop was set-up in Addis Ababa early December 2010, to validate a model intellectual property rights guideline and policy for public research institutions and universities. Participants were drawn from different universities, agricultural research institutions in the country and the ministry of Science and Technology (MoST). A background paper on the need for effective institutional intellectual property in universities and research and development institutions was presented by MoST. Model policy and guidelines of Addis Ababa University and EIAR were also presented and discussed for more amendments. The Workshop was ended by massive suggestions for amendment and the way forward to implement the guidelines and policies of IPR in Ethiopia.

	In the Caribbean, as in other parts of the world, food crisis may become an enduring reality in the next few years. In that region however, as agricultural land is limited, large scale extensive agriculture will not be the response to food shortages. On the smaller islands in the Caribbean, only what is now known as &quot;protected agriculture&quot; could potentially be the answer to future produce shortages. Dr Janet Lawrence of CARDI recently presented comparative figures for yields of field tomatoes versus tomatoes grown in low-tech protected cropping units (a type of &quot;protected agriculture&quot;) in Jamaica. The difference in yield was a staggering 1000% more in that protected environment. The gross margin for one grower using a protected environment was over 1700% more than field growing. Dr Lawrence also reported that the yields for growers using protected cropping systems were 400% more and the gross margins were at least 48% of gross revenue. Protective agriculture is used extensively in Holland and Spain. Using these high yield methods In the Caribbean presents new problems like higher pest loading, natural disasters risks (hurricanes) and warm and humid climate. According to Dr Lawrence, taking into account these regional environmental conditions should translate into the fabrication of smart infrastructure designs for protected agriculture specific to the region. Lawrence described a number of structural innovations developed in the Caribbean which facilitate the quick 'deconstruction' of protected cropping facilities in advance of severe storm situations heat stress in warm climates. As for the risk of heat stress, Marta Torrelas, a specialist in biosystems engineering at IRTA in Spain, noted a number of technologies available that help manage temperature. Options include evaporative cooling, cooling of irrigation water to reduce soil and root temperatures, partial shading. Solar powered air-conditioning may also become a possible low-cost option before too long. Much work has been done here in the Caribbean by CARDI, other agencies, and commercial growers to adapt protected cropping systems normally used in temperate climate region to the warmer Caribbean conditions. The 300% - 1000% increases in productivity that can be achieved using such systems should encourage their adoption by growers in the region. (Source: Caribbean RIE Network, December 2010)</p>

	The Pacific Islands Forum and European Union launched in mid-December 2010 the 'Joint Pacific-EU Initiative on Climate Change'. The Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum, Tuiloma Neroni Slade, met with European Commissioner for Development, Andris Piebalgs, on 15 December 2010 and through signature of a Memorandum of Understanding, launched the joint initiative. Mr Slade welcomed this cooperation with the European Union and its member states as a practical and effective way forward to respond to the dangers of climate change and to the concerns of the Pacific communities. The joint initiative recognises ongoing work on climate change being carried out by Forum member countries and by relevant regional organisations. It seeks broader support by building on the Pacific's key international partnerships. The Memorandum of Understanding is the first step towards a joint integrated strategy to address climate change in the Pacific. The objective is to mobilise EU Member States and international partners to join efforts to reinforce Pacific Countries' capacity to address more efficiently climate change impacts.

Andrés González, coordinator of the Joint Programme on Integration of Ecosystems and Adaptation to Climate Change in the Colombian Massif (South America) says the wide-ranging knowledge about climate variation possessed by native people and other small farmers, such as the people in one region of Colombia, is almost a perfect match to scientific measurements recorded on high-tech instruments. In the southwestern part of Colombia, indigenous people and scientists are working together on ways to adapt to climate change. A network of seed savers (&quot;guardianes&quot;) has been set up to preserve the seeds of tubers, maize, fruit trees, fodder species, quinoa, amaranth and other food crops of high nutritional value, and to promote seed exchanges among the autonomous indigenous reserves of the region. Plots of land to acclimatise the seeds have also been created, as well as six agricultural schools where scientists and small farmers study and discuss food security, sustainable production, risk management and healthy environments. The project, sponsored by the Millennium Development Goals Achievement Fund (MDG-F), is headed by a team that includes representatives of native communities which act as counterparts to the technicians and experts from the programme, that wants to encourage dialogue between academia and small (and/or indigenous) farmers on the nature and effects of climate change.(Source: IPS, 2 December 2010)</p>

The Institute of Marine Resources (IMR, University of the South Pacific, Fiji) has been awarded €270 000 for its project 'Value-adding and supply chain development for fisheries and aquaculture products in Fiji, Samoa and Tonga'. The funding is spread over a 2.5-year period, and is managed between the University of the South Pacific (USP), Secretariat of the Pacific Community, and three Australian universities. The focus of the project is on the potential enhancement of the supply chain and value adding of two selected commodities in Fiji, Samoa and Tonga, namely tilapia and the seaweed Caulerpa. For tilapia, which is a common aquaculture species in Fiji (not in Samoa or Tonga) the focus will be on the development of a reliable supply chain, and on value-adding such as kippering, smoking, and products such as surimi and re-formed fish fillets. For Caulerpa, which is a hand-harvested delicacy in all three countries, the main focus will be on developing a reliable supply chain and researching and building on previous work on enhancing the very short shelf-life. The Division of Marine Studies post-harvest laboratory will be actively involved in the project, under the supervision of Dr Jimaima Lako, Lecturer in Post-Harvest Fisheries.Source (Source: IMR, University of the South Pacific, November 2010)</p>

	According to the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), pests - particularly the Maruca vitrata pod borer - currently cause losses of up to US$300 million for smallholder farmers in Africa. A technology developed by Purdue University (USA) in collaboration with African researchers, known as Purdue Improved Cowpea Storage (PICS), answered to the problem of cowpea bugs by using non-chemical, hermetic storage. PICS has been introduced in West, Central and East Africa where farmers are exposed to harmful chemicals while protecting their cowpea grains against insects. In Nigeria, Africa's major producer with 1.5 million tons annually, net gains from not using pesticides have been estimated to be in the region of US$500 million. Jess Lowenberg-DeBoer, a Professor of agricultural economics and director of the international programmes in agriculture at Purdue University, explains that PICS works by sealing cowpeas in an airtight container, which kills all the adult insects and most of the larvae within days. At the same time the triple bags keep the remaining larvae dormant and unable to damage the seeds. (Source: New Agriculturalist, December 2010)</p>

	An article about the potential value proposition of sustainable fashion for the Caribbean fashion industry. Multinational clothing retail chains are changing their business plan to include more products from sustainable and organic processes. The Caribbean and its diversity of commodities used in the fashion industry are benefiting from the changes. Accessory and fashion designers from the Caribbean region have been following closely these changes in consumer demand and are answering with good success the consumer's expectations with the developments of innovative products made from natural dyes, wood, and plants produced in the Caribbean.

	A story about a small business in Guyana that has been developing innovative ways to add value to one of the most widespread commodities in the Caribbean, coconut. Raymond and Bernice Trotz, both qualified agriculturalists, set up an agri-processing venture to develop a range of packaged products that added value to coconut water. They developed new and innovative ways to market the water, and, following a well thought business plan, the company is now expanding the range of products it offers. It is a rich example of how regional mass produced commodities can be transformed into high-value specialist products. (Source: Caribbean RIE Network, December 2010)</p>

	The Caribbean region produces special types of cocoa - in particular Trinitario and Criollo. Most of the beans are exported overseas and used in the production of specialist high quality chocolate products sold for high profits on European and American markets. Growers in the Caribbean see little of these profits as they receive just 3-4% of the end retail price. However, a new breed of entrepreneurs is working hard to make sure that more of the high-end market value comes back into the region. Isabel Brash is one of such young innovative entrepreneur. After a learning journey to discover the scientific and technical processes behind the manufacturing of high-quality chocolate, Brash decided to create premium chocolate products from the cocoa beans produced on her family estate, and other local produce like fruit puree and ginger. The high value exquisite products her company now brings to the market have received international praise and are selling well. Having adopted an ethical business plan, Brash's company can now more fairly distribute to the cocoa growers the income generated (20% of retail price). With local resources and a talent for innovation, Brash has created the type of enterprise that is changing the way local small growers profit from their production.
