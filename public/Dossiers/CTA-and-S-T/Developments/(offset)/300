						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Fiji's Department of Energy has a biofuel implementation programme, and this webpage serves as a portal to the department’s various projects. The department has successfully commissioned and installed three biofuel mills on the islands of Koro, Rotuma and Cicia. These mills are to serve the communities in terms of a consistent supply of clean green fuel and to uplift the standard of living through the provision of economic activity that is associated with the mills. Each mill has been designed to cater for the copra produced in all three islands. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fdoe.gov.fj/index.php/energy-security/biofuel/biofuel-implementation-projects" target="_self">http://www.fdoe.gov.fj/index.php/energy-security/biofuel/biofuel-implementation-projects</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(FDOE, 2013)</p>

					<p>Ian Boyd, Chief Scientific Adviser at the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, UK, explains why science is an essential component of policy-making. In Boyd's opinion, the scientific community does not always understand its role in this process. Science advice for policy faces two difficulties, the issue of where authoritative comment stops and political point of view starts, and the low-dimensional view of a multi-dimensional (or complex) problem usually taken by scientists. These two difficulties create a gap between the scientists' views of what policy outcomes should look like, and what these outcomes actually are once they have been through the mangle of policy development. This can be the source of dissatisfaction among scientists and can create an unsatisfactory dynamic between scientists and policy-makers. The role of science should be to provide information to those having to make decisions, including the public, and to ensure that the uncertainties around that information are made clear. It is thus important for scientists to stick to the evidence and its interpretation. Boyd uses a recent example involving the control of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in the UK to illustrate his point. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://elife.elifesciences.org/content/2/e01061" target="_self">http://elife.elifesciences.org/content/2/e01061</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>eLife</i>, 02/07/2013)</p>

					<p>The Joint Research Programming Initiative on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change (FACCE-JPI), jointly led by INRA and BBSRC, celebrates its 3-year anniversary with the launch of its first biennial Implementation Plan, show-casing the role of FACCE-JPI in the research on the interplay between agriculture, food security and climate change. The Plan addresses subjects that are central to FACCE’s ambitions, for example the improvement of agricultural soil quality, the sustainable intensification of European crop and livestock systems and plant disease epidemiology under climate change. It also foresees the creation of a network of experimental climate change studies on crop and grassland systems. After three years of activity and already five joint actions launched, FACCE-JPI is no longer working at the level of coordination of national policies, but more ambitiously on alignment and convergence of these, around a commonly agreed Strategic Research Agenda (SRA). &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://presse.inra.fr/en/Resources/Press-releases/three-years-of-Joint-Programming-with-FACCE-JPI" target="_self">http://presse.inra.fr/en/Resources/Press-releases/three-years-of-Joint-Programming-with-FACCE-JPI</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(INRA, 13/11/2013) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>In January 2014, the Global Young Academy (GYA) published 'The Global State of Young Scientists' (GloSYS). This report, authored by Catherine Beaudry (Canada) and Irene Friesenhahn (Germany), provides a snapshot of recent scientific literature and new analyses of the state of young scholars in different world regions. GloSYS identified global deficits and a need for action in the following areas: Mentoring and support structures; focused training; transparency and fairness; working conditions; and cultivating values. The GloSYS study provides a framework, against which future progress can be monitored. The central findings of a precursor project and the resulting recommendations from GloSYS can serve as a basis to improve the state of young researchers throughout the world. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.interacademies.net/News/PressReleases/23349.aspx" target="_self">http://www.interacademies.net/News/PressReleases/23349.aspx</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(GYA, 21/1/2014) &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

					<p>To understand better the importance of the different traits that make up the quality of the rice grain and obtain a full picture of rice quality demographics, a research team led by Mariafe Calingacion of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has engaged with local experts across the world to perform a full assessment of all major rice quality trait characteristics and importantly, to determine how these are combined in the most preferred varieties for each of their regions. Physical as well as biochemical characteristics have been monitored and this has resulted in the identification of no less than 18 quality trait combinations. This complexity reveals the extent of the specificity of consumer preference. Further assessment of these combinations at the variety level reveals that several groups still comprise varieties which consumers can readily identify as being different. This emphasises the shortcomings in the current tools available to assess rice quality. Only with additional tools and research, will it be possible to define directed strategies for rice breeding which are able to combine important agronomic features with the demands of local consumers for specific quality attributes. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0085106" target="_self">http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0085106</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>PLOS ONE</i>, 14/01/2014) &nbsp;</p>

					<p>Dalal Al-Abdulrazzak and Daniel Pauly of the University of British Columbia, Canada, looked at recent technological advances that could help with the monitoring of fishery catches. Statistics submitted by countries to the FAO frequently neglect or under-report the contribution of small-scale fisheries, as well as illegal catches and discards. Trying to tackle this problem, the researchers have used freely available global satellite imagery via Google Earth, to count intertidal fishing weirs off the coast of six countries in the Persian Gulf. Combining the number of weirs with assumptions about daily catches and the length of the fishing season they estimated that the fishing gear contributed to a regional catch is up to six times higher than the officially reported catches. These results provide the first example of fisheries catch estimates from space, and point to the potential for remote-sensing approaches to validate catch statistics in fisheries. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/11/27/icesjms.fst178.1" target="_self">http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/11/27/icesjms.fst178.1</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>ICES Journal of Marine Science</i>, 17/09/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Jessica Blythe and colleagues from the University of Victoria, Canada draw on case study research in Mozambique that combines national landings statistics and career history interviews with fish harvesters to generate a historical description of social-ecological interactions within the coastal Mozambican fishery. At the national level, the analysis points toward trends of fishing intensification and decline in targeted species, and it highlights the significant impact of small-scale fisheries on marine stocks. At the local level, fishermen are experiencing changes in fish abundance and distribution and in their physical, social, and cultural environments, and have responded by increasing their fishing effort (with bigger nets and bigger boats). Implication of these findings for future governance point to a need to better understand the socio-ecological drivers of change in fishing behaviour of coastal communities.

					<p>IRIN reports on today’s difficulties faced by the small scale fishermen in Mozambique. Among the most pressing challenges affecting the livelihoods of the country's small scale fishing sector are invasive species, illegal fishing practices and rapid economic and population growth. A new type of prawn is taking over the habitat from the local, much tastier prawns that are in demand internationally, providing only little returns for the fishermen. Also apparent are the proliferation of illegal fishing gear like chicocota nets, made of mosquito nets, to catch even the smallest prey. In addition the destruction of mangroves has drastically cut the potential for stock regeneration of staple fish. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.irinnews.org/Report/99513/Mozambique-s-small-scale-fishermen-battle-headwinds" target="_self">www.irinnews.org/Report/99513/Mozambique-s-small-scale-fishermen-battle-headwinds</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(IRIN, 22/01/2014) &nbsp;</p>

					<p>This article by Ola T. Westengen and Anne K Brysting from the University of Oslo, Norway, present a case study of the role of genetic resources and seed systems in adapting to climatic stress from in semi-arid agro-ecological zone of Tanzania. In this case, crop adaptation involves the adoption of improved maize varieties combined with continued use of local varieties of both maize and sorghum. Analysis shows that households receiving extension service and owning livestock are more likely to switch to drought-tolerant varieties as a response to climatic stress than those without these assets. The seed system in the study area consists of both formal and informal elements. The informal channels supply the highest quantities of both sorghum and maize seeds. Recycling of improved varieties of maize is common and the majority of households practice seed selection. Detailed assessment of the three different categories of genetic resources – local, improved and farmer-recycled varieties – reveals that drought tolerance is more frequently reported as a reason for growing local varieties than for growing improved varieties of maize and sorghum. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.agricultureandfoodsecurity.com/content/3/1/3/abstract" target="_self">http://www.agricultureandfoodsecurity.com/content/3/1/3/abstract</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Agriculture and Food Security</i>, 01/02/2014)</p>

					<p>A team of European and African researchers, hoping to fill the gap in information about the status and evolution of farmland biodiversity, recently invented and piloted a new toolbox, the 'BioBio indicator set', which measures 23 different instances of biodiversity across a variety of farm types and scales in Europe. Applications were also tested in Tunisia, Ukraine, and Uganda, where they proved a feasible starting point for adapting the toolbox to the agricultural context of different countries. In an agricultural context, biodiversity - genetic, species and habitat diversity- and its characteristics are particularly important, yet not much is known about farmland biodiversity and how it is sustained. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thesolutionsjournal.com/node/23997" target="_self">http://www.thesolutionsjournal.com/node/23997</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>Solutions</i>,10/2013)</p>

					<p>Cissé Ibrahima and colleagues from the Institut National d'Hygiène Publique (INHP, Côte d'Ivoire) and CIRAD, studied the biochemical characteristics of the fruit pulp of five endemic baobab species from Madagascar and one from Côte d’Ivoire. Contents in vitamin C, polyphenols, lipids, proteins and minerals were evaluated. Comparing the results for each species, the researchers found high variability in biochemical characteristics and mineral content between the various species. None of them could be identified as a clear all-round winner. To date, despite the baobab fruit's nutritional importance, the lack of knowledge on pulp preservation causes loss.

					<p>SUNRAY was a collaborative effort by 4 European universities, 4 universities from sub-Saharan Africa, a non-governmental organisation and a institution that funds research in Africa to identify priorities for nutrition research in sub-Saharan Africa. SUNRAY was conducted from January 2010 until December 2012. The findings are summarised in a number of manuscripts. A paper summarises the findings of the SUNRAY on priorities for nutrition research and enabling environment is published in <a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1001593" target="_self"><i>Plos Medicine</i></a>. The views of African researchers on how the operating environment for nutrition research can be improved in sub-Saharan Africa were published in <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0066355" target="_self"><i>PLOS ONE</i></a>. As an outcome of this SUNRAY, a <a href="http://sunrayafrica.co.za/sunray_cms/downloads/dynamic/compound_text_content/sunray_roadmap_english_1__english.pdf" target="_self">Roadmap for nutrition research</a> in sub-Saharan Africa was circulated for consultation internationally. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The priority areas identified for nutrition research were (i) community interventions to improve nutritional status, (ii) behavioural strategies to improve nutritional status, and (iii) food security interventions to improve nutrition. The priority actions identified for creating an enabling nutrition research environment were (i) better governance of nutrition research, (ii) alignment of nutrition research funding with priorities identified within SSA, (iii) increased capacity development for nutrition research competencies, and (iv) enhanced information sharing and communication of nutrition research findings. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://sunrayafrica.co.za/sunray_cms/index.php?frontend_action=display_compound_text_content&amp;item_id=1079" target="_self">http://sunrayafrica.co.za/sunray_cms/index.php?frontend_action=display_compound_text_content&amp;item_id=1079</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(SUNRAY initiative, 28/01/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>A new study of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA, Austria), published in the journal <i>Global Change Biology,</i> demonstrates that a growing imbalance between phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizer use in Africa would lead to crop yield reductions of nearly 30% by 2050. Underuse of phosphorus-based fertilizers in Africa currently contributes to a growing yield gap – the difference between how much crops could produce in ideal circumstances compared to actual yields. This phosphorus-specific yield gap currently lies at around 10% for subsistence farmers, but will grow to 27% by 2050 if current trends continue. While nitrogen-based fertilizer usage has begun to increase in Africa in the last 10 years, the application of phosphorus to cropland has not kept pace, leading to a growing imbalance between nitrogen and phosphorus levels in soil. The new study shows that increases in nitrogen and phosphorus inputs must happen in a way that provides crops with the balanced nutrient input they need. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/news/20140128-phosphorus-africa.html" target="_self">http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/news/20140128-phosphorus-africa.html</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(IIASA, 28/01/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Crop-livestock production systems are the largest cause of human alteration of the global nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycles. This research report by Mario Herrero (ed) of ILRI is a comprehensive spatially explicit inventory of N and P budgets in livestock and crop production systems. It shows that in the beginning of the 20th century, nutrient budgets were either balanced and surpluses if any were small and that between 1900 and 1950, global soil N surplus almost doubled and P surplus increased by a factor of 8. Between 1950 and 2000, the global surplus of N increased by almost 400% and that of P to more than 500%. Most surplus N is an environmental loss and surplus P is lost by runoff or accumulates as residual soil P. Despite rapidly increasing recovery of N and P in crop and livestock, global nutrient surpluses continue to increase. Alternative management of livestock production systems shows that combinations of intensification, better integration of animal manure in crop production, and matching N and P supply to livestock requirements can effectively reduce nutrient flows. A shift in human diets, with poultry or pork replacing beef, can reduce nutrient flows in countries with intensive ruminant production. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/110/52/20882.full" target="_self">http://www.pnas.org/content/110/52/20882.full</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>PNAS</i>, 24/12/2013) &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

Some new features have also been added. For instance, as before the user can pick any point on the earth’s surface and generate daily weather data for that point. Now, the user can also plot climate data, in terms of the monthly mean values of rainfall and daily maximum and minimum temperature. In addition, MarkSim GCM can be used to generate daily data that are to some extent characteristic of future climates. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://ccafs.cgiar.org/blog/new-updates-marksimgcm-weather-generator#.UvJUO7Qp_jI" target="_self">http://ccafs.cgiar.org/blog/new-updates-marksimgcm-weather-generator#.UvJUO7Qp_jI</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(CGIAR CCAFS, 27/01/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>In this study, Tom Gleeson (McGill University, Canada) and Yoshihide Wada (Utrecht University, The Netherlands) analyze and interpret groundwater stress across whole nations using multiple data sources for the first time. They focus on two nations with the highest national groundwater abstraction rates in the world, the United States and India, and use recently developed groundwater footprints and multiple datasets of groundwater recharge and withdrawal derived from hydrologic models and data synthesis. The results indicate that the uncertainty is generally greater between datasets than within datasets and that much of the uncertainty is due to recharge estimates. Assessment of groundwater stress consistently across a nation and assessment of uncertainty using multiple datasets are critical for the development of a science-based rationale for policy and management, especially with regard to where and to what extent to focus limited research and management resources. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/4/044010/article" target="_self">http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/4/044010/article</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Environmental Research Letters</i>, 16/10/2013) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>South Africa could soon have a cluster of up to seven cosmic-ray moisture probes installed in agricultural, forestry and remote areas. These probes use cosmic-ray neutrons to deliver up-to-date readings of the moisture content of soil. Soil moisture is inversely related to the neutrons in the air above the soil surface. State of the art equipment using infrared analysers and three dimensional sonic anemometers will be used to complement the soil water cosmic-ray probe footprint for studies on the effects of soil moisture dynamics on plant water and carbon exchange. The probes have the potential to provide hydro-meteorologists with new methods of evaluating surface soil water. The continuous data streams linked to the new Cosmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS) continental-scale network will be of relevance to hydro-meteorologists interested in land-atmosphere interactions, ecologists interested in the impact of soil water on ecological status and evolution, remote sensing scientists for soil moisture calibration and validation, surface-water and groundwater modellers, and agricultural scientists interested in understanding and predicting the relationship between soil moisture and crop yield. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://goo.gl/M6w7TA" target="_self">http://goo.gl/M6w7TA</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(Farmer's Weekly, 30/01/2014) &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
