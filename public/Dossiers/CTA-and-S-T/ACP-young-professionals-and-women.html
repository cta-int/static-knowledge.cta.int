						<dt><a href="../../en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation.html">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="../../en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems.html">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	<b>Dr Hagan</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>was awarded the third prize in the </i>Young Professionals<i>&nbsp;</i>in Science<i>&nbsp;competition. He commented that the most relevant result of his research was the development of chicken breeds that can be highly productive under the hot and humid environments of the tropics. ‘The breeds I have developed are able to produce optimally under heat stress conditions and thereby increase productivity of egg production and hence improve Africa’s food security.’ He told </i>Knowledge for Development<i>&nbsp;that the award is a confirmation that his research has an actual practical impact. ‘It opened doors to international collaboration, helped me to build a research network in my field and to get a promotion as a lecturer in my university. I hope that in five years time I will be an internationally recognised expert in local chicken production and that my work will have&nbsp; a positive impact on food security.’ &nbsp;</i></p>

	<b>Dr Rimberia</b><i>was rewarded the fifth prize in the </i>Women in Science<i> competition. She explains to </i>Knowledge for development<i> that the most relevant result of her project is the finding that the production of clean and healthy papaya plantlets of known sex can solve the farmers’ inability to differentiate among the papaya’s 3 sex types at seedling stage. She found that healthy orchards with the correct mix of one male to nine female plants will increase fruit yield greatly compared to the current situation where farmers use guess work. Farmers will be able to grow more fruits and the papaya industry will be able to produce more yoghurt and beauty products. ‘This award will increase my visibility in the research community and that of my university. Hopefully, it will help me get a promotion at my university and more funding for research projects. In five years time ‘I will be an associate professor with four patents to my name and many scientific publications.’ &nbsp;</i></p>

	<b>Dr Rugira</b><i>, who won the fifth prize in the </i>Young Professionals<i> </i>in Science<i> competition, told </i>Knowledge for Development<i> that the most relevant result of his research was developing a much cheaper feed for rearing pigs and getting farmers to adopt a new pig breed that provides better quality pork. ‘More meat of better quality will now become available to Africans, improving their protein intake. The livelihoods of pig farmers will also improve through the generation of extra income and savings made on feed.’ He continued that ‘the recognition means we can build on our research for further action-research to address livestock related issues. This award energized me and makes me feel that good science is appreciated irrespective of the subject matter.’ In five years Dr Rugira expects to be at the peak of his scientific career and hopes that he will be ‘mentoring other Africans researchers, publishing at free will, winning bigger research grants and possibly leading a research organisation.’ &nbsp;</i></p>

	<b>Dr Binso </b><i>won the fourth prize in the </i>Women in Science<i> competition. In her interview with </i>Knowledge for Development<i> she explained that her research had shown that hermetic triple bagging is effective in reducing post-harvest losses of cereal and legume grains without the use of insecticide. ‘Hermetic triple bagging technology is a viable alternative because it is effective in reducing grain storage losses and it provides farmers the flexibility to store and sell when prices are high’. She expects that effective extension approaches will lead to quick adoption and commercialisation of the bagging method among smallholder farmers and thus will improve food security through steady supply of quality grain. ‘This recognition means a lot to my career and should serve as an encouragement to women scientists whose research contributes to food security. It gives me confidence to commit myself more to research that supports smallholder farmers, especially rural women to improve their livelihood.’ In five years time Dr Binso sees herself as a specialist in crop storage and an advocate of triple bagging technology. &nbsp;</i></p>

	The decision to host the Africa-wide science competitions targeting African women and young professionals in science was taken by the FARA General Assembly at its 4th meeting in South Africa in 2007. Professor Monty Jones, the former executive director, FARA had readily agreed to partner with CTA, ANAFE, RUFORUM and the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency in hosting these competitions. The Finals of the 2nd round of competitions was held at the 5th FARA GA in Burkina Faso and the decision was taken by the GA to continue to organize the science competitions. In 2012, the partnership was expanded to include the International Foundation for Science (IFS), Sweden.&nbsp;Find the abstracts here:&nbsp;<a href="Developments/Abstracts-CTA-FARA-IFS-ANAFE-RUFORUM-NPCA-AGRA-3rd-Africa-wide-Women-and-Young-Professionals-in-Science-Competitions.html" target="_self">http://knowledge.cta.int/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/Abstracts-CTA-FARA-IFS-ANAFE-RUFORUM-NPCA-AGRA-3rd-Africa-wide-Women-and-Young-Professionals-in-Science-Competitions</a>Update:<a href="Developments/6th-Africa-Science-Week-and-FARA-General-Assembly-Side-Event-Programme-for-Finals-of-3rd-Africa-wide-Science-competitions.html" target="_self">&nbsp;6th Africa Science Week and FARA General Assembly Side Event: Programme for Finals of 3rd Africa-wide Science competitions</a>Update:&nbsp;<a href="Developments/Top-20-finalists-of-the-3rd-Africa-wide-women-and-young-professionals-in-science-competitions.html" target="_self">Top 20 finalists of the 3rd Africa-wide women and young professionals in science competitions</a>Update: <a href="ACP-young-professionals-and-women/Update-October-2012-CTA-FARA-IFS-ANAFE-RUFORUM-NEPAD-AGRA-3rd-Africa-Wide-Women-and-Young-Professionals-in-Science-Competitions.html" target="_self">October 2012, CTA/ FARA/ IFS/ ANAFE/ RUFORUM/ NEPAD/ AGRA 3rd Africa Wide Women and Young Professionals in Science Competitions</a></p>

					<p>This document contains the proceedings of a national workshop in India on ‘Foresight and Future Pathways of Agricultural Research through Youth’ (March 2013). It was concluded that young agri-professionals face a major challenge in combating food insecurity. To be successful, they will have to utilise their skills in an exceptional manner and for that tertiary agricultural education must ensure: (a) effective communication of science in agriculture, (b) integration of social media in agriculture, (c) promotion of agriculture as a career path, and (d) networking capacity to influence national agenda. Also identified was the need to communicate a more positive image of agriculture to young people, promote high school agriculture, and related agriculture literacy programmes. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.apaari.org/publications/agri-research-thru-youth-in-india.html" target="_self">http://www.apaari.org/publications/agri-research-thru-youth-in-india.html</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(APAARI, 2013)</p>

					<p>In March 2012 the Future Agricultures Consortium and the Institute of Statistical, Social, and Economic Research co-hosted an international conference on 'Young People, Farming and Food' in Accra, Ghana. This conference examined how young people engage with the agri-food sector in Africa and how research findings were being integrated into policy processes.It also explored the dynamics of change in different components of the agri-food sector and the implications for young people. The articles in this IDS Bulletin are drawn from the conference. They discuss social and economic structures, aspirations, livelihoods, land and policy, and illustrate the multiple dimensions, scales and complex dynamics of the young people and agriculture 'problem' – and why simplistic 'solutions' are likely to fail. It is hoped that this collection will stimulate the research to fill an evidence gap of very significant proportions.(IDS Bulletin Vol. 43, Is. 6, 11/2012)<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/idsb.2012.43.issue-6/issuetoc" target="_self">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/idsb.2012.43.issue-6/issuetoc</a></p>

					<p>The CGIAR research programme on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) posted a blog entry commenting the newly released Working Paper ‘Participatory gender-sensitive approaches for addressing key climate change-related research issues’. That paper moves from theory to practice through the testing of pre-prepared participatory research tools in Bangladesh, Ghana and Uganda.The rationale behind the manual and the field tests was to get a better understanding of the reality female and male farmers face, and find gender-differences that impede climate change adaptation. The researchers investigated if and how farming practices are being modified to deal with a changing environment, and the constraints and opportunities these changes pose for both men and women. Results from the field show that farmers, depending on gender, age and context face a different reality and various degrees of vulnerability. For instance in Bangladesh, cultural norms prevent unmarried women to travel, whereas in Ghana the women stated that access to transport and finances are not available preventing them to travel very far. This would impede the travel required to visit climate analogue sites. The authors conclude that these kinds of constraints need to be reflected in planned climate change adaptation projects.(Thanks Cecilia Shubert, CCAFS research programme; 23/8/2012)</p>

	Fourty-four (44) semi-finalists of the 3rd Africa-wide CTA/FARA/IFS/ ANAFE/RUFORUM/NEPAD/AGRA Women and Young Professionals in Science competitions, participated in a &quot;Scientific-writing, Policy Advocacy and Communication Training workshop&quot; in Uganda from 24-28 September, 2012. The workshop was held in conjunction with the 3rd RUFORUM Biennial Conference. Semi-finalists also attended selected plenary sessions and networked with senior government and university officials, donors and RUFORUM alumni.One of the semi-finalists wrote to Judith Ann Francis, Senior Programme Coordinator, Science and Technology Policy, CTA saying; &quot;This is Julius Hagan (PhD), one of the young professional scientists from Ghana. I would like to express my profound appreciation to the entire CTA team, Dr. Ekaya - RUFORUM and Prof. Obura - lead trainer and other associate sponsors (FARA, IFS, ANAFE, NEPAD, AGRA) for the competition and for the training workshop you organised for the semi-finalists. For some of us, it was an opportunity, once in a lifetime. Thanks for the exposure, accommodation, food, return ticket, per diem and the training. I promise to put into action all that I was taught. I really appreciate everything and promise to work hard to be among the top 10 finalists to represent my country in the finals. Once again thanks for the international exposure&quot;.The semi-finalists are now required to revise their draft papers which they worked on during the Uganda training workshop. The final papers must be submitted by the November deadline. They will be peer reviewed and evaluated by the expert panel. The top 10 in each competition, Women and Young Professionals in Science, will then vie for the top prizes at the FARA General Assembly in Ghana, in June 2013.See the full size picture of the participants <a href="../../Media/Images/Picture-of-participants-3rd-Africa-Wide-Women-and-Young-Professionals-in-Science-Competitions.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
