						<dt><a href="../../../en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation.html">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="../../../en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems.html">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

The first phase of the Nelson Mandela African Institute for Science and Technology (NM-AIST) in Arusha, Tanzania will be completed mid 2011. The institution's vice chancellor Prof. Burton Mwamila indicated that students’ admission would start in late 2011. He pointed out that the college would only enrol students who will pursue post-graduate degrees (doctorate and masters) in various scientific and engineering disciplines. Students would be enrolled from 18 African countries which have shown interest in the project. Nearly half a dozen other colleges/campuses are being set up in other parts of the continent under the Nelson Mandela Foundation. The Arusha campus is devoted to science and technology.(Source: The Citizen, Tanzania; 27 December 2010)</p>

Last December, the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation – ACP/EU (CTA), the Caribbean Council for Science and Technology (CCST), the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI), the University of the West Indies (UWI), the National Institute of Higher Education Research Science and Technology (NIHERST) and the Trinidad &amp; Tobago Film Company (TTFC) hosted a training workshop on film and video production for successful entrants who had participated in Phase 1 of the Caribbean Science and Agriculture Film and Video Competition for Young Professionals. The training included script writing and the importance of research; camera and lighting techniques; microphone &amp; audio techniques; interviewing tips &amp; techniques; editing/post production techniques; introduction to Adobe Photoshop for video editors and Adobe After Effects and creating 2D Animation in after effects. Entries were received from 39 teams from eight countries; Jamaica, Barbados, St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, St. Lucia, Haiti, Grenada, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago and 60 members received training. Five teams have opted to use animation while the majority of teams prefer to utilize the video or film medium. Themes for the productions include “New technologies and youth in agriculture” which is by far the dominant category, followed by “importance of agricultural innovation” and “climate change”. Other topics included water scarcity, biotechnology, and exploring niche markets. The next phase of the competition will be the production and submission of the final film or video for screening and evaluation. Organizers will provide the young professionals with mentors to ensure the scientific and technical merit of their final submissions. An awards ceremony will be held later this year when the short listed teams will vie for the top awards. The pieces will be aired on stations throughout the region and hopefully will also be used in classroom teaching.(Source: CCST, January 2011)</p>

	A study produced recently by researchers in Senegal and Belgian experts focusing on the ‘Science and technology’ (S&amp;T) programme of the national education strategy shows that the greatest obstacles to the selection and completion by students of studies in science and technology in schools, colleges and universities are the shortage of teachers, especially in rural areas, the lack of proper lab equipment to conduct experiments and a over-formal, antiquated method of teaching S &amp; T that is too abstract for students. Abdoulaye Samb, co-author of the study, professor at the Faculty of Science and Technology of the University Cheikh Anta Diop in Dakar (UCAD) and member of the Academy of Sciences of Senegal, proposes to build ‘Scientific and technical blocks’ (BST) that would boost the teaching of S &amp; T. The BST are special schools built to help improve quality and quantity of S &amp; T teaching. Their mission is to teach students the experimental approach and the scientific method (more details on the BST in Senegal can be found <a href="http://www.cnbst.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=2&amp;showall=1%20" target="_blank">here</a> in french).

This project contributes to the reduction of rural youth unemployment by increasing the ability of youths to access sustainable livelihood options. This will be achieved by capacitating rural youth through the provision of skills training and increased access to post harvest production facilities. The project aims at increasing the number of youths in the targeted communities within the parishes of St Thomas, St Ann, Trelawny and Manchester, who are actively employed or earning a living directly or indirectly through agriculture. The project which is made possible through the US1.25 million support from United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is an initiative of the Scientific Research Council (SRC) and the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ) in partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MOA) and other stakeholders.

	The Federal Government of Nigeria, through the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) has donated science kits to selected junior secondary schools across the country. The kits, which contain basic science equipment, accessories, charts and models, where distributed in every provincial state. They are meant to improve the quality of teaching and learning, as well as to change the negative perception that students have about science subjects. Nigeria’s Minister of Education, Prof. Ruqayyatu Rufa'I, said the intervention was a wakeup call for states to complement the federal government effort by procuring more kits until all junior secondary schools have adequately benefited from the initiative.

Internships are designed to provide hands-on learning experiences in research program management - in the creation, dissemination and utilization of knowledge from an international perspective. The interns will undertake a program of research on the topic submitted when competing for the internship award during a part (often around 50%) of their time. For approximately 50% of the remainder of the time, the selected candidates will be expected to provide support to management and program staff. Deadline: September 12, 2010</p>

					<p>The TWAS/BioVisionAlexandria.NXT(BVA.NXT) initiative was launched in BioVisionAlexandria 2008, where the Bibliotheca Alexandrina hosted 99 young scientists from 27 developing countries to discuss the problems these scientists face when conducting research in their respective countries.
TWAS/BVA.NXT 2010 will be the second BioVisionAlexandira.NXT to be organized in Alexandria. It will revolve around one of the main concerns of every researcher in developing countries Publishing Scientific Papers in the Developing World. One hundred young researchers (below the age of 35 and holding a Masters or PhD) will be selected to participate in the event, of which 15% will be NXT alumni from both developed and developing countries to promote networking and to ensure the stability and continuity of the program.  
The event will start on 10 April 2010, and will include various panels and roundtable discussions where the young scientists will be offered the opportunity to meet distinguished scientists, as well as editors and reviewers from several prestigious scientific journals with whom they will share their views regarding the obstacles they face when publishing their research, and explore ways in which they could overcome them. Moreover, each young researcher will demonstrate his/her project/research in the poster session. Furthermore, the young scientists will be invited to participate in the 5-day BioVisionAlexandria Conference program. TWAS will contribute partially to the air tickets. 
Priority will be given to applied research and research meeting society's needs.
 Registration will be closed upon reaching 120 applicants. <b>N.B. Limited places are available.</b><b><a href="http://www.bibalex.org/bva2010/Home/StaticPage.aspx?page=61&amp;m=7" target="_blank">Click this link for more information. </a></b></p>
