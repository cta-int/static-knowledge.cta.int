						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Impacts of climate change on Africa's development and prospects for the continent's growth in a new low-carbon economy are among the subjects covered in a new book by the director of the IIED, Camilla Toulmin.<i> Climate Change in Africa</i> is published by Zed Books and was launched on the 3rd of November at the Royal Commonwealth Society in London, where Toulmin argued that African voices will need to be much louder if the global deal due to be sealed in December in Copenhagen is to serve Africa's interests. The book outlines current thinking and evidence about the impact climate change will have on Africa's development prospects. In this accessible and authoritative book, Dr Toulmin uses case studies to examine issues ranging from natural disasters to biofuels and from conflict to the oil industry. The book considers what future there might be for Africa in a carbon-constrained world, and identifies areas of promise as well as challenge. (Source: AllAfrica, 3 November 2009)</p>

	Farmers in the village of Adi Ha in Tigray, Ethiopia have been offered insurance against the weather in order to reduce their risk from crop failures. Two hundred households are currently involved in the project, which is managed by Oxfam America. Each farmer contributes the equivalent of US$5 a year, and many use the money they receive as part of Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Program, a cash-for-work programme, to pay for their crop insurance. &quot;When farmers are allowed to pay in labour, they can afford a lot more insurance,&quot; said Marjorie Victor, senior policy adviser for Oxfam America. In Adi Ha, the teff crop fails roughly once every five years. Under the insurance scheme, each farmer will get up to US$25 if a pre-determined amount of rain needed to grow teff does not fall by a certain date. This money can then help to buy new seeds, preventing farmers going into dept and falling deeper into poverty. (Source: New Agriculturalist, November 2009)</p>

					<p>United Nations Member States today reached an agreement that sets out the path to financing sustainable forest management, ending nearly two decades of debate on an issue that is becoming more and more critical because of the impact of climate change. The UN Forum on Forests, representing the world’s countries, agreed at a meeting at UN Headquarters in New York to establish two initiatives that it says will particularly help poor countries in need of assistance. An intergovernmental process is being set up to conduct in-depth analysis of all forms of forest financing over the next four years and a separate process will help countries mobilize funding so they can protect their forests. Jan McAlpine, Director of the Secretariat of the UN Forum on Forests, said the new initiatives – the result of negotiations that date back to the landmark Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 – will lead to innovative solutions because they will bring together the broadest possible cross-section, including governments, donors and the private sector.

					<p>Developed countries need urgently to speed up the introduction of environmentally sound technologies to benefit the developing world, an international meeting on climate change and technology transfer has concluded. The two-day meeting, organised by the UN Department for Economic and Social Affairs and India's Ministry of Environment and Forests, ended in New Delhi on the 23rd of October with a statement on global cooperation on climate technology. Emerging nations need climate change technologies to be deployed on a large scale — and the time that elapses between their development and their being used in developing countries should be minimised, the meeting said. The statement is expected to be discussed at the UNFCCC summit in Copenhagen in December. (Source: Scidev.net, 28 October 2009)</p>

					<p>As the clock ticks towards the climate change talks in Copenhagen, Africa has now declared that it will not accept a new pact to replace the Kyoto Protocol. The African negotiators have also stated that they will not accept a merger of the protocol that is currently in use, with a new agreement. In a statement to mark the end of their Second Technical Meeting in Addis Ababa, the negotiators said successful negotiations should produce a two-pronged outcome. They want sections of the Kyoto Protocol on the developed countries to be amended to include further commitments for a second and subsequent commitment periods. Africa also wants a separate legal instrument to be developed based on the outcome of the negotiations of the Bali Action Plan under the Climate Change Convention. The statement reiterated that Africa should be equitably compensated in the context of environmental justice, for environmental resources, economic and social losses considering developed countries historical responsibilities on climate change.

					<p>To raise awareness of the disastrous effects of climate change in the Caribbean, the Ministry of Planning, Housing and the Environment of Trinidad and Tobago has launched a public forum initiative to engage the public in environmental dialogue on how the Government and the population can work to reduce the nation’s levels of green house gases. The government and ministry’s initiative of public forums is part of their move to promote social education, awareness and understanding of how climate change has affected the Caribbean and what is being done locally to prevent further atmospheric deterioration. The forum was attended by students, ministry employees, environmental groups and non-governmental organisations, all of who were invited to ask questions about and make suggestions on the Government’s actions to combat climate change. The focus of the forum is to propel climate change discussions and knowledge and to create a social consciousness of the population’s role in fighting climate change. The Trinidad and Tobago government has produced an environmental policy that will be presented at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting to be held in Port of Spain in November 2009.

					<p>For the first time worldwide, free and ready-to-use high-resolution satellite data is now available to monitor forests and help reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. The monitoring system has been launched by FAO and other partners as part of the Global Forest Resources Assessment. This brings a revolution to the forest monitoring field. Never before have data of this kind been provided directly to users in developing countries. Monitoring will be cheaper, more accurate and transparent for countries that want to participate in reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. The world's forests are in the spotlight as talks for a new climate change deal move towards an agreement on how to achieve reduced emissions from forests next December in Copenhagen, Denmark. A mechanism for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) would be a breakthrough in the fight against climate change and represents one of the areas where most progress is expected in Copenhagen. It is the first time that a global forest scheme has the potential to generate such a magnitude of benefits for developing countries. A REDD mechanism would not only bring a reduced impact on climate but also much needed resources to improve livelihoods, conservation efforts and food security.

					<p>The Leeds University's Faculty of Biological Sciences is calling for the inclusion of biodiversity-friendly strategies in carbon trading schemes to ensure that carbon off-setting projects support, rather than undermine, rainforest conservation. Currently, large plantations of one type of tree, such as Eucalpytus, are popular as carbon off-setting or sequestration projects in the tropics because they also provide commercial benefits, but they do not support tropical biodiversity. A study has shown that managed restoration of logged forest - which can also be used for carbon off-setting - brings biodiversity virtually back to pre-logging levels within 15 years, much quicker than forest left to regenerate naturally. This research shows that it is possible to have both carbon sequestration and biodiversity benefits within the same scheme. (Source: University of Leeds, 20 October 2009)</p>

					<p>Farmers in Benin are implementing their own research findings to boost the soil fertility and moisture retention of their plots. The experiment is part of the project Strengthening the Capacity to Adapt to Climate Change in Rural Benin (PARBCC) - established in late 2007 - which aims to create a three-way conversation between farmers, meteorologists and the government, and help farmers make informed choices about when to sow and harvest crops. One of the long-term goals of the programme is to teach the farming community in Benin to mobilise itself to take action against the effects of climate change. Some 300 farmers are enrolled in sixty “field schools” across the country, working with researchers to help Beninese farmers cope with droughts, tropical storms and other hazards related to climate change. The project's aim is to develop, test and implement farming strategies suited to local conditions. These include mulching, planting pits, adopting integrated crop management and using organic fertilisers. (Source: Scidev.net, 13 October 2009)</p>

					<p>Fish populations in the tropics could fall by as much as 40% over the next half century because of global warming, jeopardising a vital food source for the developing world, a new study published in the Global Change Biology journal has found. The waters off Indonesia - which rank among the most plentiful areas for fish today - could see supplies fall by well over 20% by 2055 because of changes in ocean conditions. Fishermen operating in US coastal waters (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) could also face large declines in fish stocks, as would those working off Chile and China. However, not all regions would be losers. Cooler climates would see their catch potential rise by between 30% and 70% by 2055, with Norway, Greenland, Alaska and the east coast of Russia seeing the biggest increases. While the overall productivity of the world's oceans will remain roughly the same, the sharp declines in fish stocks in Asia, the Caribbean, and semi-enclosed seas like the Mediterranean could cause severe shortfalls in some of the poorest regions of the world.

					<p>As the world wrestles with how to cut greenhouse gas emissions, new technologies are gearing up to grab climate-warming carbon right out of the air. This is different from trapping carbon dioxide as it comes out of pollution sources like factories and power plants. This so-called air capture technology could be set up anywhere and suck carbon directly from the atmosphere. The devices to do this are varied in appearance. Some look a bit like telescopes, others involve vast, thin wall-like structures to capture the carbon. But all aim for a net reduction in atmospheric carbon, instead of just slowing down the increase of greenhouse emissions. Because air capture need not be near carbon-belching factories, it could help the world's poorest countries, which at this point cannot benefit from the global carbon market, in which companies in developed countries get credits for investing in carbon-limiting projects in poor countries.

This was disclosed by director of the Coastal Zone Management Branch at the National Environment and Planning Agency (NEPA). NEPA is working assiduously to mitigate the effects of sea level rise, as continuous rise in sea levels will compound beach erosion and permanently inundate areas along Jamaica's coast. Jamaica is already paying for the effects of climate change. This is amplified by its vulnerability to natural hazards, such as hurricanes and floods. A recent vulnerability assessment of Jamaica's beaches, by NEPA, showed that 95% of the beaches are vulnerable to natural hazards. In a storm, high wave energy often results in severe erosion of the beach and/or shoreline. (Source: Caribbean net news, 30 September 2009)</p>

					<p>The Refugee Studies Centre organised a workshop on environmental change and migration on 8 and 9 January of 2009. Many recent reports on the likely impact of climate change have highlighted the potential for large-scale “environmentally-induced” migrations in developing regions of the world over the next twenty to fifty years. Environmental transformations resulting from increases in global atmospheric temperatures have prompted many experts to predict the collapse of traditional livelihoods systems, increased conflict over natural resources, regional “water wars”, and a resulting population of “environmental refugees” that some have predicted will be hundreds of millions strong. As yet, there is little concrete evidence to justify such predictions. There is a significant lacuna in both conceptual and empirical research on the relationship between environmental change and the patterns and process of migration. For example, it remains unclear how one can differentiate between “environmentally-induced displacement” and other forms of displacement, given the complex mix of factors which underlie people’s decisions to move. This workshop sought to address this lacuna by bringing together academics, activists, policy makers and development practitioners to share research, experience and analysis on the subject.

	The Guyana government and the inter-American Development Bank (IDB) have signed two technical cooperation agreements totalling US $1,450,000 which will see the bank providing support for the Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS) and Guyana’s efforts to improve disaster risk and flood management. One of the agreements which will provide support to the LCDS caters for the strengthening of national institutional capacities for effectively dealing with climate change; and supporting a nation-wide consultation process on the LCDS. The Finance Minister said Guyana has been a global champion for the cause of preserving and protecting rainforests and advocating for the recognition of the contribution that standing forests make in this regard.

					<p>According to a report published by the World Bank, the Bahamas is among the top three most vulnerable Caribbean countries when it comes to climate change. For this reason, Minister of Tourism and Aviation, Senator Vincent Vanderpool-Wallace said initiatives such as Caribiave are vital to mitigate possible environmental impacts. “There is no question that the Caribsave Partnership is of critical importance to the entire Caribbean region,” said Vanderpool-Wallace. “We know that we cannot run away from the issues of sea level rise, salt water intrusions, beach and shore erosion, and the many other impacts of climate change that confront us.” Caribsave is a partnership between the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre (CCCCC) and the University of Oxford, which addresses the impacts and challenges surrounding climate change, tourism, the environment, economic development and the community livelihoods across the Caribbean.

					<p>Small island states that could face devastating storms and floods from climate change urged that global temperature increases be sharply curtailed from goals set recently by industrialized countries. Leaders of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), a group of 42 island countries, said the rest of the world should agree to cut emissions to limit temperature increases well below 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) above pre-industrial levels. Temperatures have already risen about 0.8 degree C from pre-industrial times. &quot;We see climate change as ... a threat to our survival and we have to take the necessary steps to protect our territories, said the prime minister of Grenada. The small island nations of AOSIS, which include the Maldives, Tuvalu and Papua New Guinea, are some of the most vulnerable countries to flooding from rising seas as ice melts from global warming. They are also among the least responsible for emissions blamed for warming the planet. (Source: Reuters, 22 September 2009)</p>

					<p>West African experts and officials adopted a common position on the effects of climate change and human rights ahead of the global UN conference in Copenhagen. Participants at a two-meeting in Lome came up with a declaration on the challenges related to climate change in west Africa, approved by ministers responsible for environment and human rights in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), a statement said. The conference was the first in the region to examine the link between climate change and human rights. (Source: Republic of Togo, 17 September 2009)</p>
