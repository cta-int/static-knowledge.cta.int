						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>This policy brief, prepared by the Oceanic and Coastal Fisheries Programmes of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, highlights the importance of fisheries to the people of the Pacific Islands, alerts Pacific Island governments and their development partners to the effects of climate change and ocean acidification on the contributions of fisheries to their economies and communities. The policy brief highlights practical adaptations and supporting policies that are available to help minimise the risks and capitalise on possible opportunities. Suggestions on policies for practical adaptation include: developing and maintaining economic partnership agreements with the European Union; diversify sources of tuna for canneries; full implementation of the vessel day scheme (VDS) for managing tuna; developing service industries for industrial fishing and fish cargo vessels; energy efficiency programmes for industrial fleets; and increasing access to tuna and by-catch for food security. &nbsp;&nbsp;(SPC, 05/2014)</p>

					<p>Andrew Leakey, plant biology professor at the University of Illinois, US, and colleagues report that levels of zinc, iron and protein drop in some key crop plants when grown at elevated CO2 levels. The teams simulated high CO2 levels in open-air fields using a system called Free Air Concentration Enrichment (FACE), which pumps out, monitors and adjusts ground-level atmospheric CO2 to simulate future conditions. The experiments revealed that the nutritional quality of a number of the world’s most important plants dropped in response to elevated CO2. Zinc and iron went down significantly in wheat, rice, field peas and soybeans. Wheat and rice also saw notable declines in protein content at higher CO2. Nutrients in millet, sorghum and maize remained relatively stable at higher CO2 levels because these crops use a type of photosynthesis, called C4, which already concentrates carbon dioxide in their leaves. &nbsp; &nbsp;(<a href="http://news.illinois.edu/news/14/0507CO2_AndrewLeakey.html" target="_self">University of Illinois</a>, 07/05/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>A study published in <i>Global Change Biology</i> by Christoph Müller and colleagues of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), Germany, presents a map of hotspots of climate change impacts in Africa to help guide regional food security interventions. The researchers explored the spread of climate change impact projections and develop a composite impact measure to identify hotspots of climate change impacts, addressing likelihood and strength of impacts. They found that overlapping impacts in different biosphere properties (e.g. flooding, yields) will not only claim additional capacity to respond, but will also narrow the options to respond and develop. However, each hotspot must be evaluated case-by-case, the authors argue, and a continental scenario analysis like this one is not a blueprint for adaptation: only with local expertise can such a tool help to decide where to best put the limited resources allocated to climate adaptation. &nbsp; &nbsp;(<a href="http://www.pik-potsdam.de/news/press-releases/hotspots-of-climate-change-impacts-in-africa-making-sense-of-uncertainties" target="_self">PIK</a>, 06/05/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>To trace the dynamics around agricultural drought in the United States, Qiusheng Wu, a doctoral student and research assistant and Hongxing Liu, professor, both at the Department of Geography, University of Cincinnati, US, implemented an Event-based Spatial-Temporal Data Model (ESTDM) to detect, track and monitor drought conditions. The framework organised data into objects, sequences, processes and events. The data was collected from the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite, which was the first of its kind dedicated to measure moisture near the surface of the soil. The researchers examined patterns of spreading drought to develop predictions for future drought events. The prediction tool is now being prepared to use data from NASA's soon-to-be-launched Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

					<p>Working with national partners in Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia, WorldFish, the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and the University of Osnabruck (Germany) have released the results of an analysis of climate change adaptation in food production in the Chinyanja Triangle in southern Africa. The project has identified a number of shifts in agricultural practices in response to climate-related changes. As weather becomes less predictable, local communities have embraced fish farming and small-scale irrigation. In response to reduced rainfall, farmers are increasing water storage and do not drain their ponds for longer periods of time. Communities endowed with a surplus of land have also begun to trade with communities with more water resources. While these changes have helped mitigate some of the effects of climate change, the researchers found that increases in irrigation and aquaculture are straining local water supplies. The project recommends that farmers plant trees along the rivers to increase shade cover, decrease evaporation, and reduce erosion. Other best practices include: distancing crops from the streams' banks to decrease siltation; creating ridges to slow run-off; and planting crops earlier to make use of residual moisture. &nbsp; &nbsp;(<a href="http://land-l.iisd.org/news/worldfish-iwmi-release-research-on-agricultural-water-use-and-adaptation-in-africa/ " target="_self">IISD</a>, 04/2014) &nbsp;</p>

					<p>The IPCC published its Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) on 31 March 2014. The Panel’s scientists have revised estimates, pointing to significant losses with a temperature rise of just two degrees Celsius in food producing regions. In previous reports, only a rise by three to four degrees Celsius was thought to have a significant impact on agricultural production. The changes in scientists’ estimates of how climate change will affect agriculture are some of the most remarkable in the report. AR5, looking at the major food crops of corn, wheat, and rice, says that yields are likely to start decreasing by 2030 and decline up to 2% a decade (climate change seems to be affecting crops already, but so far this has been offset by improvements in crop yield). Sections of the report relevant to agriculture can be found under the section &quot;Global and sectoral aspects&quot; and there is a special chapter (Chapter 7) on food security and food production systems. &nbsp;&nbsp;The UN-IPCC report: <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/index.shtml" target="_self">https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/index.shtml</a>. &nbsp;Global and sectoral aspects: <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/" target="_self">https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/</a>. &nbsp;Food security and food production systems: <a href="http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-Chap7_FGDall.pdf" target="_self">http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-Chap7_FGDall.pdf</a>. &nbsp;(IPCC, 31/03/2014)</p>

					<p>Jami Dixon and colleagues at the School of Earth and Environment (University of Leeds, UK) investigate how historical (climatic, economic) trends have influenced farming system adaptive capacity in Uganda. By comparing two farming systems, they note three major findings: (1) similar trends in farming system evolution have had different impacts on the diversity of farming systems; (2) trends have contributed to the erosion of informal social and cultural institutions and an increasing dependence on formal institutions; and (3) trade-offs between components of adaptive capacity are made at the farm-scale, thus influencing farming system adaptive capacity. To identify the actual impacts of future climate change and variability, the authors highlight the importance to recognise the dynamic nature of adaptation. In practice, areas identified for further adaptation support include: shift away from one-size-fits-all approach the identification and integration of appropriate modern farming method; a greater focus on building inclusive formal and informal institutions; and a more nuanced understanding regarding the roles and decision-making processes of influential, but external, actors. More research is needed to understand farm-scale trade-offs and the resulting impacts across spatial and temporal scales. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2079-9276/3/1/182" target="_self">http://www.mdpi.com/2079-9276/3/1/182</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Resources</i>, 27/02/2014)</p>

					<p>New research of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), Austria shows that the projected transition of livestock systems from pure grazing diets to diets supplemented by higher quality feeds will cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by as much as 23% by 2030. While the reduction of meat in the diets is often seen as a way to reduce GHG emissions, the paper explains that farmers would find it more profitable in coming years to expand livestock production in mixed systems – where livestock are fed on both grass as well as higher quality feed –rather than in pure grass-based systems. Such a development would lead to a 23% reduction of emissions from land use change in the next two decades without any explicit climate mitigation policy. This new study projects that the increasing cost of land and continued yield increases in the crop sector will lead to shifts to richer animal diets in the future. Such diets are efficient not only from the perspective of greenhouse gas reduction, but also from farm profit maximization and food production. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/news/20140225-PNAS.html" target="_self">http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/news/20140225-PNAS.html</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(IIASA, 25/02/2014)</p>

					<p>Ly Mouhamed and colleagues of the AGRHYMET Regional Center in Niger, have analysed the evolution of some extreme temperature and precipitation indices over a large area of West Africa. Using daily observations of rainfall and temperature available at the AGRHYMET Regional Center for the 1960–2010 period, they identified a general warming trend throughout the region during that period, namely through a negative trend in the number of cool nights, and more frequent warm days and warm spells. This was the case not only for locations inside the continent, but also for those in coastal areas. Trends in rainfall related indices are not as uniform as the ones in temperatures. Nevertheless, a general tendency of decreased annual total rainfall and maximum number of consecutive wet days characterises the study period. Policy implications of these trends may include investment and promotion of low cost and environmentally friendly energy production systems, the redesign of infrastructure and production systems to account for higher risks of losses due to floods and/or droughts, and the promotion of research for more heat tolerant crop/animal species and cultivars/breeds. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094713000066" target="_self">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094713000066</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>Weather and Climate Extremes</i>, 25/08/2013)</p>

					<p>The International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD, Canada), along with Uganda's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives (MoTIC), Makerere University (MAK), and the Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN) worked together during a six-month period in 2013 to provide a platform for dialogue on climate risk management among actors along the coffee value chain. The study found that climate hazards such as droughts, floods and changing rainfall patterns already negatively affect all actors along the coffee value chain, but in different ways and to different extents. Results also showed that coffee farmers and processors generally tend to be more vulnerable to climate hazards than traders, middlemen and exporters, due to their limited diversification, weak organisational capacities and the unfavourable policy environment. As a result of this pilot initiative, for the first time in Uganda, climate risks were integrated into trade-related issues at the ministerial level.

					<p>This article by Ola T. Westengen and Anne K Brysting from the University of Oslo, Norway, present a case study of the role of genetic resources and seed systems in adapting to climatic stress from in semi-arid agro-ecological zone of Tanzania. In this case, crop adaptation involves the adoption of improved maize varieties combined with continued use of local varieties of both maize and sorghum. Analysis shows that households receiving extension service and owning livestock are more likely to switch to drought-tolerant varieties as a response to climatic stress than those without these assets. The seed system in the study area consists of both formal and informal elements. The informal channels supply the highest quantities of both sorghum and maize seeds. Recycling of improved varieties of maize is common and the majority of households practice seed selection. Detailed assessment of the three different categories of genetic resources – local, improved and farmer-recycled varieties – reveals that drought tolerance is more frequently reported as a reason for growing local varieties than for growing improved varieties of maize and sorghum. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.agricultureandfoodsecurity.com/content/3/1/3/abstract" target="_self">http://www.agricultureandfoodsecurity.com/content/3/1/3/abstract</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Agriculture and Food Security</i>, 01/02/2014)</p>

Some new features have also been added. For instance, as before the user can pick any point on the earth’s surface and generate daily weather data for that point. Now, the user can also plot climate data, in terms of the monthly mean values of rainfall and daily maximum and minimum temperature. In addition, MarkSim GCM can be used to generate daily data that are to some extent characteristic of future climates. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://ccafs.cgiar.org/blog/new-updates-marksimgcm-weather-generator#.UvJUO7Qp_jI" target="_self">http://ccafs.cgiar.org/blog/new-updates-marksimgcm-weather-generator#.UvJUO7Qp_jI</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(CGIAR CCAFS, 27/01/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>David Filiberto at Cornell University and John Gaunt&nbsp; of Carbon Consulting,&nbsp; Ithaca, USA explain why the need for further clarity on optimising biochar (charcoal) application to various crop yields is necessary if it is to gain widespread acceptance as a soil amendment. Biochar may be added to soils with the intention to improve the soil, displace an amount of conventional fossil fuel based fertilisers, and sequester carbon. However, the economics of biochar use as a soil conditioning amendment are challenging. The authors suggest that further research is needed to determine the optimal biochar application rate. They believe that strategies focused on high value crops that require high levels of fertiliser application may prove more fruitful in sustaining the economic viability of the technique. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/3/4/715" target="_self">http://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/3/4/715</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Agriculture</i>, 17/10/2013)</p>

					<p>This news report by IPS shows how drastic changes in the weather of Trinidad and Tobago affect root crops, and how the farmers who grow them, are suffering from delayed and scarce but heavier rain. Root crops under these weather conditions grow more slowly but fields of cowpea are destroyed. While hindering the development of winged insect pest, the changes in rain intensity render pesticide application almost useless. Even more worrying is the proliferation of fungus and bacteria. Solutions exist though: better soil management offers a quick fix, but on the longer term, the region must do better to collect, preserve and improve the local germplasm so as to develop deter adapted crops. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/09/trinidads-farmers-outpaced-by-climate-change/" target="_self">http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/09/trinidads-farmers-outpaced-by-climate-change/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(IPS, 23/09/2013)</p>

					<p>A new study has revealed that global warming is resulting in the spread of crop pests towards the North and South Poles at a rate of nearly 3 km a year. The study, &nbsp;published in the journal Nature Climate Change and carried out by researchers at the University of Exeter and the University of Oxford, shows a strong relationship &nbsp;between increased global temperatures over the past 50 years and expansion in the range of crop pests. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-09/uoe-soc082913.php" target="_self">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-09/uoe-soc082913.php</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(EurekAlert, 01/09/2013)</p>

					<p>The damage scientists expect climate change to do to crop yields can differ greatly depending on which type of model was used to make those projections, &nbsp;according to research based at Princeton University. Empirical models are built by finding the relationship between observed crop yields and historical environmental &nbsp;conditions, while mechanistic models are built on the physiological understanding of how the plant grows and reproduces in response to a range of conditions. &nbsp;Empirical models are simpler and require fewer inputs, are a staple in studying the possible effects of climate change on ecological systems where the data and &nbsp;knowledge about most species are largely unavailable. Mechanistic models are more common in studying agriculture because there is a much greater wealth of data &nbsp;and knowledge that have accumulated over several thousand years of agricultural development. Using both model classes lets researchers identify each class' &nbsp;biases and correct for it. Each model has different strengths and weaknesses that can be complementary when combined. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130814144811.htm" target="_self">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130814144811.htm</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Science Daily, 14/08/2013) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Research by scientists at The University of Manchester and Lancaster shows maintaining healthy soil biodiversity can play an important role in optimising land &nbsp;management programmes in the face of climate change. The study shows that there is a strong link between soil organisms and the overall functioning of &nbsp;ecosystems. This is the first time researchers have looked at the entire community of organisms in the soil and the associated dynamics in liberating nitrogen for &nbsp;plant growth and locking up carbon. The findings will help in predicting how land use and climate change will impact on ecosystems and looking at ways to minimise &nbsp;negative changes. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://phys.org/news/2013-08-soil-biodiversity-crucial-future-response.html" target="_self">http://phys.org/news/2013-08-soil-biodiversity-crucial-future-response.html</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(Phys.org, 12/08/2013) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Secondary schools throughout the regions will receive copies of Eco-ribbean.Trailer teaser&nbsp; - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/sRO6xKpu74c?autoplay=1" target="_blank"> http://www.youtube.com/v/sRO6xKpu74c?autoplay=1&nbsp; </a>﻿﻿Check out <a href="http://www.niherst.gov.tt/publications/eco-ribbean/index.htm" target="_blank">http://www.niherst.gov.tt/publications/eco-ribbean/index.htm &nbsp; &nbsp;</a> &nbsp;Working with the Global Water Partnership-Caribbean and the Toco Foundation, in October 2011, NIHERST embarked on a project to develop more sustainable communities. The initial focus is <b>rainwater harvesting systems</b> (RWHS) in water-scarce communities combined with solar energy solutions. Since the first installation of the RWHS at the Rochard Douglas Presbyterian Primary School in July 2012, harvesters were installed at schools in Toco and Moruga. The rainwater harvesters have proved to be very beneficial to the schools which have experienced water shortages, particularly in the dry season. The additional water supply has helped to decrease the amount of down-time created by the closure of school due to the lack of water. Now the RWHS provide water to flush toilets and wash hands thus improving on school sanitation and eliminating the offensive odour of toilets. The Rochard Douglas Presbyterian Primary School has estimated that the RWHS has cut its need for truck-borne water by half.
