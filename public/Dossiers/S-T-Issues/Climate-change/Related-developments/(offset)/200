						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>The international community has shown keen interest in Guyana’s efforts to combat climate change which is encompassed in the draft Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS). Consultations on the Strategy were launched on June 8, 2009 and President Bharrat Jagdeo highlighted the international partners who have shown their support and encouragement. In particular, Guyana has been working closely with Norway to determine how to generate performance-based compensation for forest climate services which will support the implementation of the LCDS. Also, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy has promised to include the issue of deforestation in the agenda of the upcoming G-8 meeting and Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton of the United States has pointed out that addressing forestry can also help accelerate a greater global understanding of the need for action on the broader climate change agenda. These partnerships’ intention is to support the creation of low-carbon employment and investment opportunities in Guyana; sustained efforts to avoid deforestation and forest degradation; strengthening transparent forest governance; and establishing an international monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) system for Guyana’s forests.

					<p>Climate change has contributed to a flattening of the complex, multi-layered architecture of Caribbean coral reefs, compromising their role as a nursery for fish stocks and a buffer against tropical storms, <a href="http://www.dulvy.com/publications/forthcoming/Alvarez_2009_PRSLB_proof.pdf" target="_blank">a study</a> on <a href="http://www.dulvy.com/publications/forthcoming/Alvarez_2009_PRSLB_proof.pdf" target="_blank">“Flattening of Caribbean coral reefs: region-wide declines in architectural complexity”</a> shows. The analysis of 500 surveys of 200 reefs, conducted between 1969 and 2008, showed the most complex types of reef had been virtually wiped out across the entire Caribbean. &quot;We suggest that the last period of decline is partly due to climate change, but also due to several other human impacts such as over-fishing and coastal development,&quot; Alvarez said. &quot;In future, we'll need to change our behavior and reduce the stress on the reefs.&quot; (Source: Caribbean Net News, 11June 2009)</p>

					<p>Farmers in Africa are helping to identify alternative farming techniques which will help them adapt to climate change. This participatory research is being conducted as part of the <a href="http://www.idrc.ca/ccaa/" target="_blank">Climate Change Adaptation in Africa programme</a> which is jointly funded by the UK's Department for International Development (DFID) and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC). The study, initiated in 2007, is working with smallholder farmers in Uganda, Tanzania, Ghana, Mali, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe. These countries represent a range of different climatic zones within Africa. As part of the study, learning centres have been established in each country where researchers, extension workers and suppliers of agricultural inputs, such as seeds and fertilizers, work together with farmers to identify which interventions would help to minimise vulnerability to climate change. The learning centres combine the use of local and traditional knowledge with new knowledge to test alternative farming practices such as using different crops and crop varieties, and various methods of improving soil fertility. Declining soil fertility was identified as a major challenge across all study sites, and is a major constraint to the efficient use of available water by crops. (Source: Leisa)</p>

					<p>
The Bonn Climate Change Talks took place from 1 till 12 June 2009 in Maritim, Bonn. Delegates from 182 countries met in Bonn to discuss, for the first time, key negotiating texts which can serve as the basis for an ambitious and effective international climate change deal, to be clinched in Copenhagen in December.The main focus in Bonn was to enhance international climate change cooperation, including in the post-2012 period when the first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol expires. The long-term issues were considered by the <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/items/4381.php" target="_blank">AWG-LCA</a> and <a href="http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/4577.php" target="_blank">AWG-KP</a> working groups, which are both scheduled to conclude their work by the 15th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15), to be held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December 2009. At the conclusion of the meetings, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer stated that an ambitious and effective agreed outcome in Copenhagen “is in sight,” highlighting that governments had made clearer what they want to see in this agreed outcome. He also called for an increase “in the level of ambition” regarding the emission reduction targets discussed by the AWG-KP, warning that the negotiating group was still far from the range set out by science to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.Visit the <a href="http://www.iisd.ca/climate/sb30/" target="_blank">IISD website</a> for the daily web coverage.</p>

					<p>Saying that vulnerable fishing and coastal communities around the world will bear the brunt of climate change's impacts, a group of 16 international organizations have urged climate negotiators to ensure that fisheries and aquaculture are not neglected in ongoing discussions regarding a successor to the Kyoto Protocol. In a <a href="ftp://ftp.fao.org/FI/brochure/climate_change/policy_brief.pdf" target="_blank">policy brief</a> issued on the first of June 2009 in advance of UNFCC talks held from 1 to 12 June 2009 in Bonn, Germany, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the World Bank, the WorldFish Center and 11 other organizations warned that millions of fishers, fish farmers and coastal inhabitants will experience less stable livelihoods, changes in the availability and quality of fish for food, and heightened risks to their health, safety and homes as a result of climate change. Research is required to understand the complex biological and chemical processes of aquatic ecosystems. Equally important is understanding how people adapt to living in a changing climate and how their institutions and livelihoods have evolved, and can further evolve, to maintain resilience in the face of future change.

In its <a href="http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/11427/a/126363" target="_blank">report on climate change and development</a> presented to the United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday,CCCD wants priority to be given to the most vulnerable countries – African and small island states in particular by supporting existing National Adaptation Programs of Action as entry points to long term integrated plans and strategies. Most importantly, climate change actions, development planning and disaster risk reduction must come together. This requires that they are led from the highest political and organizational level.

	Villagers in Kenya are the latest participants in a project to calculate how much carbon can be stored in trees and soils when the land is managed in sustainable, climate-friendly ways. The <a href="http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=585&amp;ArticleID=6159&amp;l=en " target="_blank">Carbon Benefits Project</a> has been launched in communities in and around Lake Victoria by UNEP, the World Agroforestry Centre, and other key partners. Funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the project is already under way in Niger, Nigeria and China, where scientists are developing a system for measuring, monitoring and managing carbon in a diverse range of landscapes. Under the UN Climate Change Convention and its Kyoto Protocol, developed countries can offset some of their greenhouse gas emissions by paying developing economies for implementing clean and renewable energy projects such as wind, solar and geothermal power.

In a workshop which was held in Mombasa, the experts were categorical that climate change comes with either a ‘package’ of advantages, or one of disadvantages, and that it is important for countries to explore the advantages and make opportunities out of them. The workshop had a purpose of identifying strategies that can work between government, international support agencies and non-governmental organisations in order to enhance resilience, by strengthening public institutions, civil society and community based organisations.

					<p>By 2015 the Carteret islands - off the coast of Papua New Guinea - could well be a mirage. The low lying atoll is sinking and sinking fast as the ocean is rising. Salt water has eaten up the shoreline and invaded the gardens. For many, it’s time to pack up and go, but without help from the government, hundreds are stuck on this sinking atoll. Paul Tsube is one of the few who managed to leave early. He didn’t wait for government assistance to migrate. Scientists are still debating why the atoll is sinking. Paul Tsube blames global warming and the developed world for what’s happened to his island. “And I think that something has to be done by the industrialised nations so we can get some sort of assistance from them.” (Source: France24, 15 March 2009)</p>

					<p>The impacts of climate change are falling disproportionately on poor communities, in poor countries. It is vital that these communities are able to adapt to these new or enhanced climatic stresses, but current financial and technical assistance is all too often failing to reach the most vulnerable and marginalized. Community-Based Adaptation (CBA) is an innovative approach that focuses on enabling communities to enhance their own adaptive capacity, and empowering vulnerable communities to increase their own resilience to the impacts of climate change. CBA identifies, assists and implements community-based adaptation activities, research and policy, in regions where adaptive capacity is as dependent on livelihoods as climatic changes. CBA-X is a shared online resource designed to bring together and grow the CBA community. It provides a site for the exchange of up-to-date information about community-based adaptation, including news, events, case-studies, tools, policy resources, and videos.

In January 2000 the low-lying boomerang-shaped atoll nation of Tuvalu was one of the first to witness the dawn of the new millennium, and news reports all over the world carried iconic footage of a conch-blower heralding the new era on an island that will not exist by the end of the next century, let alone the next millennium. In this context Nichol Nonga, animal production officer for the Secretariat for the Pacific Community (SPC), feels that national governments in the region are not giving conservation of animal genetic resources enough attention. We need to extend the inventory and characterisation work to other countries, conserve breeds and establish institutions to do this, he urges. (Source: New Agriculturist, February 2009)</p>

The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is the United Nations systems designated entity for addressing environmental issues at the global and regional level. Its mandate is to coordinate the development of environmental policy consensus by keeping the global environment under review and bringing emerging issues to the attention of governments and the international community for action. UNEP’s Division of Technology, Industry and Economics (DTIE) works with international and non-governmental organizations, national and local governments, business and industry to develop and implement policies, strategies and practices that are cleaner and safer, incorporate environmental costs, use natural resources efficiently, reduce pollution and risks for humans and the environment, and enable the implementation of conventions and international agreements. The position is within the Energy Branch’s Technology Transfer Unit, which contributes to the organization’s climate change programme by promoting the deployment and finance of energy efficient and low greenhouse gas technologies in developing countries. Closing date: 13 Mar 2009. To apply go to the <a href="http://www.unep.org/vacancies" target="_blank">UNEP website</a> (see Project Positions) </p>

					<p><b>Which areas in Africa are most vulnerable to climate change?</b>By P., K. Thornton; P., G. Jones; T. Owiyo, African Association of Agricultural Economists, March 2008. Climate change and increasing climate variability threaten the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Some of the worst effects on human health and agriculture will be in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in vulnerable regions. However, despite the magnitude of the changes likely, the intersection of climate change, crop production and livestock keeping in sub-Saharan Africa is a neglected area of research. This paper aims to fill this research gap. It uses a broad-brush analysis at the continental level to identify areas or “hotspots” that are already vulnerable and likely to suffer substantial impacts as a result of climate change. </p>
