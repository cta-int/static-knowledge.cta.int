						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	The Copenhagen Conference on Climate Change was no gift to small islands and countries with low lying coastlands. From the Caribbean, Camillo Gonsalves, St Vincent &amp; the Grenadines Ambassador to the United Nations was particularly scathing. He is reported by the Caribbean Media Corporation as saying: “St Vincent and the Grenadines feels no less threatened today than we did when Copenhagen began”. He expressed the hope that the next climate change conference, scheduled for Mexico later this year, will be marked by “openness, inclusivity, transparency and legitimacy.” One Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM) country can claim some success at Copenhagen. Guyana has adopted a strategy of preserving its forests so as to contain greenhouse gas emissions in return for development money. A plan, excluded from the Kyoto Protocol entitled Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) — under which wealthier nations pay rainforest countries for preserving their trees, was specifically mentioned in the political accord.

					<p>Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Patrick Manning said The United Nations Climate Change recent meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark did not create the impact as he had hoped it would but was not a failure. Manning, who was among other Caribbean leaders at the conference, said it was successful in achieving an agreement between the major carbon emission offenders and big victims.

					<p>Already under threat from over-fishing, habitat loss and weak management, fisheries and aquaculture are in a poor position to cope with the effects of climate change. Rising sea temperatures are predicted to drive most marine species towards the poles - increasing the populations of warmer-water species and decreasing populations of colder-water species. For example, fish adapted to narrow temperature ranges, such as Atlantic salmon, &quot;may be extirpated from their present habitats because of the combined impacts of warming, changing habitats, introduced competitors and predators and increased parasitism,&quot; the study found.

					<p>Even as farmers in Africa try to lessen the impact of climate change by growing green fuel crops like Jatropha, the technology required to process these seeds into economically viable products is lacking and debate on how to transfer it from the West is one of the contentious issues at the ongoing Copenhagen climate talks. African delegates say technology transfer from developed countries to developing countries, should be fast tracked. The transfer involves for example helping African countries set up solar panel assembling and manufacturing plants, but the developed countries say this is not possible because of intellectual property rights of that technology need to be protected. A 10-country Africa delegation here in Copenhagen led by South Africa said it would base their argument for unrestricted technology transfer on the fact that developed economies are the major polluters of the environment and that their indiscriminate industrial activities caused the massive carbon emission that resulted in climate change.

					<p>Livestock researchers believe that rather than rid the world of livestock it’s preferable to find ways to farm animals more efficiently, profitably and sustainably, according to a new short film (see article) prepared by the ILRI on livestock and climate change. “Looking at the livestock emissions as a whole, if you aggregate that into one, you are missing a big difference between developing and developed countries,” says ILRI director general Carlos Sere in the film. “In developed economies, which mainly have a commercial livestock sector, we can apply a range of policies and instruments to reduce emissions. Reducing livestock-related greenhouse gas emissions in poor countries is possible, but we need to be aware of the stark trade-offs. We might end up with many more poor people and hungry children.”(Source: CGIAR, December 9, 2009)</p>

					<p>For generations, the Nganyi people of western Kenya have served as rainmakers, helping local communities decide when best to prepare their land and sow their seeds. By observing subtle changes in nature that would be unnoticeable to most people - in air currents, the flowering and shedding of leaves of certain trees, the behaviour of ants, bird songs, even the croaking of frogs and toads - they have been able to interpret weather patterns and provide valuable advice. A British-Canadian project aims to combine indigenous knowledge with modern science to build up climate change intelligence and disseminate it more widely in a community whose existence depends almost exclusively on farming. The full story, <i>If the weatherman says it's raining...</i>, which includes a photodocumentary, can be found on the DFID website (http://www.dfid.gov.uk/rainmakers). The project, launched last year, is led by the IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC), with support from the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) - DFID Climate Change Adaptation in Africa programme (<a href="http://www.idrc.ca/ccaa/" target="_self">http://www.idrc.ca/ccaa/</a>).

	Trinidad and Tobago’s climate change policy will focus on this country’s emissions in the context of global reduction, according to Minister of Planning, Housing and the Environment Emily Dick-Forde. The climate change policy was built on the National Environmental Policy, and will focus on mitigation and adaptation issues. “We are in the process of developing a low-carbon strategy and this is going to focus on the transportation and the manufacturing sector.” Dick-Forde said there were several strategies, but using compressed natural gas was one which gives you very low emissions. Another approach will be properly-maintained vehicles and incentives to focus on people using their vehicles less; so that is why you have mass transportation. One of the biggest concerns regarding climate change in Trinidad and Tobago is its impact on agriculture. Dick-Forde said other adaptation strategies included proper irrigation systems to address flooding and better water-distribution systems to deal with low water supply.

The fund, proposed by UK and French leaders at the Commonwealth summit at the end of November, would start next year and build to $10bn annually by 2012. Many Commonwealth members are island states threatened by rising sea levels. Leaders also called for the strongest possible outcome at next month's climate change summit in Copenhagen. They unanimously agreed to seek a legally binding international agreement, but accepted that &quot;a full legally binding outcome&quot; might have to wait to 2010. The first cash would be made available next year, before any emissions deal could take effect. (Source: BBC news, 29 November 2009)</p>

	Rising sea levels, ocean warming, cyclones and droughts caused by climate change is set to hit hard food security in the Pacific islands, the FAO said, urging governments to take immediate actions. Climate change is expected to act as a &quot;threat multiplier&quot; in the Pacific region, home to 14 Pacific island countries and five territories (PICT), the FAO said in a special report issued ahead of U.N. climate change talks in Copenhagen coming December. Despite the fact that PICTs make negligible contributions to global greenhouse gas emissions rates (0.03 percent), they find themselves -- unfairly -- facing the frontline of climate change impacts. The region which relies on imported fuel and food and is susceptible to natural disasters, faces more frequent tropical cyclones and droughts, degradation of land and marine ecosystems and rising risks to local food production. The region's vital fishing industry was under pressure from climate-triggered changes and the forests which provide important staple crops in the region, such as breadfruit, mangoes, citrus fruits and coconuts, are also threatened by climate change and overexploitation.

					<p>Climate has been a major driver of armed conflict in Africa, research shows - and future warming is likely to increase the number of deaths from war. US researchers found that across the continent, conflict was about 50% more likely in unusually warm years. Writing in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , they suggest strife arises when the food supply is scarce in warm conditions. Climatic factors have been cited as a reason for several recent conflicts. One is the fighting in Darfur in Sudan that according to UN figures has killed 200,000 people and forced two million more from their homes. Previous research has shown an association between lack of rain and conflict, but this is thought to be the first clear evidence of a temperature link. The researchers used databases of temperatures across sub-Saharan Africa for the period between 1981 and 2002, and looked for correlations between above average warmth and civil conflict in the same country that left at least 1,000 people dead. Warm years increased the likelihood of conflict by about 50% - and food seems to be the reason why. (Source: BBC news, 24 November 2009)</p>

					<p>More than 60 prominent agricultural scientists and leaders have decried the almost total absence of agriculture in the climate talks, warning that the climate deal to be reached next month could lead to widespread famine and food shortages in the years ahead. Signatories of a statement issued at the weekend in Rome, Italy, by leading thinkers in development include five World Food Prize laureates, former heads of development agencies, former Ministers of Agriculture, and heads of the world’s leading alliance of agricultural research centres. Alarmed by a substantial oversight in the global climate talks leading up to the UNCCC in Copenhagen next month, the leaders said: “No credible or effective agreement to address the challenges of climate change can ignore agriculture and the need for crop adaptation to ensure the world’s future food supplies.” Farmers will encounter problems they have never before experienced: much greater weather variability, higher average temperatures, increased numbers of extremely hot days, shorter growing seasons, higher solar radiation, much greater moisture stress, added salinity from salt water incursion and irrigation systems, and new combinations of pests and diseases. The group called on negotiators to recognize the importance of crop diversity conservation and use as an essential element in the commitments they will make for climate change adaptation.

					<p>Adding organic carbon to the soil in the form of biochar is being put forward as one means of countering the effects of climate change. A team of research scientitsts at Edinburgh University is attempting to measure the environmental benefits of this type of charcoal and assess its potential as an enhancer of soil fertility. One of the researchers, Dr Saran Sohi, explained that most naturally-occurring carbon in the soil is lost into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide when cultivation takes place. Soils contain over three times more carbon than the atmosphere and nearly five times more than plants and animals produce. They represent a significant source of greenhouse gases, but they also have the potential to store carbon if the right management is applied. If biochar is incorporated into farmland, it can increase the soil’s carbon content permanently and would establish a carbon store for atmospheric carbon dioxide, while increasing and maintaining soil fertility.

					<p>The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) secretariat has launched a campaign to promote the region’s collective position on climate change leading up to the UNFCCC meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, coming December. The campaign under the theme “1.5 °C to Stay Alive”, was launched mid November and intends to support and dramatize a common regional approach for mitigating the effects of climate change on the region, which will be articulated at Copenhagen as well as at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference, November 27-29, 2009, Trinidad and Tobago. According to CARICOM, the plan includes a digital display on the harmful effects of rising greenhouse gases on the small island states and several video presentations on the how climate change is affecting human, animal and plant life in the Caribbean. CARICOM Secretary-General Edwin Carrington said the common regional approach for mitigation of climate change to avoid “its unmanageable consequences” was based on studies by the CARICOM Climate Change Centre. He stated that the Region would seek to consolidate its position within the Alliance of Small Island Developing States, the Group of 77 and China, as well as with the Developed or Annex 1 Countries.

					<p>East Africa will face both crop gains and losses as a result of climate change, but food security is an achievable goal if new farming technologies are embraced, says a study published in <i>Agricultural Systems</i> in November 2009. It predicts that yields of staples like maize and beans will double in the region's highland areas as a result of rising temperatures, as warmer climates make crops mature faster. But the reverse is likely to occur in both drier and more humid areas, with crop harvests decreasing significantly in these places. Four areas projected to have &quot;statistically significant&quot; yield reductions of 20 per cent or more by 2050 are coastal Kenya, northeast and northwest Tanzania and central Uganda. Only by adapting its agricultural systems will the region be able to absorb the impacts of climate change, says Carlos Seré, director-general of the ILRI in Kenya.

					<p>Disease and pests have become a major problem on Mahe, Seychelles' main island. Once cool, trade winds are now warmer, fostering the right breeding grounds for disease. The change in temperature and unusual, extreme seasons have made farming even more unforgiving, said a local farmer, noting that his neighbor recently had to burn thousands of dollars worth of Chinese cabbage after they became infected. Climate change is making it more difficult for Seychelles to achieve food security. To make matters even more challenging, roughly 70 percent of Seychelles' agricultural land lies along the coast. Farmers are complaining that their land is being inundated by a number of tidal surges and their freshwater sources are mixing with saltwater. The most Seychelles can do is adapt, to carry out projects that keep the seawater out of farmland or that prevent coastal erosion. But the tiny African nation, with a population of less than 85,000 people, is one of the most indebted countries in the world. Without foreign assistance, adjusting to climate change will be virtually impossible. The Seychelles government recently released a statement expressing its concern at attempts to steamroll the world's most vulnerable countries into accepting a watered down political agreement.

	Last week, at the opening of the first International Biodiversity Conference for Sustainable Development in Papua, the governor of Papua re-affirmed his pledge to address climate change and sustainability in this province. The governor articulated five key aspirations. The first three relate to sustainable forest and land use management: halting 50 percent of allocated conversion forests and preserving these under sustainable forest management; not allowing the use of primary forests with high conservation values for oil palm and other land uses; and increasing the efficiency and productivity of current land use, including existing oil palm. The other two messages consist in promoting and developing renewable energy based industries to gradually reduce dependence on fossil fuels; and promoting local natural resource sectors and small-medium enterprises as engines for rural development.

	Scientists working on the EU-funded CARBOOCEAN (“Marine carbon sources and sinks assessment”) project have reiterated calls for a greater reduction of man-made CO2 emissions. Current targets are not strict enough, they argue, as contrary to popular belief, their findings show how the regional carbon sinks in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean that take up more CO2 than they release are not stable and have decreased in nearly a decade. Higher atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations will accelerate ocean acidification and diminish the effectiveness of marine carbon sink areas. The CARBOOCEAN project, supported under the 'Sustainable development, global change and ecosystems' Thematic area of the EU's FP6, reveals that finding and quantifying the CO2 in the oceans, and understanding how it got there is key. The project finds that overestimating the ocean's ability to act as a sink can be vital when policy is under development. In the same way that medicine needs a diagnosis and prognosis, so must the ocean's ability to absorb CO2, according to the project partners. Observations need to be made, and all realistic prognostic climate simulations are dependent upon a correct quantification of the ocean's ability to act as a sink for CO2. Central to this is determining the role the ocean plays in CO2 uptake and in sink formation. By identifying the role, researchers could develop realistic climate simulations in the future.

					<p>As African leaders prepare to present an ambitious proposal to industrialized countries for coping with climate change in the part of the world that is most vulnerable to its impacts, a new study points to where and how some of this money should be spent. Published in the peer-reviewed journal Agricultural Systems, the study projects that climate change will have highly variable impacts on East Africa’s vital maize and bean harvests over the next two to four decades, presenting growers and livestock keepers with both threats and opportunities. Previous estimates by the study’s authors projected moderate declines in the production of staple foods by 2050 for the region as a whole but also suggested that the overall picture disguises large differences within and between countries. The new findings provide a more detailed picture than before of variable climate change impacts in East Africa, assessing them according to broadly defined agricultural areas. “Even though these types of projections involve much uncertainty, they leave no room for complacency about East Africa’s food security in the coming decades,&quot; said the lead author of the new study, Philip Thornton of the ILRI. “Countries need to act boldly if they’re to seize opportunities for intensified farming in favoured locations, while cushioning the blow that will fall on rural people in more vulnerable areas.” (Source: CGIAR, 4 November 2009)</p>
