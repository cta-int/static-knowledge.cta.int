						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>As the food situation in Africa becomes critical, the continent's governments have been asked to immediately start giving farming subsidies to overcome a crisis that could condemn millions of people to starvation. Akinwumi Adesina, who heads the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (Agra) office in Nairobi, says now is the time for Africa to say &quot;No&quot; to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund imposed programmes, which he said are to blame for the failure by African farmers to even feed themselves (Source: Catherine Riungu, The East African, 05 October 2008)</p>

					<p>The rise of organic farming and rejection of GM crops in Britain and other developed countries is largely to blame for the impoverishment of Africa, according to the government's former chief scientist. Sir David King, who left the job at the end of last year, says anti-scientific attitudes towards modern agriculture are being exported to Africa and holding back a green revolution that could dramatically improve the continent's food supply. King, who is due to give the presidential address at the British Association's Festival of Science in Liverpool this evening, will criticise non-governmental organisations and the UN in his speech for backing traditional farming techniques, which he says cannot provide enough food for the continent's growing population. &quot;The problem is that the western world's move toward organic farming - a lifestyle choice for a community with surplus food - and against agricultural technology in general and GM in particular, has been adopted across the whole of Africa, with the exception of South Africa, with devastating consequences&quot; (Source: Ian Sample, The Guardian, 8 September 2008). </p>

					<p>
Only GMOs and agrichemicals can 'feed the world,' don't you know?People involved in the sustainable food movement have been debating the best ways to promote what Wendell Berry recently called &quot;local adaptation&quot; with regard to food and agriculture. The point is to shift away from a paradigm of relying on a fossil fuel-powered agriculture system to feed people living far away from the actual farms where the food is grown. On the other side of this conversation are powerful interests who, under the guise of the imperative to provide food and nutrition to the world's poor, want to consolidate the grip of industrial agriculture over the global food system. Echoing Margaret Thatcher's old chestnut about corporate-led globalization as the only possible economic system, they declare that &quot;there is no alternative&quot; to handing control of food production over to Cargill, Monsanto, Archer Daniels Midland, and a few other companies (Source: Tom Philpott, Grist, 8 September 2008). </p>

					<p>Rwanda’s plans to transform the agricultural sector from traditional subsistence to market-driven, commercial farming will help improve food security, a senior official said. Agriculture and animal resources minister Christopher Bazivamo said the government’s priorities included the reduction of soil erosion, which had washed away about 15 million metric tonnes of fertile soil in the past decade. It would also increase the amount of terraced land from 193,735 hectares to 1 million by next year and reclaim marshland, using part of a US$41 million grant from the World Bank. However, an infusion of cash alone would not transform the agricultural sector, according to specialists (Source: IRIN, Kigali, 6 August 2008). </p>

					<p>Nigeria, self-sufficient in food not so long ago, currently spends an annual three billion dollars on imported products to feed itself, with the agricultural sector now seen as a victim of the 1960s oil boom. Although Nigeria has 79 million hectares of fertile land, only 32 million, 46 percent, are cultivated. More than 90 percent of agricultural output is produced by households with access to less than two hectares. Nigeria, like most developing countries, has been hard hit by soaring food prices in recent months. The price of rice, a staple cereal in this country of 140 million, has more than doubled in past months. According to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), in 1960, the year of independence, more than 70 percent of the country’s came from the agricultural sector while mining, including crude oil, contributed a mere 1.2 percent. An estimated 95 percent of the nation’s food needs was locally produced. In 2006, oil accounted for 61.2 percent of GDP and 80 percent of budget revenue (Source: by Joel Olatunde Agoi, AFP, 8 July 2008).</p>

					<p>Good weather and government subsidies on seed and fertiliser helped produce a million tonne maize surplus in Malawi in 2007&quot;. In 2006, Malawi's maize harvest was the highest on record. A year later, the new record was smashed by a harvest that was nearly a third bigger again. Two years of good weather, combined with a government programme of subsidies on fertiliser and improved maize seed, created a one million tonne maize surplus. Much of this was exported to Zimbabwe, boosting Malawian national pride as well as its coffers. And this from a country ranked as fifth poorest in the world, long plagued by a narrow economic base and scarce natural resources (Source: The New Agriculturist, July 2008).</p>

					<p>Caution needs to be exercised in developing African food production to avoid long-term social and environmental harm, according to an ecologist credited with averting mass hunger on the continent. Hans Herren, president of the U.S.-based Millennium Institute, says that some of the prescriptions offered for extricating Africa from its current crisis over high food prices may ultimately cause more damage than good. Aid specifically geared to help unlock the potential of African agriculture has slumped, too. Even though the total amount of all development aid given by rich countries to the poor grew by 250 percent between the early 1980s and 2005, the proportion of that assistance devoted to farming fell from 17 percent to 3 percent (Source: by David Cronin, IPS, 3 July 2008).</p>

The fourth Yara Prize was awarded Wambugu for her many distinguished achievements in research and networking in East Africa, and to Mfinanga for his determined entrepreneurship in establishing a dairy business in Tanzania. The Yara Foundation recognizes that a major part of the green revolution in Africa involves strengthening food security, securing both larger quantities of food, and better quality food, by improving both agricultural productivity and the nutritional value of crops. Furthermore, it is imperative to develop entire value chains, both in respect of providing inputs – including knowledge – to the farmers, and securing market access for their outputs (products). For the Yara Prize 2008, the Yara Foundation focused on candidates who have proven track records in improving food security and entrepreneurial visions for making future contributions (Source: Africa News Network, 3 July 2008).</p>

					<p>Harvesting of the 2008 main season cereal crops is underway or due to start soon in Somalia, Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya. In Ethiopia the harvest of the secondary &quot;belg&quot; crop is in progress. Although the important March-May rains improved towards the end of the period, cumulative totals remain below normal in large areas of Ethiopia, Somalia, parts of western Kenya and in the Karamoja region of Uganda. Thus, crop prospects in these countries remain generally poor. The failure of the 2008 Gu crop, which follows two below-average seasons (Gu 2007 and Deyr 2007/08), has resulted in a critical food supply position. The humanitarian situation is rapidly deteriorating due to a combination of increasing food prices, a significant devaluation of the Somali Shilling, disruption of internal markets and internal trade, and mounting civil insecurity. Overall, sorghum prices have increased in the Sorghum Belt by more than 60 percent since January 2008. In April, the highest sorghum prices were in Beletweyne market (SOS 7 500 per kg) and Hudur (SOS 7 250 per kg). The lowest prices were reported in Bardera and Baidoa where sorghum was quoted SOS 3 600 per kg and SOS 5 150 per kg, respectively (Source: FAO/GIEWS Global Watch, 15 July 2008).</p>

					<p> Thirty years after the first “green revolution” transformed agriculture in Asia and Latin America, as new seed varieties and copious fertiliser enabled farmers to break out of the subsistence trap, Africa is trying to follow suit. Farmers, agronomists and development experts say that new technology alone, particularly in the short term, will bring no radical transformation. Quicker gains can be made improving markets and transport, which will help expand existing, under-used technologies. But there is disagreement over whether Africa should seek an agribusiness model based on big commercial farms or concentrate on improving the lot of its millions of smallholders. Moreover, the difficulties in transforming African agriculture are manifold. Africa’s agricultural research capability has received almost as little attention as its soils in recent decades, its cash-strapped governments having cut back heavily on basic science. The green revolution will have to confront one of the most controversial issues in world farming: genetically modified crops. African countries have been slow to adopt GM. Indeed, the way in which new and existing technologies interact with the economies and societies of Africa is critical, not just to whether the green revolution will work technically but also whether it will bring widespread benefits to Africa’s poor.

					<p> ROME — Is there a food crisis? In the strictest definition, no. There is hunger, but no starvation. There are sporadic food riots in the poorest countries, but no widespread, out-of-control urban panic. Viewed in a different way, the crisis is genuine and potentially horrific. The brutal truth is that the world has consumed more food than it has produced for the past eight years. Global stocks for rice and soya, the staple foods for billions of people, have fallen to 10 to 15 per cent of annual consumption from about 20 per cent (the stock-to-use ratio). In other words, the world is no more than two months - a month short of the next harvest - from running out of food. Medium- and long-term solutions are where the challenges lie. Where should the money and energy go? In spite of food's near vertical price curve since 2006, prices, adjusted for inflation, are still well below their mid-1970s level. The food &quot;crisis&quot; may just be getting started. Source: Eric Reguly, Globe and Mail, June 2, 2008. </p>

					<p> The effects of the food crisis can be seen plastered across the front pages of newspapers: food riots, ration cards, export bans, a US farm bill which included an unprecedented outlay for food stamps. But these short-term responses represent mere acts of desperation intended to temporarily alleviate some of the food shortages, and only hint at some of the medium-term and long-term implications, which are outlined below. In virtually every major country and region, inflation is approaching dangerous levels. The world’s poor have clearly born the brunt of the food crisis, but surely some people are benefiting, right? Look no further then agribusiness, the loose collection of interests that vastly influence the production and distribution of agricultural products in the US. Naturally, the agribusinesses have pledged to use a portion of their profits to help poor countries with their food problems. Source: CurrencyTrading.net, June 4, 2008. </p>

					<p> Key institutions involved in agricultural research and funding have signed a Memorandum of Understanding aimed at significantly increasing food production in Africa’s “breadbasket regions,” link local food production to food needs, and work across Africa’s major agricultural growing areas—or agro-ecological zones—to create opportunities for smallholder farmers. The MOU was signed by the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and the World Food Programme (WFP) at the FAO High-Level Conference on World Food Security. The agreement marks a significant transformation in the way major global agencies work with smallholder farmers to assist them in solving Africa’s chronic hunger and food problems. The new partnership will help to advance the goal of the Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP) of the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD) towards achieving at least 6 percent annual growth rate in agricultural production by 2015.

Launched jointly by the Africa Rice Center (WARDA), Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), IFDC, Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the Emergency Rice Initiative will operate under the framework of the FAO Soaring Food Prices Initiative. “Our primary aim is to enhance the capacity of our member countries to significantly increase their rice production as of 2008 and 2009,” said Dr Papa Abdoulaye Seck, Director General of the Africa Rice Center, an association of African member countries and one of the 15 centers supported by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).

					<p> According to a new study by experts from the world's leading agronomic and agricultural economics research institution - the Wageningen University &amp; Research Centre - neither speculation nor biofuels are to blame for the current high food prices. Instead, and despite some people's attempts to focus excessively on these factors, a complex set of many other forces is at play. Wageningen UR also projects world food prices to decline again, continuing the historic long term trend towards ever lower prices for food. What is more, compared with all other commodities, food prices have increased far less dramatically. Wageningen UR asked a number of its experts to contribute to the national and international discussion by offering analysis from different perspectives. It seems that the current wave of price surges is such a peak. The current peaks in the prices are lower than the peak in the food prices in the 1970s, which was the result of the oil crisis. Of course, the trend can change, but the expectation is that the response to the current, high prices - increased, large investments in agriculture - will again cause a decline.
