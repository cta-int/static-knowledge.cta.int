						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>The Joint Programming Initiative <a href="http://www.faccejpi.com/" target="_blank">FACCE–JPI</a> has announced the approval for funding of its first joint action which brings together 67 research groups from 17 European countries. The initiative’s research agenda will address the modelling of impacts of climate change on European agriculture and food security and the reduction of uncertainties in climate change scenarios. An innovative, tailor-made instrument, a ‘Knowledge Hub’, was developed by the FACCE–JPI, associating three complementary dimensions: networking, research and capacity building.

					<p>Research led by the University of East Anglia (UEA), UK, challenges previously held notions about poverty and adaptation by investigating why fishermen stick with their trade despite dwindling catches. The research team surveyed almost 600 fishers in five African countries and found that half of the fishermen would not be tempted to seek out a new livelihood - even if their catch declined by 50%. Fishermen in the more vibrant and developed economies were less likely to give up the trade than those from poorer communities. The researchers noted that fishermen in Madagascar, a country they rated as poor, would sooner leave the fisheries sector than those in the Seychelles, a wealthier country. Decisions are influenced by much more than simple profitability; the fishermen also consider job satisfaction, family tradition, sense of identity among a range of other factors. Fisheries are challenged by the combined effects of overfishing, climate change, deteriorating ecosystems and conservation policies. Understanding how fishermen respond to these changes is critical to managing fisheries, and identifying intervention points for conservation policies, the authors believe.

					<p>World Watch Institute's 'Nourishing the Planet' project describes another little known food crop with an untapped potential for securing food security. Giant swamp taro (<i>Cyrtosperma chamissonis</i>) is more abundant on Pacific atolls than its cousin, the taro (<i>Colocasia esculenta</i>), but it is much less commercially available. Its traditional cultivation is labour intensive and dependent upon a consistently saturated environment, which makes it practical to grow only in small, marshy plots. Swamp taro is a native plant of the Philippines that has dozens of varieties thriving on most of the tropical islands in the Pacific. Giant swamp taro is grown and harvested in small patches for its underground tubers, called corms. Atoll farmers often grow giant swamp taro as part of complex polycultures, in the shade of larger trees. Researchers consider the potential of giant swamp taro to be largely untapped, partly because it is not often studied by researchers and techniques for improving the plant's cultivation have not been developed.

					<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/news/african-agriculture-dirt-poor-1.10311" target="_self">This news report</a> by <i>Nature</i> explains the importance of fertilizers in keeping Africa’s soils nourished and the action taken by decision-makers. Fertilizers make a profound difference because the rusty red soil, as in many parts of Africa, is deficient in organic matter and in key nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. African governments, international donors and scientists agree that farmers must revitalize their soils, but don’t on the best way to tackle the challenge. Many African governments and agricultural scientists argue that large doses of inorganic fertilizers are the most practical solution. But others are pushing for greener, cheaper solutions, such as no-till farming that conserves soil and 'fertilizer plants' that boost the soil's nitrogen content organically. Researchers report that these latter techniques are beginning to raise yields and improve soil fertility. But farmers are slow to adopt such practices, which require significantly more labour. The report gives an extensive overview of the latest efforts in soil conservation and examines governments and NGOs answers to the problem.

					<p>While last month’s climate negotiations in Durban made incremental progress towards helping farmers adapt to climate change and reduce agriculture’s climate footprint, a group of international agriculture experts, led by Sir John Beddington, writing in the January 20 issue of <i>Science</i> magazine (‘What Next for Agriculture After Durban?’), urges scientists to lay the groundwork for more decisive action on global food security in environmental negotiations in 2012. The authors see a need for more ‘integrated research’ focused on sustainable agricultural practices that are appropriate for ‘different regions, farming systems, and landscapes’, particularly in low income countries where climate change is expected to pose the greatest challenge. The goal, the authors said, is to achieve a ‘safe operating space’ where farmers can produce enough food to meet global needs while adapting to various climatic stresses and also minimizing the environmental impact of food production.(<a href="http://ccafs.cgiar.org/news/researchers-outline-food-security-climate-change-road-map-science%20" target="_blank">CCAFS</a> via <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6066/289%20" target="_blank">Science</a>, 19/01/2012) </p>

					<p>An international team of researchers have finished a global empirical study that suggests that preservation of plant biodiversity is crucial to buffer negative effects of climate change and desertification in drylands. The results of this study indicate that the ability for ecosystems to maintain multiple functions, such as carbon storage and build-up of nutrient pools is enhanced by an increase in the number of plant species and reduced by the rise in average annual temperature, in drylands worldwide. This study is the first to explicitly evaluate such relationships in ecosystems at a global scale.

					<p>This doctoral research project from the University of Wageningen , the Netherlands, examines processes and technologies that could improve the control of the parasitic weed <i>Striga sp </i>. The project reviles that rice plants that produce less carotene than usual are less infected by the <i>Striga sp</i> parasite. Striga seeds only germinate when specific plant root secreted hormones called <i>strigolactones</i>–, are present in the soil. Plants produce strigolactones from carotene. Hence, reducing the production of carotene and consequently strigolactones resulted in a 75% reduction of striga seed germination.(<a href="http://www.wur.nl/UK/newsagenda/news/Ne_Striga_.htm" target="_blank">Wageningen UR</a>, 12/ 01/2012)</p>

					<p>
A new study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, finds that consuming bushmeat had a positive effect on children’s nutrition, raising complex questions about the trade-offs between human health and environmental conservation. They further estimated that a loss of access to wildlife as a source of food – either through stricter enforcement of conservation laws or depletion of resources – would lead to a 29 percent jump in the number of children suffering from anemia. Because bio-available iron is primarily sourced from meat, the researchers hypothesized that increased consumption of wildlife would result in a reduced incidence of clinical anemia.

	The world's major river systems have enough water to double food production by 2050 if the resource - a potential source of conflict – is used efficiently and distributed fairly through the breadbaskets of ten river basins, says a worldwide study released in Brazil at the XIV World Water Congress. The study, from the Challenge Program on Water and Food (CPWF) of the CGIAR, finds that inefficient use and inequitable distribution of water are the problem, not water scarcity. The study, a result of five years of research by scientists in 30 countries, is the most comprehensive effort to date to assess how, over vast regions, people are coping with the growing need for water. The ten river basins that were studied are: the Andes and São Francisco in South America; the Limpopo, Niger, Nile and Volta basins in Africa; and the Indus-Ganges, Karkheh, Mekong, and Yellow in Asia.(<a href="http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/river-basins-could-double-food-production-study/" target="_blank">AlertNet</a>, 26/9/2011)</p>

	A <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/108/33/13432" target="_blank">new study</a> conducted by Mauricio Bellon, Programme Director at Bioversity International, and colleagues, throws light on the ways that smallholder famers will be able to obtain seeds that will cope with climate change. The team surveyed Mexican maize farmers in four different agro-ecological zones to find out where the farmers got their seed and then modelled how variation in regional climate might affect their environment. For all communities except those in the highlands, predicted future maize environments are already represented within the 10-km radial zones, indicating that in the future farmers will have easy access to adapted planting material. Farmers in the highlands are the most vulnerable and probably will need to acquire seed from outside their traditional geographical ranges. This change in seed sources probably will entail important information costs and the development of new seed and associated social networks, including improved linkages between traditional and formal seed systems and more effective and efficient seed-supply chains. The approach pioneered in this research, of integrating information about seed systems with fine-scale examination of predicted climate shifts, is important because it has the potential to be applied in other regions and countries.

					<p>Experts working on the Guinea’s agricultural investment strategy have made sure proper nutrition and hygiene are part of the 2011-2015 Agriculture Plan. The new section of the investment plan covers nutrition education, improving access to nutrient-rich foods, treatment of malnutrition, and complementary feeding for infants.It is said the move stems in part from a 2010 forum of the Economic Community of West African States, at which experts said it was time to create an institutional bridge between the health and agriculture sectors and incorporate nutrition into overall development.(<a href="http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=93169" target="_blank">IRIN News</a>, 7/7/2011)</p>

	Stanford agricultural scientist David Lobell and researchers at CIMMYT report in the inaugural issue of <i>Nature Climate Change</i> (<a href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.nature.com/nclimate/index.html</a>) that a clear negative effect of warming on maize production was evident in experimental crop trial data conducted in Africa by the organization and its partners from 1999 to 2007. Led by Lobell, the researchers combined data from 20,000 trials in sub-Saharan Africa with weather data recorded at stations scattered across the region. They found that a temperature rise of a single degree Celsius would cause yield losses for 65 percent of the present maize-growing region in Africa - provided the crops received the optimal amount of rainfall. The data recorded at the yield testing sites did not include weather information. Instead, the researchers used data gathered from weather stations all over sub-Saharan Africa. Although the stations were operated by different organizations, all data collection was organized by the World Meteorological Organization, so the methods used were consistent. Lobell then took the available weather data and interpolated between recording stations to infer what the weather would have been like at the test sites. By merging the weather and crop data, the researchers could examine climate impacts.Source: Sciencedaily, 14 Mar. 2011, see <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110313160025.htm" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110313160025.htm </a>and The Economist, 17 Mar. 2011, see <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18386161" target="_blank">http://www.economist.com/node/18386161</a></p>

	The biggest challenge in Papua New Guinea is accessing the knowledge and technologies for developing possible products from sweet potato that can be sold on the local markets. Sweet potato has not been accorded the importance it deserves in the people’s diets despite the fact that it is produced and consumed in large quantities and has nutritional and economic value. There is a need to consider alternative ways for farmers to use their surplus sweet potatoes. To address some of these issues, a sweet potato food fair was held on 3 February 2011 at the Anglimp South Wagi District Administration office in Minj, Jiwaka Province, PNG. The food fair was funded under the auspices of ACIAR (Australia) funded project.(Source: PNG NARI, 14 Feb. 2011).</p>

	The term “nightshade” refers collectively to a wide-ranging group of plants, including poisonous, medicinal, and edible species (from the genus Solanum). This includes three major crops of global importance: tomato, potato, and eggplant. The broad-leafed African nightshade (Solanum scabrum) is widely cultivated in sub-Saharan Africa on smallholder plots and in home gardens around cities. African nightshade is sometimes referred to as black nightshade or garden huckleberry. The vegetable is an excellent source of protein, iron, vitamin A, iodine, zinc. Nightshades are traditionally used worldwide as medicinal plants, especially to treat stomach ailments. Leaf extracts from African nightshade are used to treat diarrhea, eye infections, and jaundice. The raw fruit is sometimes chewed to treat stomach ulcers or stomachache. There are no solid statistics on how much African nightshade is currently cultivated. But the crop is one of the most important indigenous leafy vegetables in West and Central Africa, and to a lesser extent East Africa, according to Plant Resources of Tropical Africa (PROTA). Cameroon produces enough African nightshade to export to neighboring countries. According to Patrick Maundu at Bioversity International, demand for the crop has recently risen significantly since East African supermarkets started stocking it. In September of 2010, Kenyan Professor Mary Onyango-Abukutsa—who is quoted in ‘State of the World 2011: Innovations that Nourish the Planet’ - was awarded a grant by Kenya’s National Council for Science and Technology to lead research on African indigenous vegetables at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology. Her research will focus on three key vegetables: African nightshade, spider plant, and amaranth. Professor Mary Onyango-Abukutsa was the first place winner of the 2008/2009 Africa-wide Women in Science Competitions that was organized by CTA in collaboration with several partners.(source: Worldwatch Institute, 7 Feb. 2011)</p>
