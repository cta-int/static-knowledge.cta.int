						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Xin Tian, molecular plant scientist at the University of Edinburgh and Peter Doerner, plant cellular physiologist at INRA, France, review the literature on resource &nbsp;foraging, the process by which root system architecture changes over time to acquire resources. The study brings to light the high diversity of root behaviour, &nbsp;including foraging, observed in different species, even in different accessions of the same species, revealing its adaptive nature. The scientists see the need for more &nbsp;fundamental research into root growth mechanisms to inform transgenic approaches and breeding programmes based on existing germplasm. Research into root &nbsp;foraging should not be restricted to crop plants and their interactions, they conclude, saying there is much to learn from wild plants how inter-species competition &nbsp;and different niches have shaped root foraging strategies in evolution in the quest for more resilient performance for crops experiencing environmental stresses. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Systems_Biology/10.3389/fpls.2013.00303/full" target="_self">http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Systems_Biology/10.3389/fpls.2013.00303/full</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(Front.

					<p>This report from the ‘Evidence for Policy Series’ by NCCR North-South (Switzerland) details how soil spectroscopy, the study of the spectral fingerprint of dry soil &nbsp;samples, provides a novel and affordable way to assess and monitor soil the quality of agricultural soils and ultimately support policy making. Spectroscopy can &nbsp;provide the required baseline data on soils land-management policies need. Soil spectroscopy is a novel technology that can quantify the carbon in the soil, along &nbsp;with many other soil properties. Compared to conventional analysis methods, the technology is non-destructive, inexpensive, and fast. It is an ideal tool for large -scale monitoring and surveillance of soil fertility. The technology is versatile and can be applied both in the laboratory and the field, with less costly infrastructure. In &nbsp;conjunction with remote sensing imagery and geographic position systems, soil spectroscopy can be used for area-wide monitoring of surface soils. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.nccr-north-south.unibe.ch/publications/Infosystem/On-line%20Dokumente/Upload/Regional_Policy_Brief_07_HOA_Soil_Spectroscopy(1).pdf" target="_self">http://www.nccr-north-south.unibe.ch/publications/Infosystem/On-line%20Dokumente/Upload/Regional_Policy_Brief_07_HOA_Soil_Spectroscopy%281%29.pdf</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(NCCR Switzerland, 09/09/2013) &nbsp;</p>

					<p>David Filiberto at Cornell University and John Gaunt&nbsp; of Carbon Consulting,&nbsp; Ithaca, USA explain why the need for further clarity on optimising biochar (charcoal) application to various crop yields is necessary if it is to gain widespread acceptance as a soil amendment. Biochar may be added to soils with the intention to improve the soil, displace an amount of conventional fossil fuel based fertilisers, and sequester carbon. However, the economics of biochar use as a soil conditioning amendment are challenging. The authors suggest that further research is needed to determine the optimal biochar application rate. They believe that strategies focused on high value crops that require high levels of fertiliser application may prove more fruitful in sustaining the economic viability of the technique. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/3/4/715" target="_self">http://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/3/4/715</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Agriculture</i>, 17/10/2013)</p>

					<p>J. Bayala, ICRAF-WCA, Mali and colleagues in West Africa carried out an experiment in Burkina Faso to characterise crop-tree interactions under a series of tree maintenance regimes. The treatment included root trenching and crown pruning of two tree species <i>Parkia biglobosa</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Vitellaria paradoxa</i>, known to improve soil fertility and redistribute water, in a sorghum field. The results show that sorghum yield vary significantly depending on the treatment and the species used. An implication of this is that recommendations for including trees in cropland, or for management of existing trees within cropland, must be context and species specific. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.academicjournals.org/journal/AJAR/article-abstract/668AEEC41678" target="_self">http://www.academicjournals.org/journal/AJAR/article-abstract/668AEEC41678</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>African Journal of Agricultural Research,</i> Vol. 8 No. 43, 11/2013)</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.frontiersin.org/people/u/34309" target="_self">Louise H. Comas</a>, US Depart. of Agriculture, Colorado and colleagues in the USA have identified a number of root traits associated with maintaining plant productivity under drought. These include small fine root diameters, long specific root length, and root length density. Small xylem diameters in targeted seminal roots appear to save soil water deep in the soil profile for use during crop maturation and result in improved yields. Capacity for deep root growth and large xylem diameters in deep roots may also improve root acquisition of water when ample water at depth is available. The authors believe a better understanding of root functional traits and how traits are related to plant productivity under different drought conditions is needed. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpls.2013.00442/abstract" target="_self">http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpls.2013.00442/abstract</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>Front.

					<p>Esin Mete, President of the International Fertilizer Industry Association (IFA), explains how fertilisers fortified with micronutrients – adding selenium, zinc or iodine to the nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium usually present – can augment the nutritional content of a number of staple food and positively affect the health of a population. Her main point is that micronutrient fortification of nutrient-deficient soils can not only help boost crop yields but also improve the content and bioavailability of these nutrients in plants when consumed by humans. Mete cites results from successful experiments in Finland, India, China and Malawi where nutrient deficiency in humans has been tackled by using nutrient enriched fertilisers to grow staple food. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.foodsecurity.ac.uk/blog/index.php/2013/10/fortifying-fertilizers-can-fortify-food/" target="_self">http://www.foodsecurity.ac.uk/blog/index.php/2013/10/fortifying-fertilizers-can-fortify-food/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, 16/10/2013)</p>

					<p>The findings of a study led by Matthew Bowker, assistant professor of forest soils and ecosystem ecology at Northern Arizona University, shows that, as drylands of the world become even drier, levels of nutrients in the soil will be affected, and their imbalance could affect agricultural productivity around the globe.

					<p>Scientists at the Joint Research Centre’s (JRC) Institute for Environment and Sustainability of the European Commission published an article on a modelling platform to estimate organic carbon stock in European agricultural soils in the <i>Global Change Biology</i> journal. Soil organic carbon is an essential indicator of good soil quality. It improves the physical properties of soil, notably by increasing its nutrient retention and groundwater protection capacities. To provide consistent carbon stock estimation at the European scale, the model computed almost 164 000 combinations of soil, climate, and land use data, resulting in new soil organic carbon datasets at the pan-European level. The platform provides a comprehensive modelling platform with comparable and harmonised European geographical and numerical datasets. It should prove to be a very useful tool to orient future policymaking decisions related to soil.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu/news/620/155/Organic-carbon-stock-in-agricultural-soils.html" target="_self">http://ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu/news/620/155/Organic-carbon-stock-in-agricultural-soils.html</a>(EC JRC IES, 17/12/2013)&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Crop-livestock production systems are the largest cause of human alteration of the global nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycles. This research report by Mario Herrero (ed) of ILRI is a comprehensive spatially explicit inventory of N and P budgets in livestock and crop production systems. It shows that in the beginning of the 20th century, nutrient budgets were either balanced and surpluses if any were small and that between 1900 and 1950, global soil N surplus almost doubled and P surplus increased by a factor of 8. Between 1950 and 2000, the global surplus of N increased by almost 400% and that of P to more than 500%. Most surplus N is an environmental loss and surplus P is lost by runoff or accumulates as residual soil P. Despite rapidly increasing recovery of N and P in crop and livestock, global nutrient surpluses continue to increase. Alternative management of livestock production systems shows that combinations of intensification, better integration of animal manure in crop production, and matching N and P supply to livestock requirements can effectively reduce nutrient flows. A shift in human diets, with poultry or pork replacing beef, can reduce nutrient flows in countries with intensive ruminant production. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/110/52/20882.full" target="_self">http://www.pnas.org/content/110/52/20882.full</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>PNAS</i>, 24/12/2013) &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

					<p>A new study of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA, Austria), published in the journal <i>Global Change Biology,</i> demonstrates that a growing imbalance between phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizer use in Africa would lead to crop yield reductions of nearly 30% by 2050. Underuse of phosphorus-based fertilizers in Africa currently contributes to a growing yield gap – the difference between how much crops could produce in ideal circumstances compared to actual yields. This phosphorus-specific yield gap currently lies at around 10% for subsistence farmers, but will grow to 27% by 2050 if current trends continue. While nitrogen-based fertilizer usage has begun to increase in Africa in the last 10 years, the application of phosphorus to cropland has not kept pace, leading to a growing imbalance between nitrogen and phosphorus levels in soil. The new study shows that increases in nitrogen and phosphorus inputs must happen in a way that provides crops with the balanced nutrient input they need. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/news/20140128-phosphorus-africa.html" target="_self">http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/news/20140128-phosphorus-africa.html</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(IIASA, 28/01/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>IFAD and the Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security Organisation (CCAFS) commissioned two studies with the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD) to identify supporting and hindering factors for the adoption of conservation agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa. The first reviewed the effects of conservation agriculture on crop yields, identifying the agro-ecological and management conditions that favour positive crop responses. The second study, explored the merits of an assessment tool to predict the likelihood of conservation agriculture adoption in a given project region. &nbsp;&nbsp;The key findings from the first study proved that the combination of the three main principles of conservation agriculture are not, in many situations, an option. For instance, no-tillage has to be associated with mulching to result in higher crop yield. Additionally, crop rotation has to be an integral component with farmers moving from continuous mono-cropping systems to the inclusion of different crop types and preferably vegetables. These two factors are, for many smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, the bottlenecks to adoption. Crop residues have several other competing uses on the farm, in particular as feed for livestock. &nbsp; &nbsp;The second study explored the degree of accuracy of the qualitative expert assessment tool for conservation agriculture adoption (QAToCA). It discovered that the QAToCA tool can help in identification of the socio-ecological niches (e.g. preferences, prices, production objectives etc.) and specific sites for successful promotion of diverse CA practices and technologies. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://ifad-un.blogspot.nl/2014/03/conservation-agriculture-factors-for.html" target="_self">http://ifad-un.blogspot.nl/2014/03/conservation-agriculture-factors-for.html</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(IFAD social reporting blog, 25/03/2014)</p>

					<p>A team of agronomists, entomologists, agro-ecologists, horticulturists and bio-geochemists from the Pennsylvania State University's College of Agricultural Sciences, led by Meagan Schipanski, has been developing a framework for considering a suite of ecosystem services that could be derived from agricultural land. The team quantified the benefits offered by cover crops across more than 10 ecosystem services. Benefits included increased carbon and nitrogen in soils, erosion prevention, more mycorrhizal colonisation – beneficial soil fungus that helps plants absorb nutrients – and weed suppression. By integrating a suite of ecosystem services into a unified analytical framework, the researchers highlighted the potential for cover crops to influence a wide array of ecosystem services. They estimated that cover crops increased eight of 11 ecosystem services. In addition, they demonstrated the importance of considering temporal dynamics when assessing management system effects on ecosystem services. &nbsp;Editor’s note: Cover cropping has been practiced by smallholder farmers in developing countries for several years. This research confirms the reasoning for maintaining this practice. &nbsp;<a href="http://news.psu.edu/story/308073/2014/03/18/research/research-reveals-true-value-cover-crops-farmers-environment" target="_self">http://news.psu.edu/story/308073/2014/03/18/research/research-reveals-true-value-cover-crops-farmers-environment</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Pennsylvania State University, 18/03/2014)</p>

					<p>According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), 47% of the population could be living under severe water stress by 2050. Modern irrigation practices, including centre pivot irrigation systems, can help improve crop productivity and yields. However, irrigation is also the source of excessive water depletion from aquifers, erosion, and soil degradation. More farmers are using innovative practices to utilize water more efficiently and in lesser quantities to produce more nutritious foods. Using rainwater harvesting, zai pits (a traditional land rehabilitation technology invented by farmers in Burkina Faso), micro-irrigation, bottle irrigation, gravity drip buckets, rotational grazing systems, and other water-saving practices can all help maintain or create sustainable agricultural landscapes. Consumers too can profoundly reduce water waste and consumption, through the food choices they make each day. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://foodtank.com/news/2014/03/more-crop-per-drop" target="_self">http://foodtank.com/news/2014/03/more-crop-per-drop</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(Food Tank, 19/03/2014)</p>

					<p>Francis Issahaku Malongza Bukari, at the University of Development Studies in Ghana, investigated the nature of soil erosion on maize farms, the effects of soil erosion on maize crop farmers and the effectiveness of local control measures on output levels and the livelihoods of the farmers. The study revealed that the major effects of soil erosion were found to be the loss of fertile soils, reduction in the cultivable land area, the reduction in the crop yield and a fall in the living standards of farmers’ households. Adaptive strategies to reduce the effects of soil erosion included shifting cultivation, ridging across slopes, planting on raised mounds and avoidance of deep ploughing. Farmers who successfully applied traditional soil protection methods improved their output levels per land area and the standards of living of their families. The author recommends that modern agricultural extension services should complement, and not replace, the local knowledge systems in order to ensure sustainability in this farming region. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://jnrd.info/2013/10/indigenous-perceptions-of-soil-erosion-adaptations-and-livelihood-implications-the-case-of-maize-farmers-in-the-zampe-community-of-bole-in-the-northern-region-of-ghana-2/" target="_self">http://jnrd.info/2013/10/indigenous-perceptions-of-soil-erosion-adaptations-and-livelihood-implications-the-case-of-maize-farmers-in-the-zampe-community-of-bole-in-the-northern-region-of-ghana-2/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Journal of Natural Resources and Development</i>, 07/10/2013)</p>

					<p>A team of researchers from the University of Georgia, U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute, Hudson Alpha Institute for Biotechnology, North Dakota State University and University of California Davis has recently released the genome sequence for the common bean – which includes a number of varieties that together rank as the world’s 10th most widely grown food crop. The new whole-genome sequencing will also help to identify genetic 'markers' that can be used to speed up breeding of new bean varieties in the United States, East Africa and other countries. All of the well-known bean varieties have the highly valued ability to form symbiotic relationships with 'nitrogen-fixing' bacteria in the soil. One of the goals of the sequencing project was to better understand the genetic basis on which symbiotic relationships between nitrogen-fixing plants and bacteria are formed and sustained. The new sequencing identified a handful of genes involved with moving nitrogen around, which could be helpful to farmers who intercrop beans with other crops that don’t fix nitrogen. The researchers also discovered dense clusters of genes related to disease resistance within the chromosomes. &nbsp;&nbsp;(UC Davis, 09/06/2014)</p>

					<p>Counterfeiting gangs in Uganda are dyeing regular maize so that they have the characteristic pinkish orange colour of industrially processed maize seed. <i>The Guardian</i> reporting on the dire state of Uganda's seed system concludes that an apparent illegal industry has developed cheating farmers by selling them seeds that promise high yields but fail to germinate. The result is a crisis of confidence in commercially available high-yield seed. 'The seed market is very small compared to what you would expect from the returns to these hybrid seeds', says David Yanagizawa-Drott, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School and part of a team currently researching the problem. A pilot study conducted 18 months ago 'found significant amounts of hybrid seeds that were falsified'. &nbsp;&nbsp;(The Guardian, 08/04/2014)</p>

					<p>Using an advanced form of X-ray imaging, researchers from the University of Nottingham, in collaboration with several international research groups, discovered that the presence of even small amounts of water can influence the structure of plant roots in soil. The degree of root branching determines the efficiency of water uptake and acquisition of nutrients by plants. Any new understanding of the regulation of root branching is of vital importance, and this finding could open up new ways of improving the water and nutrient foraging qualities of important food crops and hence could significantly improve crop yields. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(University of Nottingham website, 3/06/2014)</p>

					<p>The choice of cultivated plant species to feed people and livestock influences not only food production but also soil nutrient withdrawals and fertiliser requirements. Esteban Jobbágy, Universidad Nacional de San Luis, Argentina, and Osvaldo Sala, Arizona State University, USA, report 3- to 15-fold differences in soil nutrient withdrawals per unit of energy or protein produced across major crops. These variations explain how food composition shifts over the last 20 years have reduced N, maintained P and increased K withdrawals from soils, while contributing to increasing dietary energy, protein and, particularly, vegetable fat outputs. The researchers show that global fertilisation rates do not relate to actual soil nutrient withdrawals, but to the monetary values of harvested products. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Environmental Research Letters</i>, 26/08/2014)</p>
