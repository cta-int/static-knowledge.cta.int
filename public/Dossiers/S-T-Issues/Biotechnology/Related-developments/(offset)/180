						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Developed countries need urgently to speed up the introduction of environmentally sound technologies to benefit the developing world, an international meeting on climate change and technology transfer has concluded. The two-day meeting, organised by the UN Department for Economic and Social Affairs and India's Ministry of Environment and Forests, ended in New Delhi on the 23rd of October with a statement on global cooperation on climate technology. Emerging nations need climate change technologies to be deployed on a large scale — and the time that elapses between their development and their being used in developing countries should be minimised, the meeting said. The statement is expected to be discussed at the UNFCCC summit in Copenhagen in December. (Source: Scidev.net, 28 October 2009)</p>

					<p>With food prices remaining high in developing countries, the United Nations estimates that the number of hungry people around the world could increase by 100 million in 2009 and pass the one billion mark. A summit of world leaders in Rome scheduled for November will set an agenda for ways to reduce hunger and increase investment in agriculture development in poor countries. What will drive the next Green Revolution? Is genetically modified food an answer to world hunger? Are there other factors that will make a difference in food production? This article presents a collection of commentaries of six experts that discuss whether genetically modified (GM) food can mitigate world hunger or if other changes in food production are needed.

					<p>A joint research project in Uganda supported by agricultural organisations is developing a new breed of potatoes. The breed is said to be more nutritious, resistant to weevils, and can be grown across the sub-Saharan region. This would also lead to increased income for farmers because the high value sweet potatoes will have a ready market. The programme involves scientists from Namulonge Research Centre, which is run under the Sweet Potato Action for Security and Health in Africa project. The programme is funded by the $2.2 million grant, which is part of the $12 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. (Source: allAfrica.com, 21 October 2009)</p>

					<p>A biosafety network has received US$10 million to pursue its mission of helping African countries make informed choices about biotechnology. Bill Gates announced the US$10.4 million grant for the African Biosafety Network of Expertise (ABNE) during the World Food Prize Laureate Award Ceremony on October 15th. The funds form part of the foundation's US$120 million funding package for agriculture. The grant will enable ABNE to help African countries make informed decisions about delicate issues such as the growing of genetically modified crops. Among other initiatives, the network will organise workshops, offer short courses in biosafety and prepare policy briefs. The secretariat is being established in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. The biosafety network is a joint project between the NEPAD and the US-based Michigan State University (MSU). MSU will help train ABNE staff and provide up-to-date science-based information on biotechnology regulation but more than three-quarters of the grant will be spent in Africa.

					<p>The parasitic flowering plant <i>Striga</i>, or &quot;witchweed,&quot; attacks the roots of host plants, draining needed water and nutrients and leaving them unable to grow and produce any grains. Witchweed is endemic throughout sub-Saharan Africa, causing crop losses that surpass hundreds of millions of dollars annually and exacerbating food shortages in the region. Among the crops heavily parasitized by witchweed is the black-eyed pea, known in Africa as &quot;cowpea&quot; or &quot;niebe&quot; in Francophone countries. Now, scientists at the University of Virginia have identified a gene in cowpea that confers resistance to witchweed attack. This discovery will help researchers better understand how some plants can resist <i>Striga</i>, while others, such as corn and sorghum, are susceptible. Discovery of this resistance gene is not only important for improving cowpea, but may help in developing strategies for improving resistance to <i>Striga </i>in other affected crops. Currently there are no natural sources of <i>Striga</i> resistance in corn or sorghum, both of which are major cereal grains in the African diet. (Source: Science daily, 31 August 2009)</p>

					<p>Monsanto expects African countries to increase planting of genetically-modified crops to boost food security and economic development as the region is affected by climate change. For example, Burkina Faso plans to double the area planted with the company’s insect-resistant cotton next year from 129,000 hectares (318,766 acres) this year, said Natalie DiNicola (director at Monsanto’s public policy and sustainable yield division). Corn modified to tolerate drought may be introduced to the sub-Saharan region by 2017. Monsanto is introducing new modified seeds to boost yields as part of a plan to double gross profit from 2007 to 2012. Genetic modification technology will be increasingly accepted by developing countries as they face the problem of how to feed rapidly growing populations. Crops modified to produce better yields under limited water supply will be attractive to African countries. (Source: Bloomberg, 9 October 2009)</p>

					<p>Biotechnology is increasingly becoming recognised as one of the major engines by which countries in the Caribbean can enhance their socio-economic development. The Caribbean countries, including St Lucia, are fortunate to be endowed with biological resources, some of them being unique to specific countries such as St Lucia with its endemic plant and animal species. Biosafety is the management system that is necessary to safeguard human, animal, plant health and the environment from any possible negative impacts that may arise from the use of the products of biotechnology. CARICOM, through its Council on Trade and Economic Development, COTED, mandated a working group to develop a policy and strategy on biotechnology and biosafety for the sustainable development of the region. The draft document has been produced and is now available for dissemination around the Caribbean to get the input of stakeholders, so that they can asist in the effective implementation of the policy and strategy when it is adopted.

					<p>Drought-resistant maize varieties will be making their way from the greenhouse to the field as soon as South African scientists get the regulatory green light. The researchers at the University of Cape Town in South Africa have genetically engineered maize to contain four genes from the indigenous, desiccation-resistant <i>Xerophyta viscosa</i> plant — commonly known as the 'resurrection plant'. It has taken the research team five years to identify the genes that give <i>X. viscosa</i> its ability to withstand 95 percent dehydration, and transfer this genetic material into maize. The modified plant is expected to withstand environmental conditions that currently result in a greatly reduced harvest such as late rains. (Source: Scidev, 6 October 2009)</p>

					<p>CGIAR’s Generation Challenge Program (GCP) has recently launched a five-year, multi-partner project to deploy a web-based Molecular Breeding Platform (MBP) which will be a one-stop-shop for information, analytical tools and related services to design and efficiently conduct molecular-assisted breeding experiments. The MBP aims to pull together existing, disparate molecular breeding efforts and provide tools and technical support to enhance plant breeding efficiency in the developing world and beyond. MBP has a budget of USD 21 million, resulting from multilateral funding from various donors, though largely supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Molecular breeding, which employs molecular markers to select plants with desirable traits, has been widely used by the private sector to increase the efficiency of the breeding process. Scientists from the public sector, particularly in developing countries, however have had limited access to this technology. The new platform aims to bridge this gap.

					<p>The introduction of biotechnology to Africa must consider the needs and values of local people, argues socioeconomist Wilhemina Quaye at the Food Research Institute in Ghana. Africa has long debated the development and use of biotechnology. Advocates point to their potential for solving economic, social and environmental challenges. Critics focus on the low public funding available, problems with intellectual property rights, limited human capacity, poor infrastructure and biosafety issues. Quaye is of the opinion that anyone developing biotechnologies must respond effectively to the intended users' needs and aspirations, and better manage the perceived risks or threats associated with accepting biotechnology. To do this, biotech agendas must consider the socio-cultural realities in Africa. This will help build trust and public confidence, and aid the acceptance of biotechnology.</p>

					<p>A study conducted by IITA and the Africa College-University of Leeds in Tanzania reveals that local farmers are more interested on the productivity potential of genetically-modified (GM) crops than they are worried about the possible risks associated with their use. The study, completed in late June 2009, was carried out in consultation with the Mikocheni Agricultural Research Institute and the Tanzanian Commission for Science and Technology. It covered three districts in Tanzania. The research, which assessed the understanding and attitudes of local farmers toward GM crops using disease-resistant cassava as an example, also revealed that the level of awareness and basic understanding of GM crops by small-scale farmers is very low. Similarly, it was found that related knowledge level of local agricultural extension officers and district staff –– primary sources of information of the farmers –– was also inadequate.</p>

	The results of biosafety studies on GM crops are often controversially discussed in public debates. Michelle Marvier of the Environmental Studies Institute of Santa Clara University (USA) illuminates the reasons for conflicting study results and new approaches on how to manage such uncertainties and to improve the significance of biosafety research results. She is promoting large open-access databases for biosafety studies and the application of meta-analyses using the results of numerous studies to get a statistically more reliable picture of the environmental impact of GM crops.</p>

IITA scientists and the Nigeria's National Cereals Research Institute (NCRI) developed the rust-resistant variety, named <i>TGX 1835-10E</i>. The breakthrough is important because farmers can plant the new variety without applying expensive anti-rust chemicals. NCRI says the seeds will be available to farmers by the start of the new cropping season in 2010.</p>

The new law says any transit, import and production should be done only with a written consent granted by FEPA. (Source: ASNS, 17 July 2009)</p>

					<p>Scientists working at the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) announced recently the release of a new Soybean variety that is resistant to the Asian soybean rust - a fungal disease that could wipe out as much as 80% of infested crops. The rust-resistant soybean is the first of its kind to be made available for cultivation not only in Nigeria but also in West and Central Africa and has the potential of increasing soybean production in rust-prone areas of the region. Tagged TGx 1835-10E, the variety was bred by scientists at IITA and further developed in collaboration with the National Cereal Research Institute (NCRI). &quot;It has resistance genes that are effective against all currently known types of the rust fungus in Nigeria. IITA has bred several other varieties with rust resistance genes from various sources which can be deployed quickly if this variety succumbs to newer forms of the rust fungus&quot;, adds IITA pathologist Ranajit Bandyopadhyay.

					<p>An appeal board recently overturned opposition from the South African GMO Executive Council to allow testing of a nutritionally enhanced, genetically modified sorghum, known as 'Super Sorghum' in greenhouses in Pretoria. The application by the Council for Scientific Industrial Research (CSIR) - and endorsed by South Africa's Minister of Land Affairs and Agriculture - was successful at the second attempt when the applicant supplied additional information that it would meet biosafety requirements for the laboratory trials. The battle between supporters and critics of genetically modified (GM) crops that promise higher yields, better resistance to pests or adaptability to a changing climate is expected to increase in intensity should this trial move from the greenhouse to the fields.
