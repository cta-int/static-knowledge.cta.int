						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Plant geneticists successfully isolated the gene that creates dwarfed varieties of pearl millet. The dwarf varieties are economically important in the U.S., India and Africa, in particular. The knowledge gained in pearl millet will help to develop semi-dwarf lines with high agronomic performance in other cereal crops but dwarf varieties of pearl millet are not ideal for every planting situation. In Africa, many farmers prefer taller varieties because they use the long stalks for roofing thatch and other applications. However, where millet is intensively cultivated, dwarf millet allows farmers to harvest the grain with mechanical threshers. Ranchers like dwarf millet as a forage plant because it has a high leaf-to-stem ratio. Knowing more about the plant in general is key to broadening production of the very drought-resistant, hardy grain.&nbsp;(<a href="http://phys.org/news/2013-03-track-gene-responsible-short-stature.html" target="_blank">Phys.org</a>, 29/03/2013)&nbsp;</p>

The issue of applying intellectual property rights to indigenous knowledge, in order to protect holders of this knowledge from exploitation, while at the same time leveraging it for development was a vibrant thread of debate throughout the conference.
  <i>IP-Watch.org</i> also <a href="http://www.ip-watch.org/2013/03/20/at-us-led-workshop-african-stakeholders-call-for-home-grown-ip-agenda/" target="_self">reports</a> on the March 2013 workshop 'Practical Approaches to IP Utilization and Protection in Africa' co-organised by the US Commerce Department and the African Intellectual Property Group (AIPG), a new pro-IP association of stakeholders. Participants there emphasised the need to set an Africa IP agenda, more research on the impact of strong IPR protection, and to debunk the idea of a 'one-size-fits-all' IP policy for Africa.
 More recently, <i>IP-Watch.org</i> <a href="http://www.ip-watch.org/2013/03/20/at-us-led-workshop-african-stakeholders-call-for-home-grown-ip-agenda/" target="_self">wrote</a> about the draft protocol for the protection of new varieties of plants proposed by an inter-governmental African regional economic community, the Southern African Development Community (SADC). It reported that the Plant Variety Protection (PVP) draft protocol is provoking the ire of civil society concerned about its potential impact on small farmers, and the lack of consultation of farmers. According to the draft protocol, plant breeders' rights 'in the region will allow farmers access to a wide range of improved varieties to contribute to the attainment of the regional goal of economic development and food security'. The civil society groups said that the protocol would not develop a suitable regime to the needs of SADC member states and their farmers. The latter rely heavily on farm saved seed, exchanges with relatives and neighbours, bartering with other farmers or local markets to access seeds.

					<p>An international team of researchers used genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to determine the individual genetic make-up of 971 sorghum varieties taken from world-wide seed collections. One subject of particular scrutiny was the genetic control of the panicle, the structure on the top of the plant that holds the grains. Closely packed grains, for example, are preferred for maximum crop yield in dry areas, but in places with abundant rainfall, more spacing is desirable to allow grains dry out more readily and reduce crop losses from moisture-caused disease. The researchers identified genes that likely contribute to this physical feature, and they also mapped them geographically according to the source of the original seed. The result was insight into how different variants of the genes spread according to regional climates.&nbsp;<a href="http://phys.org/news/2013-01-sorghum-gene-bank-agriculture-climate.html" target="_blank">http://phys.org/news/2013-01-sorghum-gene-bank-agriculture-climate.html</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(phys.org, 01/2013)</p>

					<p>A large number of different plant lines are produced and maintained in a typical plant research laboratory, both as seed stocks and in active growth. These collections need careful and consistent management to track and maintain them properly, and this is a particularly pressing issue in laboratories undertaking research involving genetic manipulation due to regulatory requirements. <i>Phytotracker</i> is a laboratory management system/software designed specifically to organise and track plasmids, seeds and growing plants that can be used in mixed platform environments. It utilises the cross-platform <i>Filemaker</i> relational database, which allows it to be run as a stand-alone or as a server-based networked solution, to provide cataloguing and search functions for plasmids, seed batches, seed stocks and plants growing in pots or trays, and allows tracking of each plant from seed sowing, through harvest to the new seed batch and can print appropriate labels at each stage. The software was developed at Cardiff School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, UK by Jeroen Nieuwland and colleagues.

Varshney of ICRISAT and colleagues in <i>Nature Biotechnology</i> explains why the availability of advanced tools to support genomics-assisted breeding, should not be an issue anymore in developing orphan crops, mainly staples. However they note that the ‘magnitude of the breeding effort for those orphan crops and the capacity of adopting modern technologies is extremely variable across developing countries and generally directly related to the health of the national economy’. They believe that ‘centralized service facilities for high-throughput sequencing and genotyping, together with access to genomics and analytical breeding tools, should enhance implementation and adoption of molecular breeding in developing countries’. They recommend that ‘continued training of breeders and geneticists in modern genomics and molecular breeding approaches and their retention in developing countries coupled with adequate institutional and governmental support will be critical for the sustainable and effective integration of genomics-assisted breeding in crop improvement programmes for ensuring food security in developing countries’.<i>Nature Biotechnology</i> 30, 1172–1176 (2012). &nbsp;</p>

					<p>East African farmers petitioned the African Regional Intellectual Property Organisation (ARIPO), following the latter’s proposed draft of a regional harmonised policy and legal framework on plant variety protection. The draft policy will make it mandatory for small-scale farmers in East Africa to buy all their seeds from multinational firms and stop using seeds from past harvests. The farmers’ group faults the process used to develop the draft policy and the negative impact its adoption would have on small-scale farmers, food security and on agricultural biodiversity. The draft policy will give powers to ARIPO regional offices to grant and administer breeders’ rights on behalf of all the contracting states. It also paves the way for the African Union (AU) to start discussions on the cultivation, import and export of genetically modified crops in Africa at the next AU summit to be held in January 2013. Observers and civil society representatives have criticized these developments as they have had little access to the negotiation table and are asking ARIPO to undertake comprehensive consultations with all relevant stakeholders and desist from rushing governments into adopting the draft legislation.(<a href="http://www.ip-watch.org/2012/11/05/upov-hails-benefits-of-plant-variety-protection-civil-society-frustrated/" target="_blank">IP-Watch</a>, 5/11/2012 and <i><a href="http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/EA-farmers-want-to-breed-their-own-seeds/-/2558/1644708/-/8r9kob/-/index.html" target="_blank">The East African</a></i>, 16/12/2012)</p>

					<p>Sorghum is part of the human diet in India, Africa and parts of Japan. It is used in the United States primarily in animal feed, but it is a major U.S. export and is sold domestically to make gluten-free flour. Sorghum was originally a tropical plant, but U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) scientists are looking to Asia to increase sorghum's cold tolerance and expand its production range. They have found cold-tolerance genes in Chinese cultivars and are using them to develop lines that breeders can use to produce hardy commercial varieties. This research is considered to support the USDA priority of promoting international food security. Extending sorghum's range also would benefit growers overseas. The scientists have released the 171 inbred lines to breeders and research groups through the ARS Germplasm Resources Information Network, and at least two research groups have requested additional information on that population so far. They also published a genetic map of 141 genetic markers in Molecular Breeding that will make it easier for breeders to identify cold tolerance.(<a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2012/121017.htm" target="_blank">USDA ARS</a>, 17/10/2012)</p>

					<p>Scientists at Wageningen University &amp; Research Centre, the Netherlands, have <a href="http://www.wageningenur.nl/en/news-wageningen-ur/Show/Making-barley-less-thirsty.htm" target="_blank">discovered</a> a genetic factor that makes barley plants resistant to salt. Salinity in agricultural lands is a global problem aggravated by climate change. Researchers and plant breeders around the world are looking for opportunities to develop salt-tolerant crops. Nguyen Viet Long, a PhD student, in his research, studied the growth of barley plants in high salt conditions, with the aim of adapting barley to saline environments. He found two sequence regions in the chromosomes of barley that are both less sensitive to high concentrations of salt ions, as well as more resistant to osmotic stress caused by saline soil. Nguyen hopes barley varieties that can be cultivated in saline soils will be commercially available within five years.(Wageningen University &amp; Research Centre via Meridian Institute, 30/10/2012)</p>

					<p>Researchers at Cornell University are working on a long-term solution to ‘super weeds’ – those resistant to the herbicide glyphosate – as these weeds are cutting crop yields and raising costs for farmers, who have to spray more and with different chemicals. Three new glyphosate-resistant (GR) weed species have been documented since January 2012, for an overall total of 24.The agrichemical industry has responded by developing new transgenic crops that are resistant to multiple herbicides. Matthew Ryan, an assistant professor of crop and soil sciences, and Thomas Bjorkman, an associate professor of horticultural sciences, say this response is not a long-term solution. ‘The industry's solution doesn't get at the problem of using a single tactic for weed management. It's not just herbicides. Overusing any one method of weed management, even hand weeding, can create selection pressure on weeds to build resistance’, said Ryan.Instead, the two scientists are promoting integrated weed management (IWM) strategies, which include tactics such as cover cropping, mechanical cultivation, mowing, mulching, crop rotation and targeted herbicide application. Prevention is, however, a tough sell, says Ryan, for those farmers who aren’t currently battling GR weeds.(Cornell Chronicle summarised by Meridian Institute, 22/10/2012)<a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Oct12/CALSWeeds.html" target="_self">http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Oct12/CALSWeeds.html</a></p>

					<p>EASAC – the European Academies Science Advisory Council – announced late July 2012 the new project to address genetics and the sustainable intensification of agriculture, covering science and technology in the context of EU food security and EU-global relationship. It is meant to explore the implications of alternative policy decisions on bioscience strategies in agriculture. One of the work streams is to collect evidence on the applications of molecular biosciences in agriculture in African countries.EASAC invites contributions of written evidence to this project, to be submitted by 30 September 2012.(<a href="http://www.easac.eu/biosciences/reports-and-statements/detail-view/article/announcement.html" target="_blank">EASAC</a>, 24/7/2012)</p>

					<p>Two scientific papers on the study of the sex chromosomes of papaya have been published as cover stories in the most recent issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, the USA. Dr Qingyi Yu, a Texas AgriLife Research plant molecular biologist at Weslaco and a member of the scientific team doing the research, said their work is yielding new information about the evolution of plant sex chromosomes. Yu said she and her colleagues are studying the sex chromosomes of papaya to help growers become more efficient in the production of the fruit, estimated to grow on about one million acres worldwide. ‘Our team sequenced the hermaphrodite-specific region of the Y chromosome, HSY, and its X counterpart’, she said. ‘By comparing HSY and its X counterpart, the team revealed two large inversions occurred in the Y chromosome, which likely caused cessation of recombination between HSY and its X counterpart and resulted in additional genome rearrangements. It is surprising that the papaya X chromosome has expanded due to accumulation of transposable elements’, she continued. ‘The results changed our previous views on sex chromosome evolution.’(<a href="http://today.agrilife.org/2012/08/10/papaya-studies-in-scientific-journal/ " target="_blank">AgriLife TODAY</a>, 10/8/2012)</p>

					<p>A researcher at Purdue University, the United States, has taken maize off steroids and found that the results might lead to improvements in the crop. Mr. Burkhard Schulz, an assistant professor of horticulture and landscape architecture, wanted to understand the relationship between natural brassinosteroids – a natural plant steroid hormone – and plant architecture, specifically plant height. Mr. Schulz found that when maize loses the ability to produce brassinosteroids, it becomes a dwarf. Another feature, however, caught him off guard: the plants without the naturally occurring steroids could not make male organs – they had kernels where the tassels should be. That could be a cost-saving discovery for the seed industry. Hybrid seed producers must painstakingly remove the male pollen-producing tassels from each plant so that they do not pollinate themselves. Maize plants that produce only female organs would eliminate the detasseling step.

					<p>Scientists at the University of Nottingham, the United Kingdom, have shown that root growth can be altered in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, or thale cress, by controlling an important regulatory protein. The work was carried out by an international research team, led by scientists from the Plant Systems Biology Department in the life sciences research institute VIB and Ghent University in Belgium.The scientists modulated levels of the protein, transcription factor WRKY23, in plants, analysed the effects on root development and used chemical profiling to demonstrate that this key factor controls the biosynthesis of important metabolites called flavonols. Altered levels of flavonols affected the distribution of auxin, a plant hormone controlling many aspects of development, which resulted in impaired root growth.The results of the research can now be used to produce economically valuable new plant lines that have an improved root system, making them better able to resist environmental changes which could lead to plant damage or poor yield.(<a href="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/pressreleases/2012/january/improving-crops-from-the-roots-up.aspx%20" target="_blank">University of Nottingham</a>, 24/1/2012)</p>
