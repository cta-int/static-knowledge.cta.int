They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Begomoviruses are transmitted by the whitefly vector <i>Bemisia tabaci</i> and cause extreme reductions in the yields of a number of economically important vegetables such as tomato, pepper and okra in West and Central Africa. In this paper, Walter N. Leke, IIATA, Nigeria, and colleagues describe how they sequenced the viral genomes from various crops and identified two previously known begomovirus species (cotton leaf curl Gezira virus and okra yellow crinkle virus), a new recombinant begomovirus species (okra leaf curl<i> </i>Cameroon<i> </i>virus), a betasatellite (cotton leaf curl Gezira betasatellite) and new alphasatellites. Tomato and pepper plants with leaf curling were shown to contain isolates of new begomoviruses, collectively referred to as West African tomato-infecting begomoviruses (WATIBs), new alphasatellites and betasatellites. They found a close relationship between the begomoviruses that infect pepper and tomato and<i> </i>the weed <i>Ageratum</i><i> conyzoides,</i> and the detection of the same alphasatellite in them supports the idea that weeds are important reservoirs for begomoviruses and their satellites. &nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>Agriculture &amp; Food Security</i>, 21/01/2015)</p>

					<p>The biocompound hexanal – an artificially synthesized version of a natural substance produced by injured plants, could be used to reduce post-harvest losses. Scientists from Canada, India and Sri Lanka have tested the biocompound by spraying small concentrations in mango orchards and found that ripening of the fruits was delayed by three weeks, enabling farmers to earn up to 15% more for their crop. Once the crop is harvested, hexanal-sprayed mangoes also have a much longer shelf life—up to 26 days in cold storage and 17 days at room temperature. In another test, fruits retained their quality for much longer when packed in boxes of hexanal-impregnated banana fibres. &nbsp; &nbsp;(IDRC, 17/01/2015) &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Documents/Reducing-post-harvest-losses-in-mango-in-South-Asia.pdf" target="_self">Download</a> the publication&nbsp;</p>

					<p>In a paper presented at the 2014 International Conference on Food Security and Nutrition, Francesca V. Hansstein of the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, China, investigates recent findings on consumer knowledge and attitudes towards food traceability across the European Union (EU), China, and North America. A critical review of academic articles published between 2003 and 2013 was performed and a total of sixteen studies were selected. Results indicated that consumers are paying increasing attention to food safety and quality but they are still unfamiliar with the concept of traceability, especially in China. Willingness to pay for food safety differs across countries and segments of population. Age, education, income and food safety concerns are the factors that mostly influence consumer acceptance of traceability and its attributes. Hansstein recommends that both producers and policy makers should work together to increase consumer awareness about the benefits offered by Food Traceability Systems. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://purl.umn.edu/165744" target="_self">AgEcon Search</a>, 2014) &nbsp;</p>

					<p>The adoption of traceability systems in the food chain is a market differentiator for manufacturing firms. It is appreciated by consumers and is increasingly common after the occurrence of certain problems related to food consumption. Legislation, quality standards and best practices now govern the traceability process. This paper by Monica Sherer and Maria Gomes of UEPG, Brazil, addresses the main regulations that establish procedures for ensuring the safety of food in terms of traceability, and also presents the evolution of information technologies in this area. Although, the latter are still being developed, there are still many opportunities for growth and innovation. As a result, it is possible to see the commonalities between the models of traceability, and also to identify the points of the supply chain of wheat in which the processes are focused. &nbsp;(<i><a href="http://www.academicjournals.org/journal/AJAR/article-abstract/F8B177A44114" target="_self">African Journal of Agricultural Research</a></i>, 24/04/2014) &nbsp;</p>

					<p>David Grzywacz of the Natural Resource Institute (University of Greenwich, UK) and colleagues investigated two examples of crop protection practices in Africa that harness locally available biological resources. The researchers examined the use of the pesticidal plant <i>Tephrosia vogelii</i>, and the harvesting of the endemic insect virus <i>Spodoptera exempta </i>(SpexNPV). Both of these can be produced locally and have shown promise in trials as inexpensive and effective tools for pest control. Their use is currently being scaled up and evaluated by researchers on the continent. This focus on these unconventional crop protection systems illustrates the need to explore further the potential of locally-available natural resources to replace expensive imported agricultural inputs. The authors of the paper argue that the countries’ regulatory environment must evolve to facilitate the registration of new products and the establishment of supply chains that benefit the local producers and help them improve upon the production methods. &nbsp;<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12571-013-0313-5" target="_self">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12571-013-0313-5</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>Food Security</i>, 02/2014)&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Mohammed Suleiman, at the Department of Biology, Umaru Musa Yar’adua University, Katsina, Nigeria, carried out a series of experiments to determine the efficacy of three edible spices – garlic (<i>Allium sativum L.</i>), chili pepper (<i>Capsicum frutescens L.</i>), and ginger (<i>Zingiber officinale Rosc.</i>) against the weevil <i>Sitophilus zeamais</i> reared on sorghum grains. All the spices applied at varying amounts resulted in 100% adult mortality, showing similar effects to the conventional insecticide Permethrin. The strong aroma and contact toxicity of the spices give them the protectant properties looked for in natural pest management strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.academicjournals.org/journal/AJAR/article-abstract/27D9A1244784" target="_self">http://www.academicjournals.org/journal/AJAR/article-abstract/27D9A1244784</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>African Journal of Agricultural Research</i>, 02/2014)</p>

					<p>Laura Silva Rosales and her team at the Laboratory of Virus-Plant Interactions at the Center of Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute (Cinvestav), Mexico, designed a method capable of identifying the virus of the ringed spot (PRSV) and the mosaic virus (PapMV), two pathogens which leave ring marks in the skin of the papaya fruit and cause softening of the fruit. The system is comprised of detection cartridges (plastic tubes filled with reactive) that are deposited in a sample of a leaf.

					<p>Research by CIRAD and IITA aimed to control fruit flies infestation in West Africa’s mango plantations found that weaver ants are a natural and effective biological control method against fruit flies. In-depth studies confirmed the ants’ impact on the structure and composition of plant-eating pests. These studies also showed that they prey mainly on larvae, as they leave infested fruits, and rarely on adults.&nbsp; However, this is not their only mode of action. The scientists discovered that they have a repellent effect on fruit flies: after ants have been on mangoes, fruit flies turn away from them and lay much fewer eggs. This phenomenon of repulsion, which was confirmed in the laboratory and in the field, is caused by physical (micro-spots) and chemical (pheromones) signals left by ants. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cirad.fr/en/research-operations/research-results/2013/comment-les-producteurs-de-mangues-pourraient-ils-se-passer-des-fourmis-tisserandes" target="_self">http://www.cirad.fr/en/research-operations/research-results/2013/comment-les-producteurs-de-mangues-pourraient-ils-se-passer-des-fourmis-tisserandes</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(CIRAD, 10/2013)</p>

					<p>Scientists from CSIRO, Australia, trialled a new technique for applying herbicides to raised beds of furrow irrigated sugarcane by using a specially adapted shielded sprayer. The technique minimises the likelihood of herbicides such as diuron, atrazine, ametryn and hexazinone coming into contact with irrigation water. The conventional application of herbicides in furrow-irrigated sugarcane production is to broadcast spray across the whole field using boom sprayers. By using shielded sprayers, runoff of highly soluble herbicides showed a 90% reduction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.csiro.au/Portals/Media/Herbicide-runoff-reduced-to-Great-Barrier-Reef.aspx" target="_self">http://www.csiro.au/Portals/Media/Herbicide-runoff-reduced-to-Great-Barrier-Reef.aspx</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(CSIRO, 16/10/2013)&nbsp;</p>

					<p>A new study has revealed that global warming is resulting in the spread of crop pests towards the North and South Poles at a rate of nearly 3 km a year. The study, &nbsp;published in the journal Nature Climate Change and carried out by researchers at the University of Exeter and the University of Oxford, shows a strong relationship &nbsp;between increased global temperatures over the past 50 years and expansion in the range of crop pests. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-09/uoe-soc082913.php" target="_self">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-09/uoe-soc082913.php</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(EurekAlert, 01/09/2013)</p>

					<p>CSIRO, the Australian scientific and industrial research organisation, offers a succinct description of state-of-the-art food-processing technologies used in the &nbsp;treatment of export products. 'Cool plasma', for example, is a ionised gas containing reactive particles used to inactivate pests on the surface. Somewhat similar are &nbsp;'low energy electron beams' which inactivate bacteria, spores, fungi and insects through ionisation of the molecules in the pest.' Microwave processing' relies on large &nbsp;scale, high-power microwaves to disinfest fresh produce and grains. 'Ultrasound' is generated by vibrating plates to create water vapour cavitation bubbles that &nbsp;explode to kill pests and remove cracks and crevices on the products. Taking advantage of gentler processing methods resulting in more fresh-like quality, the &nbsp;techniques are already in use around the world. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://csironewsblog.com/2013/08/13/emerging-tech-creating-a-safer-food-chain/" target="_self">http://csironewsblog.com/2013/08/13/emerging-tech-creating-a-safer-food-chain/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(CSIRO, 13/08/2013) &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

					<p>The 100K Genome Project, led by the University of California, Davis, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, has &nbsp;added 20 newly completed genome sequences of food-borne disease-causing micro-organisms to its public database at the National Center for Biotechnology &nbsp;Information. The newly deposited sequences include several isolates of <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Listeria</i>, <i>Campylobacter</i>, and <i>Vibrio</i>, as well as a full characterisation of their &nbsp;epigenomes: the genomes were determined using Single Molecule, Real-Time Sequencing, a proprietary technology. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id=10660" target="_self">http://news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id=10660</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(UC Davis, 22/07/2013) &nbsp;</p>

					<p>The Collaborative Working Group (CWG) on IPM, working under the umbrella of the&nbsp;<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/agriculture/scar/index_en.html" target="_self">Standing Committee on Agricultural Research</a>&nbsp;(SCAR), has identified 13 key priority research and extension needs for IPM in the European Union following an extensive survey, telephone interviews, and expert discussions. The CWG has identified priority topics for potential joint actions between EU Member States, encompassing research, extension and knowledge management. Priorities fall into seven categories: Developing relevant and science-based indicators; Optimising pest monitoring systems and decision support; Designing cropping systems that prevent or minimise pest pressure; Diversifying direct control methods; managing pest evolution; social aspects, economics and assessment; and Facilitating extension for IPM. The report is available from the link below. &nbsp;(<a href="http://www.endure-network.eu/about_endure/all_the_news/priority_ipm_research_needs_identified?utm_source=K4DNewsletterEN&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_campaign=K4D_EN_May2013" target="_blank">Endure Network</a>, 14/05/2013)</p>
