They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>J.B. James, T.&nbsp; Ngarmsak and R.S. Rolle, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific Bangkok, 2010.Assuring the safety and quality of fresh-cut produce necessitates the selection of high-quality horticultural produce for processing, and the implementation of good practice during processing operations in order to maintain produce quality and assure safety of the final product. This technical guide reviews in detail from a theoretical and practical perspective, the critical issues that must be addressed if fresh-cut products are to meet consumer and market demand for convenience, quality and safety. It provides a case study on fresh-cut processing in Thailand, and describes, the fresh-cut processing of selected fruits and vegetables produced in Thailand. It should be of practical value, to small processors, trainers, extension workers and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) who provide training and support to individuals engaged in the production of fresh-cut tropical produce for sale. It also provides a useful source of information for consumers of fresh-cut tropical produce.</p>

					<p>R.S.W. Wijeratnam, <i>Acta Horticulturae.</i> (ISHS) 518:237-240, 2000.Many exotic tropical fruits remain underutilized due to the complex circumstances that encompass the production, and marketing of these commodities. &nbsp;Production and post harvest handling procedures practised in tropical regions perpetuate heavy losses, while inadequate infrastructural facilities cripple marketing prospects. Processors are faced with high production costs due to low yields obtained during processing, inadequate supplies of desired quality raw material and the high cost of packaging. Problems are faced when attempts are made to meet quality standards stipulated by sophisticated markets. Solutions to these problems lie in the establishment of organized systems of production and the introduction of suitable postharvest handling procedures. Research and development inputs are necessary with regard to selection and breeding of varieties suitable for specific processing purposes, product development, storage etc. Scientists need to provide support services to processing plants with regard to selection of machinery and equipment, trouble shooting and staff training in quality maintenance, management and handling of equipment. Waste management issues must also be addressed. Processors should have access to new technology and be provided with adequate infrastructural facilities, particularly with respect to market information, credit facilities, transport and communication. Exploitation of the potential of underutilized fruit crops will not only benefit the countries in which they are produced, but also cater to the increasing demand for exotic products in the developed world.</p>

					<p>S.K. Roy, ISHS Acta Horticulturae 518: XXV International Horticultural Congress, Part 8: Quality of Horticultural Products, 2000.Most of the underutilized fruits of the tropics are often available only in local markets and practically unknown in other parts of the world. A large number of these fruits have the ability to grow under adverse conditions and are also known for their therapeutic and nutritive value. Because of their curative properties, these fruits have been used in traditional systems of medicine since time immemorial. In addition, quite a few of these fruits have excellent flavour and a very attractive colour. There is always a market demand all over the world for new food products, nutritious and also delicately flavoured. The underutilized tropical fruits have an important role to play in satisfying these demands. Many of these fruits are highly perishable and difficult to store in the fresh form. Some of them are not easy to eat out of hand. A few are not acceptable as a fresh fruit, because of high acidity and/or strong astringent taste. However, all these fruits have unlimited potential in the world trade in their processed form. This will provide an opportunity to consumers all over the world to enjoy these tropical fruits in the form of processed products. This paper deals with the processing of some of the important tropical fruits which have tremendous potentialities in the world market.</p>

					<p>R.P. Bates,<b> </b><b>J.R. Morris and P.G. Crandall, FAO, Italy, 2001.</b>This bulletin presents both theoretical and practical information on the processing of fruit and vegetable juices, covering both the principles and practices of small and medium-scale fruit juice processing. It aims &nbsp;to fill the gap in information available to professionals as well as private entrepreneurs, mainly in developing countries. It is the medium and small-scale agro-industries that more appropriately fill the needs and capabilities of these countries, considering the available volume of production and the capacity of local markets to absorb products. The bulletin is divided into two parts. The first gives the general principles of fruit and vegetable juice processing. It starts with a general history and background of juice production and continues through fruit composition, juice grades, harvesting and post-harvest handling of the fruit, and on to the general principles of juice manufacturing and presentation. It also covers the processing of related products such as jams, jellies, pectin, essential oil, etc. The second part describes in detail the processing of specific juices as well as the major by-products. Citrus juice, especially orange juice, receives particular attention. Specific chapters are dedicated to grape, apple, stone fruits as well as a long list of tropical fruits. The methods of processing of major vegetable juices are also covered.</p>

Application of Pectinex Ultra SP-L® was optimal using 700 ppm enzyme for 1.5 hr at 50°C. Clarified guava juice was clearer (89.6%) when prepared using ultrafiltration (MW cut-off 40-60kDa) rather than plate and frame filtration (82.8%); however the latter was higher in both soluble solids and ascorbic acid. Clarified guava juice powders were made using freeze-drying, spray drying and tunnel drying. The freeze-dried product had superior quality; however the spray-dried product was stable and may be more economical.

					<p>FAO, Rome, Italy, 2007.The workshop highlighted the latest developments in technology, market structure, and trade policies in tropical fruits and their processed products. Trade in fresh and processed tropical fruit products had increased dramatically over the last 15 years, with average annual rates of growth in excess of 4% per annum. This growth had been accompanied by changes in production technology, market structures, consumer preferences and trade policies, all of which were intertwined and difficult to analyse separately. This complexity posed many uncertainties and challenges to producers and policy makers in developing countries, who found it difficult firstly to understand the current situation and secondly to transform these changing trade environments into opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

Plantains and bananas account for over 70% of production. Tropical fruit production fell with Cuba’s collapsing economy in the early 1990s. With ideal climate and land resources, production potential remains high. Production and demand will both recover and grow as Cuba’s economy recovers. If commercial relationships with the USA were restored, Cuba could initially look to US sources for quality tropical fruits for Cuba’s growing tourist market. Eventually, as Cuba’s economy and its tropical fruit sector recover, the USA could provide new market opportunities for an increasingly competitive Cuban tropical fruit sector.</p>

The project through a phased programme of activities was involved in developing and testing, cost-effective and environmentally-friendly package of fruit fly control/management options. The initiative represented a unique multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional effort to develop, test and adapt fruit protection technologies for African fruit growers through applied/adaptive research. Research activities were conducted in benchmark sites in participating African countries in East, South, West and Central Africa where fruit flies are widespread and where there has been lack of substantial investments in fruit fly research and control techniques.</p>

The study shows that the transparent margin system is a co‐innovating marketing institution which provides small farmers access to a modern market supply chain. Evolution of the innovation has created dynamic changes at the producer level. Factors that support small farmer inclusion are the farmer’s ability, willingness, and trust to make changes, and receive its benefit. Sustainability of the transparent margin system is dependent on commitment, level of trust in the partnership, the transformation of marketing institution, an innovative learning process, risk managements, and the role of rural production organisation in the marketing system. The innovation of the partnership can be replicated by facilitating and giving incentives to the supply chain champion.</p>

					<p>Y. Sangho, P. Labaste and C. Ravry, World Bank, Washington, DC, USA, 2010.The key innovation that allowed Mali to overcome obstacles arising from its situation as a landlocked country and secure access to this market was the testing and implementation - through a partnership with private operators - of a multi-modal transportation system for the export of fresh produce that would provide an alternative to air freight. Thanks to project intervention, the feasibility and profitability of using refrigerated containers all the way to the destination market in Europe, with a combination of road, rail and sea freight, was demonstrated. This innovation basically opened the way to accessing the large and growing market of sea-freighted export of perishables. This new means of transport is also good from an environmental point of view by drastically reducing the carbon foot print resulting from this trade. Once the initial innovation was tested and validated economies of scale could be achieved and the size of the potential market for Malian producers and exporters of mangoes changed dramatically. Creating the linkages between farmers and this market required the piloting of a new and stronger supply chain that has in turn brought innovative practices upstream and downstream.</p>

					<p>S. Neidhart, A.L. Vasquez-Caicedo, S. Schilling, P. Sruamsiri and R. Carle, The Global Food &amp; Product Chain — Dynamics, Innovations, Conflicts, Strategies, &nbsp;Deutscher Tropentag, October 11-13, 2005, Hohenheim, Germany, 2005.Apart from the appropriate process technology, the production of high-quality food equally depends on the selection of the proper raw material. This experience can be particularly exemplified by mango processing. In this contribution, the influence of proper raw material selection and thermal processing steps involved in small-scale batch and continuous industrial manufacture of fluid mango products on resulting provitamin A values is discussed. The provitamin A value of mango fruits and products is determined by their contents of β-carotene stereoisomers differently contributing to vitamin A biosynthesis. Concerning the selection of suitable mango cultivars at appropriate processing ripeness, accumulation of β-carotene during postharvest ripening of nine Thai mango cultivars was assessed. The vitamin A potential was evaluated at different ripening stages unequivocally defined by a ripening index. Subjected to the same postharvest ripening conditions, only those cultivars developing a bright yellow-orange mesocarp colouration resulted in high vitamin A values of 892–1573 retinol equivalents / 100 g mesocarp dry weight at their fully ripe stage. Exponential development of mesocarp colour and all-trans-β-carotene levels, respectively, with the ripening index was described for each cultivar, allowing the selection of fruits of high provitamin A values for processing by easily accessible quality parameters. Modern industrial year-round mango juice production is mostly based on puree intermediates produced during peak harvest seasons. The fruit component in the final nectar usually implies several heating treatments in the form of steam peeling, thermal inactivation of endogenous enzymes prior to enzymatic pulp liquefaction, and pasteurisation of puree and nectar, respectively. However, heat application in continuous processes is restricted to periods below 1 min. In contrast, simple small-scale batch processes at the household level require only the final pasteurisation of the filled product but by heat application for an extended process time. The effects of such thermal treatments on β-carotene degradation and isomerisation were studied by mimicking the processes at laboratory scale and by verifying the observations by stepwise process control at pilot-plant scale. The importance of fluid mango products produced at different scales as provitamin A source was demonstrated. Necessary plant physiological and technological prerequisites were identified.</p>

					<p>Conference, Cairns, Australia<i>, </i>5&nbsp;-&nbsp;9 September, 2011.High-pressure processing (HPP) technology emerged as a post-harvest, post-packaging technique for high-value avocado products in the late 90s. The North American avocado processing industry was the main drive for this innovative technology, which during the current century started to become mainstream for high-value propositions such as fresh avocado pulp or guacamole in both Mexico and the USA. The market trend towards products that can be labelled as “natural”, “minimally processed”, “with no artificial ingredients” and a clean label pushed the level of its implementation. This, together with the evolution in the technology and the improvement of HPP industrial equipment - which in the beginning of 2011 are 35% more productive and cost effective than those of i.e. 2007, or up to 50% when compared to those of 2005 - allowed HPP systems to cross borders and broaden their utilisation outside North America. In the last 24 months, avocado processing industries in Chile, Peru, Spain, Australia or New Zealand have integrated HPP lines in their plants, in an effort towards NPD, value-added propositions, market expansion, and better management of stocks and logistics.</p>

					<p>A.B. Woolf, R. Wibisono, J. Farr, M. Wohlers, I. Oey,, I. Hallett, S. Olsson, M. Farrell, G.C. Fletcher, C. Requejo-Jackman. &nbsp;Proceedings of The World Avocado Conference, Cairns, Australia<i>, </i>5&nbsp;-&nbsp;9 September, 2011.The objective of this research was to study the effect of high pressure processing (HPP) on the quality, physiology and microstructure of avocado slices. Avocado slices were subjected to HPP (High Pressure Processing) treatment with pressures of 200 to 600 MPa and durations of 3-10 min. The samples were examined immediately after treatment to evaluate changes in colour profile, polyphenoloxidase (PPO) activity, and changes in microstructure, respiration rate and ethylene production measured immediately after treatment. Flesh colour was affected to some extent, with L (lightness) and C (chroma) values decreasing after HPP treatment. However, these changes were not evident to the eye. HPP dramatically reduced respiration rate and ethylene production 1 hour after treatment, and, after 17 hours at 20°C, almost complete elimination was observed after treatment at higher pressures. HPP was found to increase PPO activity and activity increased with higher pressure exposure. Microscope observation (Cryo-SEM) showed changes in the structure of the cell wall, disruption of the cellular network and coalescence of oil vesicles at 600 MPa. The results of this study have shown that HPP has dramatic and potentially beneficial effects in terms of reducing respiration rate and ethylene production of avocado slices. Effects on colour, while measurable, were not readily apparent to the eye. Further work is required to examine the effects on shelf life of avocado slices.</p>
