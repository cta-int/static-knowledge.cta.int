						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>World Watch Institute's 'Nourishing the Planet' project describes another little known food crop with an untapped potential for securing food security. Giant swamp taro (<i>Cyrtosperma chamissonis</i>) is more abundant on Pacific atolls than its cousin, the taro (<i>Colocasia esculenta</i>), but it is much less commercially available. Its traditional cultivation is labour intensive and dependent upon a consistently saturated environment, which makes it practical to grow only in small, marshy plots. Swamp taro is a native plant of the Philippines that has dozens of varieties thriving on most of the tropical islands in the Pacific. Giant swamp taro is grown and harvested in small patches for its underground tubers, called corms. Atoll farmers often grow giant swamp taro as part of complex polycultures, in the shade of larger trees. Researchers consider the potential of giant swamp taro to be largely untapped, partly because it is not often studied by researchers and techniques for improving the plant's cultivation have not been developed.

					<p>An international team of researchers have finished a global empirical study that suggests that preservation of plant biodiversity is crucial to buffer negative effects of climate change and desertification in drylands. The results of this study indicate that the ability for ecosystems to maintain multiple functions, such as carbon storage and build-up of nutrient pools is enhanced by an increase in the number of plant species and reduced by the rise in average annual temperature, in drylands worldwide. This study is the first to explicitly evaluate such relationships in ecosystems at a global scale.

					<p>A recent study by UK researchers at the University of East Anglia, School of Environmental Sciences, found that a number of threatened species in the developing world are entirely dependent on human agriculture for their survival and that many species, rather than just using farmland to supplement their natural habitat, would actually be driven to extinction without it. Conserving biodiversity by supporting or mimicking traditional farming methods has long been a feature in Europe, but it has rarely been applied in developing countries. Where local communities are threatened by industrial agriculture, which often results in people being thrown off their traditional lands, conservation may be able to provide a win-win solution, helping to safeguard farming livelihoods for local people and for wildlife. In other cases, local communities could receive economic or development benefits in return for continuing valuable farming practices that benefit wildlife.

Field research and collecting in conjunction with the Vascular Flora of the Marquesas Islands and ‘Flore de la Polynesie française’ projects have yielded 62 new species of ferns and flowering plants bringing the total native species to 360. 18 of them are newly described and illustrated in a special issue of PhytoKeys. The new findings were made by researchers from the National Tropical Botanical Garden (David H. Lorence) and Smithsonian Institution (Warren L. Wagner), in collaboration with French IRD and French Polynesian researchers. &quot;Intensive field work has revealed that most of these new species are extremely rare and localized endemics, often confined to a single island&quot;, senior project leader David Lorence said. Many are known only from one or two localities harboring intact native vegetation that have so far escaped pressures from invasive plant species and feral animals&quot;, Lorence added.

	The book <i>Women’s Knowledge: Traditional Medicine and Nature</i> was launched at the International Workshop on Bioprocessing, Policy and Practice: Conservation and use of Medicinal plants of the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) of the Indian Ocean and Madagascar (20-22 April, 2011 - Ebène, Mauritius).The Islands of Reunion, Mauritius and Rodrigues (Indian Ocean) have their own unique medical traditions. These medical traditions have emerged from multiple origins through a process of creolisation, but they are also closely tied to the natural world in which they have adapted and evolved. They thus provide a key to understanding the wider societies, which are engaged in a constant dialectic between tradition and modernity. Beginning at the end of the Seventeenth Century, these islands were gradually populated by populations originating from Europe, Madagascar, Africa, India, China, even Polynesia and Australia. The interchange between the medical traditions originating from each of these places has given rise to a common knowledge, transmitted largely by women.This book brings to our attention the knowledge of medicinal plants and medical practices of these women, with special focus on childbirth. It also considers the place of medicinal knowledge within these evolving societies who are actively confronting the threats and opportunities that globalization poses to local identities.</p>

Increasingly, research has indicated that in more risky production environments, genetic variation within species and within population increases the ability to respond to the increasing challenges of environmental stress. This paper analyses the role of banana diversity in reducing yield losses associated with biophysical production constraints in Uganda. A damage abatement framework is applied to enable estimation of the contribution of both direct and indirect inputs to the banana yield per unit of area. Results indicate that banana diversity contributes positively to reducing yield losses caused by biophysical constraints, particularly pests and diseases, but trade-offs exist. High banana diversity also has a significant but negative direct impact on banana yields. These trade-offs imply that while banana diversity should be promoted for its risk-reducing effects, its adoption beyond what farmers are practicing will largely depend on their objectives, access to alternative abatement agents, and their ability to bear risk.(Source: Kwikiriza, N., Katungi, E., and Horna, D.; IFPRI, IFPRI Discussion Paper 01051, Environment and Production Technology Division)</p>

A pilot project to see if cash crops can be grown in the salty ground of India's coastal areas has been launched. Dr Selvam - who works for the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation, which runs the project - said the aim was to see whether sea water could be considered a social resource, and if so in what way it could be used to increase food production. The project area will house dozens of species of halophytes - or salt-loving plants - that can be used for producing cash crops.
Halophytes can be used to produce edible oils, medicines, vegetables, and cattle and fish feed. Saline water plants can also be used to produce fine chemicals, biofuels and even building materials. Field studies conducted in the US and East Africa have suggested that halophytes such as sea asparagus can be grown as commercial crops. Backers of the scheme say it could transform agricultural production in coastal areas which are becoming increasingly saline not only in India but in other parts of the world as well.(Source: BBC, 11 January 2011)</p>

	Biodiversity International ‘Seeds for Needs’ project aims to work with farmers to identify varieties of their most important crops that are adapted to cope with variation in climate. The project in Ethiopia, in partnership with the Institute of Biodiversity Conservation in Addis Ababa, will work with around 200 vulnerable women farmers at two target sites where durum wheat and barley are the basis of the farming systems. The project will develop a unique framework that combines three vital streams: available knowledge of the diversity of durum wheat and barley from a range of sources; an improved understanding of climate-change scenarios in Ethiopia; and the farmers’ own experiences, indigenous knowledge and adaptation strategies. ‘Seeds for Needs’ is also being rolled out in Papua New Guinea. The project is working with genebanks and local partners, including communities and women’s groups, to identify sweet potato and taro varieties that can withstand extremes of temperature and rainfall as well as differences in the salt content of the soil and predicted shifts in pests and diseases. Local farming communities will be mobilized to apply their traditional knowledge, and they will be active participants in the research to identify suitable varieties and then test them. After testing, the best-performing and most adaptable varieties will be distributed to farming communities for multiplication with the help of local agribusinesses.

	On 26 October 2010, the FAO launched the 2nd State of the World’s Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture report (SoWPGR-2). This report provides a comprehensive overview of recent trends in Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (PGRFA) conservation and use around the world. It is based on information gathered from more than 100 countries, as well as from regional and international research and support organizations and academic programmes. The report documents the current status of plant genetic resources diversity, conservation and use, as well as the extent and role of national, regional and international efforts that underpin the contributions of PGRFA to food security. It highlights the most significant changes that have occurred in the sector since 1996, when the first report was produced. The SoWPGR-2 provides the basis for the updating of the Global Plan of Action for the Conservation and Sustainable Utilization of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (GPA).

	Farmers and crop scientists worldwide are engaged in an ambitious new effort to add 3,000 yam samples to international genebanks with the aim of saving the diversity of yam, according to the Global Crop Diversity Trust. Benin already has sent 847 yam samples to the IITA, Ibadan, Nigeria. At IITA, the tubers will be grown out in fields, and cuttings taken for conservation in the lab as part of an international collection that already contains about 3,200 yam samples from West Africa. The yam project is part of a broader effort involving major crop species worldwide in which the Trust is helping partners in 68 countries—including 38 in Africa alone—rescue and regenerate more than 80,000 endangered accessions in crop collections and send duplicates to international genebanks and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in the Arctic Circle. For yams, reproduced through vegetative propagation, IITA offers the only long-term form of conservation. Conserving the crop requires extracting tissue in the laboratory and freezing it in liquid nitrogen. However, the technique demands careful research and a staff of dedicated skilled technicians.

					<p>At the 5th African Agriculture Science Week, hosted by the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA) experts from the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) told researchers that urgent action is needed to stop the rapid and alarming loss of genetic diversity of African livestock, the livelihood of 70 percent of rural Africans and a treasure-trove of drought- and disease-resistant animals. On the basis of a new analysis, the scientists were urged to expand their efforts to identify and preserve the unique traits, particularly in West Africa, of the continent's rich array of cattle, sheep, goats and pigs developed over several millennia but now under siege. ILRI's push to preserve Africa's indigenous livestock is part of a broader effort to improve productivity on African farms through what is known as 'landscape genomics'. Landscape genomics involves, among other things, sequencing the genomes of different livestock varieties from many regions and looking for the genetic signatures associated with their suitability to a particular environment.

					<p>An international team of researchers from Tanzania, UK and USA has developed a model that suggests degradation of tropical forests occurs in series of ‘waves’. The team hopes the model will help manage forests as vital carbon sinks and limits the loss of biodiversity. The researchers said an economic theory was used to provide a general model to predict patterns of tree loss. The team also developed their model to gauge what impact forest degradation had on ‘public good’ services, such as carbon storage and biodiversity. They did this by recording what species of trees were in a particular area of the study, and what size the individual trees were. The model can be used to understand the impact of forest degradation in other sub-Saharan nations in Africa. (Source: BBC News, 3 August 2010)</p>

					<p>Developing countries rich in plants and animals but poor in financial and technical resources refused to make binding commitments to halt the unraveling of the planet's biological infrastructure at the close of a major meeting Friday at the U.N.'s African headquarters in Nairobi. Rates of biodiversity loss - as measured by reduction in abundance and extent of species - increased in most parts of the world, according to the Global Biodiversity Outlook 3 (GBO 3) released at the start of the meeting. The specific details of the 2020 target were contested and watered down so they were somewhat less ambitious than what the GBO 3 and the CBD's own expert and technical committee had advised. The Strategic Plan calls for a 50-fold increase in funding. Delegates from developed countries objected saying they did not have the authority to make such large financial commitments.

					<p>Virtually every protected area in Africa suffers from invasive species threatening biodiversity and peoples' livelihoods, a meeting called to address the problem has heard. Africa's protected biodiversity areas are under increasing threat from the species introduced — usually through human activities — to areas outside their natural range where they damage biodiversity, agriculture and human health. Lack of scientific research and institutional capacities contribute to the situation, and thus little is known about the invasive species that are present, what impact they have and how best to manage them, the meeting heard.

					<p>Representatives from close to 90 countries gathered in Busan, South Korea, in the second week of June 2010. They have approved the formation of a new organization to monitor the ecological state of the planet and its natural resources. Dubbed the <a href="http://www.ipbes.net/" target="_self">Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services </a>(IPBES), the new entity will likely meet for the first time in 2011 and operate much like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). According to the document approved June 11, IPBES will conduct periodic assessments of the diversity of life on earth and its 'ecosystem services'—those outputs of ecosystems, such as clean fresh water, fish, game, timber and a stable climate, that benefit humankind. These assessments will answer questions about how much biodiversity is declining and what the implications of extinctions and ecosystem change are for humanity. Assessments will take place on global, regional and sub-regional scales. (Source: Nature News, 12 June 2010).</p>

	Scientists are reviving long-ignored African rice varieties, to cut dependence on Asian varieties that may be less able to withstand the impacts of climate change on the poorest continent, a report said on 21 May. Historically, scientists have focused on breeding useful traits such as disease resistance from African rice into Asian rice. Now the focus is on the reverse – using African rice as the basic crop and improving it with Asian genes. ‘African rice was initially ignored by mainstream research’, said Koichi Futakuchi, a scientist at Africa Rice Center (AfricaRice) in a statement. ‘Now, for the first time, we're reversing the gene flow.’ (Source: Reuters, 21 May 2010) </p>
