They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	<p>Approximately 10,500 years ago, Man made his first attempts at agriculture and they proved successful, as it was possible to grow what he needed. However, there was a lot of trial and just about as much error. Mobility was limited, very limited by today’s standards, and thus the choice of species to experiment with was limited to those that grew or were readily available and, not every species was suitable for domestication. The implication of this is that successful domestication efforts depended on a high level of available biodiversity! As trade developed, and agricultural biodiversity started to be exchanged, societies that had greatest access proved to be the most successful. </p>

<p>Agricultural innovation increased as new crops were taken into cultivation and gained acceptance. This went on until around the early 1900s when oil was being commercialized, as it was abundant and cheap and led to a new agricultural impetus. In the 1960s, the “Green Revolution” further amplified mechanized farming and the use of fertilizers, pesticides and high-yielding hybrid crop varieties. </p><p>The scenario at present is one of an ever-increasing human population fed by a highly efficient, agricultural industry in which wide disparities exist with respect to access to food. It is estimated that 13,000 food crop varieties exist worldwide; this is some biodiversity! However, only 4,800 of these are regularly cultivated, and amongst these, 4 species alone represent almost 50% of total food production (wheat, maize, rice and potato), while 18 others represent 80% of the remaining total (J . Weber, directeur de l’Institut français de biodiversité (IFB). Communication to Cirad, August 2006). With increased globalization, these diversity numbers are expected to drop as our agricultural basis is becoming dependent on fewer genetic varieties.</p><p>Having witnessed the 2008 food and energy security crises, one wonders what will happen to our ability to feed the world when oil is no longer cheap. Growing demands, fuelled by an ever-growing human population is one problem; also, if we take into account the argument that we are approaching “peak oil”, after which world oil production will steadily decrease, what will happen to mechanical equipment used by farmers and those involved in distribution, and when fertilizers and pesticides are no longer available? Add to that the uncertainty posed by global warming and it becomes obvious that we can no longer assume that farm production will continue to increase. </p><p>The challenge we are facing in the coming decades is how to feed the world’s hungry and make use of available agrobiodiversity. This is now more than ever one of the major objectives for the national and international scientific and development community, and society as a whole. Innovation is called for and it is necessary to rethink agricultural production techniques, designing them to become ecologically more intense, and put biodiversity and genetic agricultural diversity to the forefront again.</p><p>The decrease in biodiversity has probably never been as acute as it is presently, barring past cataclysmic events. One could even describe it as a “biodiversity crisis“ when considering the loss of populations, species and even ecosystems. And yet this biodiversity was our starting block and will always remain our “bank” to tap into when the need arises. History teaches us about numerous documented cases of flourishing societies that collapsed after they depleted their local biodiversity resources (Easter Island is one of the extreme examples). We cannot allow ourselves to make that mistake again, especially as the main victims of biodiversity loss and global warming will be vulnerable and even poorer populations. The erosion of the biological diversity of this planet is a real peril for rural populations, who have to act now in order to conserve their agricultural and biological resources. For this to happen, a dynamic conservation approach, that allows <i>in situ</i> and <i>ex situ </i>conservation, needs to be researched. </p><p>This will help rethink agricultural production techniques, founding them on sound ecological intensification principles that will enable better resource management. The exhaustion of mineral resources (linked to monocultures and overexploitation), soil erosion (mainly caused by repeated use), microfauna losses and the reduction of biotic interactions are all causes of a loss of productivity and biodiversity.</p><p>We must therefore think of alternative cropping systems - combining various species in the same space or in the same field alternately - maintaining the biodiversity within cultivated and uncultivated plots. Ecological interactions from species that develop within multiple ecosystems (animal, vegetable and mineral) guarantee good ecosystem health. Some methods and techniques are already being tested, with promising preliminary results, such as cropping systems based on direct seeding on permanent plant cover (SCV) or agroforestry systems, another example of sustainable agriculture, which combine food crops and trees on the same plot. There is need to speed up the research efforts at national and international levels.</p><p>SCV systems are based on the absence of tillage, crop rotations, integration of agriculture and livestock, on the permanent protection of soil against erosion by vegetation, living or in a state of decomposition. They hold much interest for sustainable agriculture: in good conditions, the commercial value of product yields is maintained, and the total production of biomass is increased (from 23 to over 30 t/ha of dry biomass per year). This additional biomass production can trap nutrients that would otherwise be lost by drainage into the groundwater and streams, and provide a litter that will protect the soil against erosion, reduce water losses by evaporation and runoff, enhance soil organic matter, contributing to its biological activity and gradually restoring the nutrients back to the plant matter. The result is ultimately a reduced reliance on chemical fertilizers, increased carbon sequestration in soils and reduced emissions of greenhouse gas emissions related to operations of tillage, particularly within mechanized agriculture. An important part of vital ecological services are thus rendered from the functional complementarities between species on a plot and within the soil. One finds in this agriculture system an interaction between soil macro- and microfauna and dynamic biogeochemical processes similar in that respect to those observed under natural forest conditions (see <a href="http://agroecologie.cirad.fr/librairie_virtuelle" target="_self">CIRAD’s Agroecologie resource</a>). </p><p>Agroforestry systems are another example to study, develop and promote. Associating trees to farming practices is an idea as old as agriculture itself, practiced in fallow land agriculture, such as Ethiopian and Indonesian agroforestry in coffee plantations, Normandy and the wooded grounds of the Sahel. As it combines agriculture and &quot;tree planting”, and is mainly governed by smallholder farmers in tropical surroundings. Agroforestry has implications within ecological, economic and social processes that differ from those of regular agriculture or forestry taken separately. The ecological changes brought along by agroforestry, not only in environmental terms, but also for social organization, farm economics and management and landscape structure, are extremely important (as noted in various papers at the 2nd World Agroforestry Symposium, 2009). </p><p>However, SCV and agroforestry systems pose a number of problems, including the need to manage the fragile competition between plants and commercial crop cover, or between food and tree crops (for agroforestry systems). Another difficulty encountered within SCV systems is the use of herbicides to control weeds. The introduction of a &quot;cover crop&quot; designed to produce excessive biomass introduces additional technical components and variables and switching to direct seeding mulch requires investment in appropriate mechanical and methodological techniques. Innovations that profoundly change the entire operating system and not only the management of plots are likely to be very important in the future. This requires the will of farmers to commit themselves to the financial capacity to support a transitional phase where the economic performance of these systems is limited because they require some learning in order to be maximized. Moreover, they are not very accessible to poor smallholder farmers, as additional production from biomass is primarily allocated to the goals of economic survival in the short-term, rather than as investment in the long-term protection of the ecosystem or progressive soil improvement. This explains why, until now, these systems in the tropics were mainly developed in areas where properly remunerated entrepreneurial agriculture dominates market and efforts to spread the techniques across Africa in less-organized agricultural zones have remained largely unsuccessful. This suggests that the political and scientific community need to support farmers in and provide advice and incentives to minimize the technical and economic risks. </p><p>At the Rio Summit of 1992, 168 countries agreed to improve the management and promotion of biological resources. Consequently, the Convention of Biological Diversity was signed the year after: an agreement which regards biodiversity as a valuable technical and natural resource. A French study (Zaharia, 2008) conducted in 2006 and 2007 by the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA’s Unité Mixte de Recherche de Génétique Végétale du Moulon), the French Centre of Scientific Research (CNRS, centre Koyre for History of Science), the french Ecole Normale Supérieure (ENS) and the Réseau Semences Paysannes (Peasant Seed Network) could attract the attention of farmer organizations and cooperatives in ACP countries. The study considered farm management interests solely in terms of conservation of agricultural biodiversity. Funded in part by the French Bureau des Resources Génétiques (Office of Genetic Resources), this research programme has provided lessons for the conservation and renewal of agricultural biodiversity, particularly within the interest that exists to promote reciprocal trade between conservation centres’ <i>ex situ</i> management and farming, because the diversity in cultivated fields is greater than that stored in collections. Promoting such exchanges seems very interesting in terms of maintaining biodiversity in countries which encounter such problems. Indeed, it has an important role in production, and fulfils its function as a future genetic diversity reserve as it allows cultivated stocks to respond to possible narrowing of genetic diversity, brought along generally by environmental and climatic effects.</p><p>Conserving biological diversity and more specifically agricultural biodiversity needs to be a dynamic enterprise, comprising both <i>in situ</i> and <i>ex situ</i> techniques. <i>Ex situ</i> conservation includes the conservation of dried seeds, stored at low temperatures in internationally managed collections (static conservation) and a more high-tech solution such as cryogenically frozen genetic material ; while a dynamic conservation consists of field growth and cultivation of genetically heterogeneous varieties, and allowing the previously sowed fields to evolve in a natural way ; <i>in situ </i>conservation is defined in the International Treaty of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization in 2001, as species conservation in the environment for which they were found to have developed their unique characteristics. Techniques should be a combination of high-level international efforts trying to safeguard the crops that feed the world, together with grassroots mechanisms, and a real dynamic conservation effort should also include simply “allowing” cultivated indigenous resources to be farmed instead of deliberately replacing them with high-tech “miracle” varieties. </p><p>The poorest and most vulnerable people will be the first impacted by a failure to conserve and make use of the wide agro-biodiversity. We must think about how to change the modes of production and support countries in their efforts. We must switch from current production practices, based mainly on the severe disruption of the environment to bring in the needs of industry especially small and vulnerable farming communities, a production method that is &quot;respectful of the environment”, and does not use up all the ecosystem potential. Agriculture as it has been practiced since the middle of the twentieth century cannot both meet the needs of a world population rapidly increasing and prevent the degradation of agricultural productivity unless the scientific community provides some leadership on the priority actions to bring about the necessary changes. Conservation alone will not be enough to cure current and potential problems. We need a paradigm shift that will take into account not only (agricultural) biodiversity in its entirety but the propagation of innovative agricultural systems, disparaged and relatively unknown for now, that is systems that are less based on monocultures, are less energy-dependent, that conserve the soil, and that are resilient enough to deal with climate shifts while giving hope to the human race.</p><p>
