						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Stanford scientists are calling for investments in small-scale irrigation projects and hydrologic mapping to help buffer the growers from the erratic weather and poor crop yields that are expected to worsen with climate change in West Africa. The researchers partnered with the Solar Electric Light Fund (SELF) to measure economic and nutritional impacts of solar-powered drip-irrigated gardens on villages in West Africa's Sudano-Sahel region. They worked in two northern Benin villages with women's cooperative agricultural groups to install three of such irrigation systems. Drip irrigation conserves water by delivering it directly to the base of plants and the technique also reduces fertilizer runoff. However, for smallholder irrigation projects to be successful, NGOs and governments need to prioritize detailed hydrologic mapping in the region to produce geophysical surveys and map an quantify water sources such as groundwater, rainwater, surface water and artesian wells.

	The Agricultural Development and Value Chain Enhancement Programme is to carry out a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping exercise of rice, soya and maize fields in the Northern, Upper East and Upper West regions. The programme is to help farmers to calculate their plot sizes for production, planning and resource allocation. It will also involve 53 students who will be trained as Geographic Information System surveyors, from the University of Ghana, Cape Coast University, University of Development Studies and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology.

	A novel methodology has been developed for the creation of a cropland map for Africa through the combination of five existing land cover products: GLC-2000, MODIS Land Cover, GlobCover, MODIS Crop Likelihood, and AfriCover. A synergy map is created which reflects the probability that a given map pixel is cropland. The cropland map is then calibrated with national and sub-national crop statistics using a novel approach. Preliminary validation of the map was undertaken and the results are presented. The resulting cropland map has an accuracy of 83%, which is higher than the accuracy of any of the individual maps.(<a href="http://www.servirglobal.net/africa/tabid/205/Article/1034/cropland-for-sub-saharan-africa-using-five-land-cover-data-sets.aspx" target="_blank">Servir via GSDI Newsletter</a>, 10/2011)</p>

	The excessive use of irrigation water has resulted in serious environmental concerns in many dry-land countries, where rising demand has deteriorated groundwater resources, depleted aquifers, and accelerated saltwater intrusion. Scientists in Spain are working on new technologies to classify and monitor irrigated crops with a goal of promoting sustainable agricultural practices. The field studies the researchers designed were to evaluate the potential of multispectral reflectance and seven vegetation indices in the visible and near-infrared spectral range for discriminating and classifying bare soil and several horticultural irrigated crops. The research is the first step of a broader project with the overall goal of using satellite imagery with high spatial and multispectral resolutions for mapping irrigated crops.

	University of British Columbia researchers have produced the first map of the world outlining the ease of fluid flow through the planet's porous surface rocks and sediments. The maps and data, published in Geophysical Research Letters (January 2011), could help improve water resource management and climate modelling, and eventually lead to new insights into a range of geological processes.Using recent world-wide lithology (rock type) results from researchers at the University of Hamburg (Germany) and Utrecht University (The Netherlands); the authors were able to map permeability across the globe to depths of approximately 100 metres. Typical permeability maps have only dealt with the top one to two metres of soil, and only across smaller areas.
 A better understanding of large scale permeability of rock and sediment is critical for water resource management. Groundwater represents approximately 99 % of the fresh, unfrozen water on earth. Groundwater also feeds surface water bodies and moistens the root zone of terrestrial plants.(Source: Science Daily, 25 Jan. 2011) </p>

	Stanford agricultural scientist David Lobell and researchers at CIMMYT report in the inaugural issue of <i>Nature Climate Change</i> (<a href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.nature.com/nclimate/index.html</a>) that a clear negative effect of warming on maize production was evident in experimental crop trial data conducted in Africa by the organization and its partners from 1999 to 2007. Led by Lobell, the researchers combined data from 20,000 trials in sub-Saharan Africa with weather data recorded at stations scattered across the region. They found that a temperature rise of a single degree Celsius would cause yield losses for 65 percent of the present maize-growing region in Africa - provided the crops received the optimal amount of rainfall. The data recorded at the yield testing sites did not include weather information. Instead, the researchers used data gathered from weather stations all over sub-Saharan Africa. Although the stations were operated by different organizations, all data collection was organized by the World Meteorological Organization, so the methods used were consistent. Lobell then took the available weather data and interpolated between recording stations to infer what the weather would have been like at the test sites. By merging the weather and crop data, the researchers could examine climate impacts.Source: Sciencedaily, 14 Mar. 2011, see <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110313160025.htm" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110313160025.htm </a>and The Economist, 17 Mar. 2011, see <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18386161" target="_blank">http://www.economist.com/node/18386161</a></p>

	The FAST Maize yield forecast at GAUL1 level for the Southern Africa region as per March 1st 2011, has been produced by <a href="http://www.ears.nl/index.php" target="_blank">EARS</a>.EARS provides systems and data services for monitorng climate, water &amp; food (Climate and Photosynthesis monitoring; Crop yield and River flow forecasting).The document (to download below) provides a preliminary forecast of crop yield expected at the end of the current (2010-2011) growing season in Southern Africa. It contains a series of crop yield raster maps produced from the most recent satellite images of Southern Africa.Forecasts are provided from halfway the growing season (70 growing days). Although at that time the most critical stages of crop development have passed, the final outcome may still be subject to some change depending on how the second half of the season proceeds. Our forecasts are updated with the most recent satellite data available and distributed through email on a personal subscription basis every ten days.<b>About FAST</b>&quot;FAST crop yield forecasting service for Africa&quot;
In the framework of the GMES project &quot;Global Monitoring for Food Security&quot; (GMFS), lead by VITO (Belgium), EARS has provided its &quot;Food Assessment by Satellite Technology&quot; (FAST) service. FAST products and crop yield early warning bulletins were created on the basis of Meteosat data and provided to FAO-GIEWS and WFP-VAM. These products were provided timely before their Crop and Food Supply Assessment Missions to countries in Africa with upcoming food problems.

	South Africa’s Farmers Weekly reports that satellite images could soon be used in the country to quantify veld production estimate livestock carrying capacity and help farmers plan fodder flow. The technology used for satellite imagery is widely available and accurate and farmers can benefit from it, said Tony Palmer and Alan Short of the Agricultural Research Council’s Animal Production Institute (ARC-API). Once the technique of converting satellite data into an accurate picture of plant growth (and so of grazing capacity) is refined, researchers can give farmers real-time plant-production estimates for their veld. This will be invaluable for fodder-flow planning in livestock areas. Regional maps will be available from the agriculture department’s Agricultural Geo-referenced Information System (AGIS) at <a href="http://www.agis.agric.za/agisweb/agis.html" target="_blank">www.agis.agric.za</a>. These maps will help government support farmers during exceptional circumstances, such as droughts. (Source: GIS Development; 11 November 2010).</p>

	Produced by African Smallholder Farmers Group with the assistance of Practical Action and other NGOs, 'Africa’s Smallholder Farmers: Approaches that work for viable livelihoods' emphasises the need to support and prioritise smallholder farmers in Africa, and to provide the right kind of support that enables them to strengthen agriculture and livelihoods over the long term (instead of focus on short-term productivity gains). It contains nine case studies of successful approaches, including three from Practical Action's African offices. The African Smallholder Farmers Group is a consortium of agencies whose aim is to promote effective support to smallholder farmers in Africa by sharing lessons and information, collecting evidence of what works and highlighting the important of smallholder farmers to developing country and donor governments. <a href="http://practicalaction.org/reducing-vulnerability/docs/ia1/asfg-africa-smallholder-farmers.pdf%20" target="_blank">View PDF</a> (Source: Zunia, 23 August 2010)</p>

	A unique partnership between NASA and organisations in Africa and Europe, including the Joint Research Centre’s (JRC) Institute for Environment and Sustainability (IES), has sent more than 30 terabytes of free Earth science satellite data to South African researchers to support sustainable development and environmental applications in Africa. This led to an agreement between JRC-IES and CISR in July 2008 to facilitate the interaction and exchange of staff, knowledge, data and software. NASA became involved in the collaboration in 2009, which culminated in a shipment of most of the data this summer. The data are from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), managed by NASA. This transfer of data to a distribution centre in Africa will make it widely accessible to African users who have not been able to remotely download the large data files because of limitations in the continent's internet infrastructure.

					<p>A new European Earth observation satellite will be launched in the early hours of Monday the 2nd of November 2009 from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northern Russia. The European Space Agency Soil Moisture &amp; Ocean Salinity satellite aims to measure both moisture levels in the earth's soils and the saltiness (salinity) of the surface waters of the world's oceans from space for the very first time. British scientists and engineers have been involved in the mission from the start. Global measurements of salinity and soil moisture will improve our understanding of how water is transported around the earth, and how it circulates around the oceans, and lead to more accurate weather forecasts and climate simulations.

					<p>For the first time worldwide, free and ready-to-use high-resolution satellite data is now available to monitor forests and help reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. The monitoring system has been launched by FAO and other partners as part of the Global Forest Resources Assessment. This brings a revolution to the forest monitoring field. Never before have data of this kind been provided directly to users in developing countries. Monitoring will be cheaper, more accurate and transparent for countries that want to participate in reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. The world's forests are in the spotlight as talks for a new climate change deal move towards an agreement on how to achieve reduced emissions from forests next December in Copenhagen, Denmark. A mechanism for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) would be a breakthrough in the fight against climate change and represents one of the areas where most progress is expected in Copenhagen. It is the first time that a global forest scheme has the potential to generate such a magnitude of benefits for developing countries. A REDD mechanism would not only bring a reduced impact on climate but also much needed resources to improve livelihoods, conservation efforts and food security.

	A mobile phone application will help professional and “citizen” scientists collect and analyse data from “in the field”, anywhere in the world. The EpiCollect software collates data from certain mobiles - on topics such as disease spread or the occurrence of rare species - in a web-based database. The data is statistically analysed and plotted on maps that are instantly available to those same phones. The approach is outlined in the open-access journal PLoS ONE. The software has been developed for so-called smartphones that run Google's Android open-source operating system. Researchers can report back to the EpiCollect database with results from experiments they do in the field, and “citizen scientists” can send back photos or videos of certain species from their own backyards. The phones’ GPS system automatically logs users’ locations, and the data is then plotted by location using Google Maps. Then anyone can access the database online, or from their phone.

	The use of remote sensing and satellite imaging looks set to become more widespread in South Africa as sustainable agriculture and natural resource management become more urgent in the face of climate change. Remote sensing, a technique that uses recorded or real-time wireless sensing devices to collect information on an object or phenomenon, is proving more successful in South Africa than other African countries for two reasons: South Africa has the required telecommunications network infrastructure to support remote sensing, and its higher internet capacity means that information can be transmitted consistently and in a timely manner. &quot;For the past decade we have used remote sensing to evaluate and monitor land use, and its impact on the land. We also use remote sensing for mapping land cover and ecosystems, and for monitoring drought outlooks,&quot; a specialist researcher for the Limpopo Department of Agriculture, Brilliant Mareme Petja, told IRIN. Scientists at the Department of Agriculture in Limpopo Province have begun using remote sensing techniques to monitor the impact of climate change, with a view to mitigating and adapting to altered conditions. &quot;Remote sensor data combined with meteorological data from the rainfall stations enables us to demarcate areas that are more likely to be affected by climate change,&quot; Petja said.

					<p>It has been assumed that global warming would cause an expansion of the world's deserts, but now some scientists are predicting a contrary scenario in which water and life slowly reclaim these arid places. They think vast, dry regions like the Sahara might soon begin shrinking. The evidence is limited and definitive conclusions are impossible to reach but recent satellite pictures of North Africa seem to show areas of the Sahara in retreat. It could be that an increase in rainfall has caused this effect. Farouk el-Baz, director of the Centre for Remote Sensing at Boston University, believes the Sahara is experiencing a shift from dryer to wetter conditions. &quot;It's not greening yet. But the desert expands and shrinks in relation to the amount of energy that is received by the Earth from the Sun, and this over many thousands of years,&quot; Mr el-Baz said. Remote sensing - radar-imaging from space - began in 1981 and showed scientists what was going on under the Saharan sand. The aquifer, a collection of reservoirs trapped underground between layers of permeable rock, was studied and mapped for the first time. Tapping into this supply has meant deserts areas can, with skill and judgement, be transformed into farmable land. (Source: BBC World Service, 16 July 2009)</p>

					<p>Weather experts have revised downwards Zimbabwe’s projected maize output for the 2008/09 season, raising the spectre of another long year of biting hunger and begging bowls in what was once one of Africa’s bread-baskets. Remote sensing experts at Netherlands-based weather forecasting body EARS said Zimbabwe is one of a few southern African countries likely to record poor maize harvests this year due to uneven rainfall patterns. Agricultural experts, including those from the Southern African Development Community (SADC), have said lack of or the untimely availability of inputs was to blame for the continuous decline in Zimbabwe’s maize production.
