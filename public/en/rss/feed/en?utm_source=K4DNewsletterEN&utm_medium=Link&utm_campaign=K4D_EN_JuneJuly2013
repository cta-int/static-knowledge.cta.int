      <title>CTA Top 20 Innovations that Benefit Smallholder Farmers</title>
      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/CTA-S-T-programme/Commissioned-articles-2016/CTA-Top-20-Innovations-that-Benefit-Smallholder-Farmers</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years, CTA has contributed to building ACP capacity to understand innovation processes, strengthen the agricultural innovation system and embed innovation thinking in agricultural and rural development strategies. The CTA Top 20 Innovations project set out to prove that innovation is taking place in ACP agriculture and in the process has demonstrated that smallholder farmers are beneficiaries as well as partners in agricultural innovation. The CTA Top 20 Innovations that were selected from among the 251 submissions that had been received from 49 countries showcase the ingenuity of numerous stakeholders who are innovating and by their collective efforts are making a difference in the livelihoods of ACP smallholder farmers and their families.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Enhancing private sector engagement in agricultural research and development in eastern Africa</title>
      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/Participatory-approaches-in-ARD/Feature-articles/Enhancing-private-sector-engagement-in-agricultural-research-and-development-in-eastern-Africa</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A survey of private sector firms in eastern Africa revealed that 65% of them did not allocate any budgets for research. Over 50% of the firms indicated that they responded to calls for collaborative research whenever they were advertised. Of the firms interviewed, 97% indicated that they knew research institutions that could address some of their business challenges. The three priority suggestions by private firms on how to improve uptake and commercialization of improved technologies were: involvement of end users in the research process; establishment of frameworks for regular interactions between researchers and industry players; and awareness creation and training for end users.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Intellectual property rights in plant breeding and the impact on agricultural innovation</title>
      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/Intellectual-property/Feature-articles/Intellectual-property-rights-in-plant-breeding-and-the-impact-on-agricultural-innovation</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In plant breeding, two types of intellectual property rights (IPRs) play a major role; plant breeders’ rights (PBRs), developed between 1900 and 1950; and patent rights, which emerged with the rise of modern biotechnology. This paper examines the impact of both systems on breeders, farmers and agricultural innovation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The ethics of animal production and sustainability</title>
      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/Commodities/Livestock/Feature-articles/The-ethics-of-animal-production-and-sustainability</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last 50 years, the ethical values around animal production have steadily changed, mainly through widespread adoption of industrial and intensive practices. Industrialisation and pro-productionism have taken precedence over agrarian values and farming methods emphasising material prosperity. This has displaced the ethos of independent, community farmers and pastoralists as stewards of the land and farm animals.&amp;nbsp; Food safety, quality control, animal welfare and traceability practices are overarching norms and have become sites of political and economic contest, as producers and multinational agribusinesses seek to maximise product quality and economic profitability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bio-economy and green growth: Integrating farmers’ knowledge for a public goods-oriented approach</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The bio-economy and green growth have been on the international policy agenda for several years. Two main views prevail concerning the ‘bio-economy’ – an industrial perspective, and the other a public goods perspective – each promoting different futures for agricultural systems and farmers’ roles; some address both perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tuna, coastal fisheries, beche-de-mer and aquaculture development in the Western and Central Pacific: current issues and future needs</title>
      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/CTA-S-T-programme/Commissioned-articles-2016/Tuna-coastal-fisheries-beche-de-mer-and-aquaculture-development-in-the-Western-and-Central-Pacific-current-issues-and-future-needs</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article gives a personal overview of the current status of tuna, coastal fisheries, beche-de-mer (BDM) and aquaculture in the Western and Central Pacific. It highlights issues associated with the sustainable management of resources at a scientific and at a policy level. Recommendations are made for a fisheries/tuna research centre, more effective management of coastal fisheries, and better planning for aquaculture development. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

	Millennium Development Goal No. 1 (MDG1), agreed by the international community in 1990, stated that both the proportion of people in extreme poverty and the proportion who suffer from hunger should be halved between 1990 and 2015 (MDG targets 1.A and 1.C, respectively). The global agenda for sustainable development features instead a stand-alone goal that goes beyond chronic hunger and brings in the very important concept of nutrition. Moreover, the second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG2) combines food security and nutrition with sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture, and calls for a special focus on small-scale food producers (notably women farmers), recognising their major role in food systems globally. This is a novel approach compared to the MDG agenda.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenya is considered food-insecure, with a general deficit in production, particularly of staple foods; maize, wheat, beans, rice and sugar, and this is supplemented by imported food commodities. Postharvest losses, especially of perishable produce are high, while poor postharvest handling of cereal maize and related products compromises food safety because of aflatoxin contamination putting farm families, livestock and consumers at risk, further exacerbating the food insecurity situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenya’s Agriculture Sector Development Strategy (ASDS) contributed to a restructuring of the agricultural sector and encompasses cross-cutting issues of climate change, youth and gender engagement as well as industrialisation and finance. However, the sector continues to be negatively impacted by several binding constraints.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	Pouring millions of dollars in a research system does not necessarily guarantee good research and useful outputs and development. First and foremost, we need qualified, competent and motivated researchers, with necessary incentives to ensure focus on the research instead of other things. In Tanzania, for example, the number of PhD holders was lower in 2011 compared with 2008. This decline, gives cause for concern, especially given the importance of the agricultural sector and the value of research in addressing present and future challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	The population of Sub-Saharan Africa has been growing at an average annual rate of 2.7% in 2013, compared to 0.7% in 2013 for the USA. In 2014, the populations of Nigeria and Niger grew at annual rates of 2.8% and 3.9%, respectively. At the same time, the economies of many African nations have been growing at an annualized rate approaching 4% and urbanization and life expectancy have also been increasing. These trends have created new pressures, especially for achieving food security, fuelling the need for a more productive, diversified and competitive agri-food sector.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	Agricultural extension systems everywhere are experiencing unprecedented changes and transformations, accompanied with tremendous challenges for all involved. Historically conceived as a public service targeting farming populations with agricultural information and technologies, the private sector and civil society are increasingly playing a role. There are new clients (including the diverse actors in entire agricultural value chains located in urban areas versus the traditional focus on rural farmers; large-scale commercial farmers as opposed to subsistence small-scale farmers, youth, women); and new messages. Despite the problems with public-sector extension systems, private-sector provision will not resolve all of them. Evidence supports pluralistic systems with both public and private actors performing different roles and targeting different extension needs in a coordinated manner. The transition to private sector provision needs careful planning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	The Innovation Platform (InP) has become an attractive approach for supporting agricultural development. An InP is generally established to foster interaction amongst a wide range of stakeholders including producers, researchers, development practitioners and policy-makers, around a shared interest. The stakeholders interact to jointly identify problems and opportunities, seek and apply solutions and learn to stimulate continuous innovation. However, establishment and management are complicated given the multiplicity of actors with diverse objectives and expectations. This article describes how an InP in western Kenya contributed to increased control of banana Xanthomonas wilt (BXW). Several demonstrations were set up to show farmers how the control technologies worked. &amp;nbsp;After couple of months, they told their neighbours about it and this helped in the scaling up of the programme. To enhance access to knowledge and information on BXW control best practices and technologies, additional InPs were formed and used to reach over 6,000 banana farmers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	Innovation has become a buzzword in the realm of international development over the past decade. Major funders such as the United State Agency for International Development (USAID) and United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) support ‘innovation labs’, where resources and expertise are focused on asking new research questions that build on past successes and failures. Non-governmental organisations around the world facilitate and emphasise local innovations to meet local needs, in an effort to generate new ideas that are appropriate and relevant to specific places. These and other approaches to innovation in international development are influenced by the private enterprise model of start-up firms in the information technology sector, where innovation is seen to be a collaborative process that is constantly working to adapt and improve existing things, systems and ideas. As Fabian and Fabricant highlight, however, the orientation toward creative destruction in technology innovation, where change is constant and “failing quickly” yields further innovation, does not reflect the ethical and practical realities of research and programming in international development, where human well-being is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Can we end hunger in the post-2015 frame with food as a commodity? </title>
      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/S-T-Issues/Food-security/Feature-articles/Can-we-end-hunger-in-the-post-2015-frame-with-food-as-a-commodity</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Global hunger statistics, portraying a world that is progressing remarkably, serve to justify the dominant economic ideology (productivism, neoliberalism and privatization of resources). This text provides a careful examination of those data (undernourishment and chronic malnutrition), revealing caveats and biased interpretations. The world is not doing so well under the market-driven industrial food system and the MDG1 on hunger was clearly not achieved. The supply/demand rules will never get rid of hunger, as preached by the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals, since the market does not have incentives to provide food to those who do not have money to pay for such essential resource. We need a paradigm shift and social contract whereby food is considered a commons and nutrition a public good. The food commons are about equity, cooperation, resilience and direct democracy from local to global. This text provides normative and practical elements to navigate to transition towards sustainability that is actually happen in many rural customary societies and urban civic collective actions for food. We all have to re-claim our role as food citizens and not just as food customers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Food security and nutrition in the post-2015 agenda: From MDG 1 to SDG 2 - some new policy challenges and opportunities</title>
      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/S-T-Issues/Food-security/Feature-articles/Food-security-and-nutrition-in-the-post-2015-agenda-From-MDG-1-to-SDG-2-some-new-policy-challenges-and-opportunities</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bettina Prato, Lead Global Engagement Specialist, Strategy and Knowledge Department, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Rome, Italy&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millennium Development Goal No. 1 (MDG1), agreed by the international community in 1990, stated that both the proportion of people in extreme poverty and the proportion who suffer from hunger should be halved between 1990 and 2015 (MDG targets 1.A and 1.C, respectively). The emerging global agenda for sustainable development features instead a stand-alone goal that goes beyond chronic hunger and brings in the very important concept of nutrition. Moreover, the second proposed Sustainable Development Goal (SDG2) combines food security and nutrition with sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture, and calls for a special focus on small-scale food producers (notably women farmers), recognising their major role in food systems globally. This is a novel approach compared to the MDG agenda. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Colleagues:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to present the March/April 2015 issue of the CTA and S&amp;T Knowledge for Development (K4D) e-newsletter. Changes are coming to the K4D web portal and this is the final K4D newsletter. We have, therefore, chosen to capture some of the new thinking and changing dynamics on science, technology and innovation (STI) in agriculture. This is only fitting as STI was the genesis and raison d’être of K4D since it was launched in early 2004. The future looks bright for STI for agriculture and rural development if the momentum is sustained and STI policy and practice are further mainstreamed into national systems which are adequately resourced. Let us, therefore, hope that Queen Elizabeth or some other highly respected national or world leader does not have to ask the experts in the not too distant future ‘&lt;i&gt;How did you get it wrong?’&lt;/i&gt;; ‘&lt;i&gt;How did you miss the signals&lt;/i&gt;?’ if agricultural sector performance does not improve or perhaps drops and millions of smallholder farmers are further impoverished and their families malnourished and displaced.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Changes are coming to K4D website. In our final newsletter, we have captured some of the new thinking and changing dynamics on science, technology and innovation (STI) in agriculture. This is only fitting as STI was the genesis and raison d’être of K4D since it was launched in early 2004. The future looks bright for STI for agriculture and rural development if the momentum is sustained and STI policy and practice are further mainstreamed into national systems which are adequately resourced. Let us, therefore, hope that Queen Elizabeth or some other highly respected national or world leader does not have to ask the experts in the not too distant future ‘&lt;i&gt;How did you get it wrong?’&lt;/i&gt;; ‘&lt;i&gt;How did you miss the signals&lt;/i&gt;?’ if agricultural sector performance does not improve or perhaps drops and millions of smallholder farmers are further impoverished and their families malnourished and displaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this newsletter, we provide four new feature articles on: (i) ethics of innovation in agriculture by Kristal Jones; (ii) innovation and inclusive development by Lynn Mytelka; (iii) research on higher education and science and innovation policy by Marle Jacobs; and (iv) governance of science, technology and innovation for food security in Africa by John Ouma-Mugabe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also highlight some of the documents generated through the 2014 CTA and S&amp;T activities linked to food and nutrition security. These include: (i) the Africa-EU STI FNS road map from the CTA international forum; (ii) the Seed systems, science and policy book which includes a policy brief; (iii) the online ‘Auditing instrument for food security in higher education (AIFHSE)’ tool and (iv) the publication of the 40 papers by African women and young professionals in science linked to the theme “Feeding 1 billion in a changing world”. These are an essential part of our strategy of empowerment and engagement of scientists in STI policy making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please also find below an interesting selection of recent developments and publications which you can find on our website.

      <title>Taking Root: Global trends in agricultural biotechnology</title>
      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/Taking-Root-Global-trends-in-agricultural-biotechnology</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Transgenic crops have recorded the fastest adoption rate of any crop technology in the last century. However, restrictive regulations undermine society’s ability to reap their benefits. In this paper, Calestous Juma and Katherine Gordon of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School of Government, USA, argue that although many transgenic crops are still in the early stage of adoption emerging trends show significant societal benefits through positive economic impacts, fostering food security and promoting environment sustainability. They conclude that transgenic technology leads to more efficient production methods as well as a reduction in loss, which in turn leads to lower food prices. To realize these potential benefits, it is important to view transgenic crops as one of the many sources of food security and to assess their benefits and risks on a case-by-case basis.

      <title>The bumpy path towards knowledge convergence for pro-poor agro-biotechnology regulation and development: exploring Kenya’s regulatory process</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Knowledge production dynamics are explored through an empirical account that documents the biotechnology regulatory trajectory in Kenya over almost two decades. The author, Ann Njoki Kingiri, of the African Centre for Technology Studies (ACTS), Nairobi, Kenya, bases her analysis on papers describing the political nature under which biotechnology development and biosafety regulation have co-evolved. She concludes that scientific knowledge predominantly directs biotechnology development and regulation. Although this process has lacked legal direction, she suggests that lessons learnt from Kenya’s regulatory process should move the country’s biotechnology sector to a higher level in putting the research products in the pipeline to use.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In December 2014, the Council of the European Union endorsed the&lt;a href="http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/action-plan-nutrition-commission-staff-working-document_en" target="_blank"&gt; EU Action Plan on Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. This action plan outlines how the Commission plans to reach its commitment to reducing stunting in children under five by at least 10% (7 million children) of the World Health Assembly goal by 2025. The plan addresses how EU’s strategic objectives in the areas of governance, scaled up interventions and research are to be attained, underscoring the need to work more closely with development actors and partner countries.

      <title>Agricultural development and sustainability: A review of recent and earlier perspectives</title>
      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Selected-publications/Agricultural-development-and-sustainability-A-review-of-recent-and-earlier-perspectives</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, Clem Tisdell, University of Queensland, Australia, reviews various perspectives on agricultural sustainability, starting from three-pillar concept of sustainable development, proposed and applied by Gordon Conway to the evaluation of alternative agro-ecosystems in the 1980s. Tisdell shows that more recent perspectives have adopted a wider approach focusing on ways to sustainably increase agricultural supplies rather than to just maintain them. This recognizes that a substantial increase in demand for agricultural produce is expected in this century. In these approaches comparative roles of agro-ecology and economics in guiding agricultural production are discussed, and the concept of multifunctional agriculture is re-examined in the light of proposals for the sustainable intensification of agriculture.

      <title>Towards achieving food and nutrition security, and changing course in global agriculture</title>
      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Selected-publications/Towards-achieving-food-and-nutrition-security-and-changing-course-in-global-agriculture</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This discussion paper from &lt;a href="http://www.biovision.ch/en/home/" target="_blank"&gt;Biovision&lt;/a&gt; – Foundation for Ecological Development outlines the priorities of a number of organizations for the final stage of the negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda. The paper underlines key concerns including: protecting the balance and the ambitious character of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets, and therefore do not renegotiate the 17 goals and 169 targets; ensuring an equitable multilateral trade system that promotes rural development, food security and animal welfare; creating and expanding the regulatory environment for long-term investments in food security and sustainable food systems; promoting additional financing for microfinance, small and medium enterprises within sustainable food systems and research, as well as capacity building in financial literacy; and recognizing the role that the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) can play in reviewing and monitoring the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda. The paper also calls for ensuring that a number of issues that have not been taken up in the UN Secretary-General's synthesis report will be reflected in the post-2015 development agenda such as doubling the incomes of small-scale food producers; maintaining the genetic diversity of farm animals, as well as seeds and cultivated plants; limiting extreme food price volatility; halving food waste and reducing food losses; and striving to achieve a land-degradation neutral world.

      <title>A framework for assessing effects of the food system </title>
      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Selected-publications/A-framework-for-assessing-effects-of-the-food-system</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The framework for assessing effects of the food system has developed an analytical tool for assessing effects associated with the ways in which food is grown, processed, distributed, marketed, retailed and consumed. The framework allows users to recognize effects across the full food system, consider all domains and dimensions of effects, account for systems dynamics and complexities, and choose appropriate methods for analysis. This report provides examples of applications of the framework based on complex questions that are currently under debate: consumption of a healthy and safe diet, food security, animal welfare and preserving the environment and its resources. Although the framework has been designed and tested for the US, the methodology could be applied in developing countries and become an essential resource for decision makers, researchers and others to examine the possible impacts of alternative policies or agricultural or food processing practices.

      <title>Robust cropping systems to tackle pests under climate change. A review</title>
      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Selected-publications/Robust-cropping-systems-to-tackle-pests-under-climate-change.-A-review</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article reviews the effects of climate change on crop protection and strategies to reduce the impact of future invasive crop pests as well as those of rapidly evolving resident populations. The authors make the following points: (i) the consequence of climate change and globalization is a heightened level of unpredictability of interactions between weather, cropping systems and pests; (ii) the unpredictable adaptation of pests to a changing environment creates uncertainty and projected changes do not automatically translate into doom and gloom scenarios; (iii) faced with uncertainty, policy, research, and extension should prepare for worst-case scenarios following a ‘no regrets’ approach that promotes resilience vis-à-vis pests; (iv) farmers can take advantage of Web 2.0 and other new technologies to make the exchange of updated information quicker and easier; and (v) cooperation between historically compartmentalized experts in plant health and crop protection could help develop anticipation strategies.

      <title>Climate variation explains a third of global crop yield variability</title>
      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/Climate-variation-explains-a-third-of-global-crop-yield-variability</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent climate variability has led to variations in maize, rice, wheat and soybean crop yields worldwide. While some areas show no significant influence of climate variability, in substantial areas of the global breadbaskets, over 60% of the yield variability can be explained by climate variability. This is the conclusion of a study by Deepak Ray and colleagues at the Institute on the Environment (IonE), University of Minnesota, USA. They used detailed crop statistics time series to examine how recent climate variability has led to variations in maize, rice, wheat and soybean crop yields worldwide. Their study uniquely illustrates spatial patterns in the relationship between climate variability and crop yield variability, highlighting where variations in temperature, precipitation or their interaction explain yield variability. They also discuss key drivers for the observed variations to target further research and policy interventions geared towards buffering future crop production from climate variability.

      <title>Coping with climate change: The role of genetic resources for food and agriculture</title>
      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Selected-publications/Coping-with-climate-change-The-role-of-genetic-resources-for-food-and-agriculture</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Genetic resources have a critical role to play in feeding the world, especially as climate change advances faster than expected, and much more needs to be done to study, preserve and utilize the biological diversity that underpins world food production. In this new book published by the FAO the authors argue that that the ability of plants and animals raised by farmers to withstand volatile conditions and adapt when the environment changes is a direct result of their genetic diversity. However, stronger efforts are needed to study and use this diversity as a coping mechanism, and to develop policies to support it. In particular, improving knowledge, conservation and use of crop wild relatives is important. They are likely to have genetic traits that can be used to develop well-adapted crops for use in climate change-affected food systems.

      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/Review-of-effects-of-climate-change-on-agriculture</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Agriculture in the twenty-first century faces the challenge of meeting food demands while satisfying sustainability goals, according to a team of experts from &lt;a href="http://www.endure-network.eu/about_endure" target="_blank"&gt;ENDURE&lt;/a&gt; , a network of Europe's leading agricultural research, teaching and extension institutes with a special interest in Integrated Pest Management (IPM). In this review, the authors note that climate change is likely to increase the complexity of this challenge by affecting the distribution of some crop pests (harmful insects, plants and pathogenic agents) and the severity of their outbreaks. They explain why climate change is becoming increasingly central within the European policy agenda, mainly with respect to food security in the European Union, and expect that the issue will be recognized in the future EU research agenda. The team proposes that diversification of current plant protection strategies is needed to mitigate the effects of climate change on European agriculture.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The shift in land-use patterns in agricultural landscapes might influence crop diseases to provide predictive tools to evaluate management practices. This is the conclusion of a study by researchers at NRA, France, with colleagues from around the world who found that landscape structures that promoted larger pathogen populations on wild hosts facilitated the emergence of a crop pathogen; but such landscape structures also reduced the potential for the pathogen population to adapt to the crop. In addition, they determined the evolutionary trajectory of the pathogen population by interactions between the factors describing the landscape structure and those describing the pathogen life-histories. &amp;nbsp;(&lt;i&gt;Evolutionary Applications&lt;/i&gt;, 03/02/2015)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download the &lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.12251/pdf" target="_blank"&gt;text of the article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Beyond N and P: Toward a land resource ecology perspective and impactful fertilizer interventions in Sub-Saharan Africa</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Initial results of experiments with multiple plant nutrients present in soils show that the proportion expressed as ratios impacts crop yields rather than absolute levels, indicating the existence of complex nutrient relations. These ratios are particularly important among Ca, Mg and K, between P and micronutrients and among the micronutrients themselves. Such ratios are shown to govern the ecological diversity of vegetation and spatial pattern of soils. It is therefore essential to include all essential nutrients in agronomic and fertilizer research. Limited amounts of optimal ratios of (micro)nutrients tuned to local soil chemical properties can have large impacts on yield and result in higher fertilizer uptake efficiency.

      <title>DivSeek mines the genetic treasure in seed bank vaults</title>
      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/DivSeek-mines-the-genetic-treasure-in-seed-bank-vaults</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new initiative, DivSeek, was unveiled in January 2015. This programme systematically characterizes the genetic, physical, and biochemical makeup of banked seeds in the hope of exploiting traits such as drought tolerance and pest resistance that could help the development of better crop varieties. The 69-member DivSeek consortium, which includes the world’s leading agricultural research centres, expects that DivSeek will help agricultural gene banks to make the transition from warehouses for plant seeds to become seed centres that can start to capitalize on the often hidden value of some 7 million seed deposits held in more than 1700 repositories around the world. &amp;nbsp;(&lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;, 09/01/2015)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Improving markets for seeds and fertilizers in West Africa</title>
      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/Improving-markets-for-seeds-and-fertilizers-in-West-Africa2</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;West African governments, through ECOWAS and other regional bodies, have been working to develop harmonized trade rules and quality control procedures for improving farmers’ access to quality seeds and fertilizers. Regional regulations based on advanced international standards have mostly been agreed upon and are helping to guide quality improvements in some countries. Nevertheless, most countries do not currently have the physical capacity or institutional structures needed to implement the agreed trade rules, which will take considerable time and investment to develop. This World Bank analysis points to the need for pragmatic solutions that are easy for individual countries or groups of countries to implement in the near term while longer-term progress towards full harmonization continues.

      <title>Mapping for investments in biofortification: Launch of a new interactive tool</title>
      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/Mapping-for-investments-in-biofortification-Launch-of-a-new-interactive-tool</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;HarvestPlus has launched a new, interactive online tool, Biofortification Priority Index (BPI), with which optimal investment decisions can be made on biofortified crops with the highest pay off in reducing micronutrient deficiencies. BPI focuses on three micronutrients – iron, vitamin A, and zinc – and allows users to search and sort through three easy-to-use drop-down menus, with results displayed on a colour-coded map according to crop, region and priority for investment. It comes at a time when biofortification is attracting increased recognition as a viable strategy to improve the nutritional status of populations dependent on staple food crops for sustenance. More detailed explanations of the data and methodology behind the BPI are available in the full &lt;a href="http://www.harvestplus.org/sites/default/files/working%20paper%20_11_web_0.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;HarvestPlus Working Paper&lt;/a&gt; on which the tool is based.

      <title>Use of micronutrients in tropical and sub-tropical fruit crops: a review</title>
      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/Use-of-micronutrients-in-tropical-and-sub-tropical-fruit-crops-a-review</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the inception of commercial farming the emphasis has been on increasing production without proper&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;management of the soil nutrient balance. As a result micronutrients, which are important for keeping soil in a healthy condition have been neglected, resulting in progressively falling production. This is the conclusion of a recent study by M.K. Yadav, Ministry of Horticulture and Food Processing, Satna, India, and V.K. Solanki, Navsari Agricultural University, India. They argue that without minimizing the importance of macronutrients in quadrupling fruit production worldwide over the last 50 years, micronutrients will play a major productive and qualitative role in bringing stability and sustainability to farm production systems in the future.

      <title>Participatory development of common certification codes and practices for small coffee growing farms</title>
      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/Participatory-development-of-common-certification-codes-and-practices-for-small-coffee-growing-farms</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sustainable coffee is going through a rapid transformation from production for niche markets to a fully recognized agribusiness production system that serves both mainstream and specialty coffee markets. Current trends suggest that certified coffee is not only here to stay, but that conformity with one standard or another will soon become a requirement for market entry. In fact, many coffee growers in Nicaragua are already using one or more certification programmes to gain access to various coffee markets. The article concludes that certified coffee farmers will have to make significant on-farm investments and management changes to meet multiple certification requirements, while at the same time meeting the administrative and monitoring requirements associated with multiple certification programmes.

      <title>The technological edge for animal feed producers</title>
      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/The-technological-edge-for-animal-feed-producers2</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;New portable devices are helping the animal feed industry to blur the lines between the lab and the field. By eliminating the need to ship samples to centralized labs, handheld analysers provide fast, actionable results at the point of need. The ability to test at multiple stages in the supply chain is important for traceability as well as quality. For feed manufacturers, the demand for greater efficiency, transparency and performance will only increase. To stay ahead of the competition – and reduce the costs of quality control procedures – the industry will continue to adapt, and technologies such as portable NIR (near-infrared) spectroscopy technology will play an increasingly important role. Moving precision and efficiency from the lab to the wider supply chain is one way that smart feed producers can achieve new levels of growth. (AllAboutFeed.com, 19/12/2014)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to catch the overfishermen</title>
      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/How-to-catch-the-overfishermen</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Big data could help protect stocks of tuna and swordfish that have fallen by 90% since the 1950s. Until now, efforts to stop illegal fishing have been more or less futile. The oceans are vast, and navies and coastguard patrols are small. However, it is now feasible to synthesize information from sources such as radio transponders and satellite observations, in order to track every ocean-going vessel that is, or might be, a fishing boat. Such data can show when a vessel is behaving suspiciously in a prohibited area. They can also link particular vessels with the receiving ships to which they transfer their catches for transport to market. However, this promising use of big data system will work only if governments enforce existing rules. (&lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt;, 23/01/2015)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Diversifying the use of tuna to improve food security and public health in Pacific island countries and territories</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The large tuna resources of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean are delivering great economic benefits to Pacific Island countries and territories through sale of licences to distant fishing nations and employment in fish processing. However, tuna needs to contribute to Pacific Island societies in another important way – by increasing local access to the fish required for good nutrition to help combat the world’s highest levels of diabetes and obesity. In this study, Johann D. Bell of SPC’s Fisheries, Aquaculture and Marine Ecosystems Division, New Caledonia, and colleagues argue that tuna should also be used to enhance nutrition and diets. They demonstrate that in 2020 and 2035 just 2.1% and 5.9% of the average present-day industrial tuna catch will be required to fill the gap in domestic fish supply. They describe various policies and programmes that promise to increase access to fish for sustaining the health of the Pacific’s growing populations.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the Caribbean region, obesity as a result of growing consumption of imported processed foods is becoming a growing health problem. In response, the Farm to Fork project – a multi-sector, integrated approach to food and nutrition security– together with smallholder farmers in St Kitts-Nevis and Trinidad and Tobago, and in Guyana and St Lucia – has developed year-round production systems of fruit and vegetables in order to supply the national school feeding programmes, as a step towards improving children’s nutrition and dietary diversity.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) has now made available the presentations made at the closed workshop on ‘Nutrition and Health Outcomes: Targets for Agricultural Research’, held in September 2014. The workshop was held to inform the second round of CGIAR Research Program proposals to ensure that agricultural research would deliver improved nutrition outcomes. The participants organized their discussions around two themes: (i) research to increase access to affordable, nutritious and safe diets, and (ii) evaluating the impact of agricultural interventions and investments on nutrition.

      <title>Effects of combined traditional processing methods on the nutritional quality of beans</title>
      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/Effects-of-combined-traditional-processing-methods-on-the-nutritional-quality-of-beans2</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers of Makerere University, Uganda, have developed a processing method for production of fast cooking bean flours and assessed the effect of processing on the nutritional characteristics of the flours. Dry beans were soaked for 12 h; sprouted for 48 h; dehulled and steamed for 25 and 15 min for whole and dehulled beans, respectively, or roasted at 170°C for 45 and 15 min for whole and dehulled beans respectively. Dehulling eliminated phytates and tannins and increased protein digestibility. In vitro protein digestibility and mineral extractability were negatively correlated with tannin and phytate content. Total available carbohydrates were highest in moist heat-treated bean flours. Overall, combined processing of beans improved the nutritional quality of dry beans and the resulting precooked flours need shorter cooking times compared with whole dry beans.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In November 2014, the FAO organized a training course, ‘Stockbreeding, Means of Subsistence and Nutrition’, in Dakar, Senegal, to train the technical staff of development agencies to better integrate nutrition into breeding and rearing programmes. The workshop addressed one of the current concerns in the Sahel and West Africa, which is to increase the impacts of nutrition in development projects and contribute more to reducing malnutrition and improving resilience. FAO has now published a report on this workshop, which includes training setup and materials. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(GRET, 01/02/2015) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/food-security-capacity-building/docs/Rapport%20atelier_Elevage%20Moyen%20dexistence%20et%20Nutrition%20humaine%20_Dakar%20Nov%202014.pdf" target="_self"&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt; the FAO report.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Begomovirus disease complex: emerging threat to vegetable production systems of Africa  </title>
      <link>http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/Begomovirus-disease-complex-emerging-threat-to-vegetable-production-systems-of-Africa</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Begomoviruses are transmitted by the whitefly vector &lt;i&gt;Bemisia tabaci&lt;/i&gt; and cause extreme reductions in the yields of a number of economically important vegetables such as tomato, pepper and okra in West and Central Africa. In this paper, Walter N. Leke, IIATA, Nigeria, and colleagues describe how they sequenced the viral genomes from various crops and identified two previously known begomovirus species (cotton leaf curl Gezira virus and okra yellow crinkle virus), a new recombinant begomovirus species (okra leaf curl&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Cameroon&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;virus), a betasatellite (cotton leaf curl Gezira betasatellite) and new alphasatellites. Tomato and pepper plants with leaf curling were shown to contain isolates of new begomoviruses, collectively referred to as West African tomato-infecting begomoviruses (WATIBs), new alphasatellites and betasatellites. They found a close relationship between the begomoviruses that infect pepper and tomato and&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;the weed &lt;i&gt;Ageratum&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; conyzoides,&lt;/i&gt; and the detection of the same alphasatellite in them supports the idea that weeds are important reservoirs for begomoviruses and their satellites. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;i&gt;Agriculture &amp; Food Security&lt;/i&gt;, 21/01/2015)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>World crop diversity survives in small farms from peri-urban to remote rural locations  </title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As much as 75% of global seed diversity in staple food crops is held and actively used by a wide range of smallholder farmers, with the rest in gene banks. This is the conclusion of a study by Karl Zimmerer, Steven Vanek and colleagues from the GeoSyntheSES (&lt;a href="http://www.geog.psu.edu/geosyntheSES" target="_self"&gt;Geographic Synthesis for Social-Ecological Sustainability &lt;/a&gt;) Lab at Penn State University, USA. They looked at new census data from 11 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America and combined the data with field observations to develop an understanding of who is farming what and exactly where. Knowledge of potential problems faced by these farmers and plans for responses to potential disruptions of agriculture are important to preserve diversity and improve food security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(EurekAlert, 13/02/2015)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
