They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

<p>Here below, a list of recent developments in agricultural research. Feel free to comment or share relevant articles and notes. &nbsp;</p><p>-</p><p><b>Scientific Writing for Agricultural Research Scientists: A Training Resource Manual</b></p><p>The need for training targeted at African agricultural research scientists on the procedures and techniques for writing and publishing the results of their research has been identified by a variety of institutions, organisations and agricultural research and development networks throughout the region. This manual focuses attention on analysing the structure of a scientific research paper, planning the writing process, observing style and ethics in scientific writing, correctly citing bibliographic references, and presenting agricultural research results orally.</p><p><a href="http://knowledge.cta.int/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Selected-publications/Scientific-Writing-for-Agricultural-Research-Scientists-A-Training-Resource-Manual" target="_self">http://knowledge.cta.int/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Selected-publications/Scientific-Writing-for-Agricultural-Research-Scientists-A-Training-Resource-Manual</a></p><p>- &nbsp;</p><p><b>Eco-ribbean - A Climate of Change&nbsp;</b></p><p><a href="http://knowledge.cta.int/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/Eco-ribbean-A-Climate-of-Change" target="_self">http://knowledge.cta.int/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/Eco-ribbean-A-Climate-of-Change</a></p><p>An exciting interactive resource on climate change for Caribbean students: It contains captivating games, puzzles and simulations, and stunning videos and photos that facilitate our understanding and deepen our knowledge of climate change, particularly as it impacts the region. A multi-sensory DVD-ROM was developed by NIHERST, the UNDP in Trinidad and Tobago and the Caribbean Council for Science and Technology (CCST). Secondary schools throughout the regions will receive copies of Eco-ribbean.</p><p>Of note too, NIHERST embarked on a project to develop more sustainable communities, working with the Global Water Partnership-Caribbean and the Toco Foundation, in October 2011. The initial focus is rainwater harvesting systems (RWHS) in water-scarce communities combined with solar energy solutions. Since the first installation of the RWHS at the Rochard Douglas Presbyterian Primary School in July 2012, harvesters were installed at schools in Toco and Moruga. The rainwater harvesters have proved to be very beneficial to the schools which have experienced water shortages, particularly in the dry season. The additional water supply has helped to decrease the amount of down-time created by the closure of school due to the lack of water.</p><p>(NIHERST, 2013)</p><p>-</p><p><b>The influence and implications of climate change on coffee berry borer and coffee production in East Africa</b></p><p>Scientists from <i><a href="http://www.icipe.org/index.php/news/739-icipe-led-study-selected-by-plos-among-most-influential-on-qthe-ecological-impacts-of-climate-changeq.html" target="_self">icipe</a></i> used the CLIMEX model to <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0024528" target="_self">relate present-day insect distributions to current climate</a> and to project the fitted climatic envelopes under two future climate scenarios [A2A (Intensive economic growth but regional and very heterogeneous development) and B2B (Diverse and local solutions to development, less intensive with lower population growth)]. In both scenarios, the situation with the coffee berry borer (<i>Hypothenemus hampei</i>) is forecasted to worsen in the current <i>Coffea arabica</i> producing areas of Ethiopia, the Ugandan part of the Lake Victoria and Mt Elgon regions, Mt Kenya and the Kenyan side of Mt Elgon, and most of Rwanda and Burundi.</p><p>&nbsp;(<i>icipe</i> 05/08/2013 and <i>PLoS ONE</i> 6(9): e24528, 14/09/2011)</p><p>-</p><p><b>Redefining agricultural yields: from tonnes to people nourished per hectare </b></p><p><a href="http://agro.biodiver.se/2013/08/a-diverse-look-at-productivity/" target="_self">This</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/3/034015/" target="_self">study</a> by Emily S. Cassidy and colleagues of the Institute on the Environment (IonE), University of Minnesota finds that, given the current mix of crop uses, growing food exclusively for direct human consumption could, in principle, increase available food calories by as much as 70%, which could feed an additional 4 billion people. Even small shifts in our allocation of crops to animal feed and biofuels could significantly increase global food availability. Currently, 36% of the calories produced by the world's crops are being used for animal feed, and only 12% of those feed calories ultimately contribute to the human diet (as meat and other animal products).</p><p>(<i>Environ. Res. Lett.</i> 8 034015 via Agrobiodiver.se, 08/08/2013)</p><p>-</p><p><b>Enhancing the timeliness and relevance of food and nutrition security information</b></p><p>Food and Nutrition Security Information (FNSI) is a critical tool for achieving food and nutrition security, yet FNSI efforts to date have not produced the intended impacts on policy and programme decision making, largely due to shortcomings in available technologies and frameworks. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211912412000351?np=y" target="_self">This article</a> by Nancy Mock and colleagues from Tulane University reviews the evolution of FNSI efforts in the context of emerging technology and data collection techniques. A conceptual framework is provided to describe the evolution towards an FNSI characterised by integrating conventional and novel approaches to the collection, analysis and communication of information into a value stream that supports decision making to achieve food security.</p><p>(<i>Global Food Security</i>, Vol. 2 Iss. 1, 01/03/2013)</p><p>-</p><p><b>A UK strategy for agricultural technologies</b></p><p>The UK Government <a href="http://planetearth.nerc.ac.uk/blogs/post.aspx?id=1037&amp;pid=413&amp;cookieConsent=A" target="_self">recently released</a> its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/224610/13-1060_A_UK_strategy_for_agricultural_technologies.pdf" target="_self">UK Strategy for Agricultural Technologies</a>, which sets out how it plans to put Britain at the forefront of these technologies. It involves building on the nation's strengths and investing £160m in new technologies, £70m through a new agri-tech Catalyst Centre and £90m through government funding for Centres for Agricultural Innovation to explore and innovate in domains such as precision farming and no-till cultivation, GM crops, new anti-pest strategies and even the use of drones and nanotechnology.&nbsp;</p><p>(NERC, 30/07/2013)</p><p>-</p><p><b>Biosafety legislation and biotechnology development gains momentum in Africa</b></p><p><a href="http://www.fly-bay.org/journals/gmcrops/2011GMC0025R.pdf" target="_self">This article</a> (PDF) examines the status of biosafety regulation across Africa, pertinent challenges and the extent to which regulation fosters or constrains the development of agricultural biotechnology.</p><p>(<i>GM Crops and Food: Biotechnology in Agriculture and the Food Chain</i> 3:1, 72–77, 2012)</p><p>-</p><p><b>Special report: OECD's Innovation, Higher Education and Research for Development project</b></p><p><a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/specialreports/index.php?action=view&amp;report=35" target="_self">http://www.universityworldnews.com/specialreports/index.php?action=view&amp;report=35</a></p><p>Around 50 academics, policy experts and managers <a href="http://www.oecd.org/sti/iherd-marseille-expert-meeting.htm" target="_self">got together</a> with development assistance agencies in Marseille on 1-2 July 2013 for a meeting of the OECD’s Innovation, Higher Education and Research for Development – IHERD – programme, financed by the Swedish donor agency SIDA. The meeting had the theme 'Increasing Evidence-based Approaches in the Design and Implementation of Innovation and Research Policy in Developing Countries'. Themes ranged from building bridges between these three pillars, the importance of networking, the role of research universities, South-South collaboration, competitive funding, research capacity and strategies in developing countries, and the mandate of Centres of Excellence.&nbsp; IHERD brought together two different research communities – higher education studies, and research (or science) policy. Synergies between the two sectors have been recommended both in terms of transnational funding mechanisms and coordination of capacity and research communities.</p><p>(University World News, 19/08/2013)</p><p>-</p><p><b>Jamaica is encouraging local food production for economic reasons</b></p><p>Across the Caribbean, food imports have become a budget-busting problem for governments, prompting one of the world’s most fertile regions to reclaim its agricultural past. But instead of turning to big agribusinesses, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/world/americas/as-cost-of-importing-food-soars-jamaica-turns-to-the-earth.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_self">officials are recruiting everyone</a> they can to combat the cost of imports, which have roughly doubled in price over the past decade. In Jamaica, Haiti, the Bahamas and elsewhere, local farm-to-table production is not a restaurant sales pitch; it is a government motto. Jamaica started earlier than most. A decade ago, the government unveiled a national food security campaign with the slogan ‘grow what we eat, eat what we grow’. Grocery stores now identify local produce with large stickers and prominent displays.</p><p>&nbsp;(<i>The New York Times</i>, 04/08/2013)</p><p>-</p><p><b>A reference manual for utilising and managing the soil resources of Fiji</b></p><p><a href="http://knowledge.cta.int/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Selected-publications/A-Reference-Manual-for-Utilising-and-Managing-the-Soil-Resources-of-Fiji" target="_self">This publication</a> provides a broad framework for understanding and interpreting the soil resources of Fiji in bringing together into one document all the relevant available soil data. It describes these data in a user-friendly format. A useful component of the manual is the matching of land qualities with crop requirements, leading to a determination of suitability classes for 78 crops. In separate formats, single-factor maps for each crop have been generated, and enterprise gross margins have been prepared in Excel spreadsheets.</p><p>(SPC/CPS, 2012)</p><p>-</p><p><b>Soil nutrient management in Haiti: lessons for future agricultural interventions</b></p><p>Remy Bargout and Manish Raizada at the Department of Plant Agriculture, University of Guelph, Canada review <a href="http://www.agricultureandfoodsecurity.com/content/2/1/11" target="_self">the intrinsic factors that contribute to soil infertility</a> in modern Haiti, along with indigenous pre-Columbian soil interventions and modern soil interventions, including farmer-derived interventions and interventions by the Haitian government and Haitian non-governmental organisations (NGOs), bilateral and multilateral agencies, foreign NGOs, and the foreign private sector. This review shows how agricultural soil degradation in modern Haiti is exacerbated by topology, soil type, and rainfall distribution, along with non-sustainable farming practices and poverty. Recommendations aim to address the most important soil intervention gaps in Haiti that include inadequate farmer training (extension) in soil management, and lack of technical support for legume and cover crops and for livestock pastures.</p><p>(<i>Agriculture &amp; Food Security</i> 2013, 2:11)</p><p>-</p><p><b>Research needs in root system architecture</b></p><p>Xin Tian, molecular plant scientist at the University of Edinburgh and Peter Doerner, plant cellular physiologist at INRA, France<a href="http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Systems_Biology/10.3389/fpls.2013.00303/full" target="_self">, review the literature on resource foraging</a>, the process by which root system architecture changes over time to acquire resources. The study brings to light the high diversity of root behaviour, including foraging, observed in different species, even in different accessions of the same species, revealing its adaptive nature. The scientists see the need for more fundamental research into root growth mechanisms to inform transgenic approaches and breeding programmes based on existing germplasm. Research into root foraging should not be restricted to crop plants and their interactions, they conclude, saying there is much to learn from wild plants how inter-species competition and different niches have shaped root foraging strategies in evolution in the quest for more resilient performance for crops experiencing environmental stresses.</p><p>(<i>Front. Plant Sci.</i>, 12/08/2013)</p><p>-</p><p><b>Innovation in measurement leads to effective prevention of post-harvest loss </b></p><p>Steve Sonka, the Director of the ADM Institute for the Prevention of Postharvest Loss, a research centre at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, writes in a post titled <a href="http://publish.illinois.edu/phlinstitute/2013/08/28/innovation-in-measurement-perspective-and-practice/" target="_self">'Innovation in Measurement: Perspective and Practice</a>' in which avenues are discussed to counter the lack of widespread data needed to measure post-harvest losses. Sonka explains that, for decision makers evaluating national food policy, smallholder farmers, or managers throughout the food chain, measurement benefit/cost ratio hasn’t justified widespread collection of relevant data.&nbsp; According to Sonka, innovation in measurement, which could lead to more effective prevention of post-harvest loss, requires capitalising on new technologies, especially information communications technology (ICT) such as mobile phones and social media platforms. He suggests an aggressive effort to adapt technologies not created for application in agriculture, to adopt sophisticated analytical techniques, and to aligning incentives in the design of measurement schemes.</p><p>(ADM PHL Institute, 28/08/2013)</p><p>-</p><p><b>Advances in remote sensing of agriculture: context, existing monitoring systems and major Information needs</b></p><p><a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/5/2/949" target="_self">This extensive review</a> by Clement Atzberger, at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Austria, describes and illustrates five different remote sensing applications used in agriculture to assess their pertinence in the most current challenges facing the sector: environmental impact evaluation, changing climate adaptation, increasing production and productivity. The applications are (1) biomass and yield estimation, (2) vegetation vigor and drought stress monitoring, (3) assessment of crop phenological development, (4) crop acreage estimation and cropland mapping and (5) mapping of disturbances and land use/land cover (LULC) changes. In the end, Atzberger's recommendations on future developments include: ensure timeliness of information, access and validation of ground truth information, more precise atmospheric correction algorithms, Sensor inter-calibration studies, more detailed description of a product's purpose and limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/5/2/949" target="_self">http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/5/2/949</a></p><p>(<i>Remote Sensing</i>, 5, 949-981, 2013)</p><p>-</p><p><b>Newly completed genome sequences of food-borne disease-causing micro-organisms</b></p><p>The 100K Genome Project, led by the University of California, Davis, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, has added <a href="http://news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id=10660" target="_self">20 newly completed genome sequences</a> of food-borne disease-causing micro-organisms to its public database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The newly deposited sequences include several isolates of <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Listeria</i>, <i>Campylobacter</i>, and <i>Vibrio</i>, as well as a full characterisation of their epigenomes: the genomes were determined using Single Molecule, Real-Time Sequencing, a proprietary technology.</p><p>(UC Davis, 22/07/2013)</p><p>-</p><p><b>Can value chains and innovation platforms boost African agriculture? 11 reasons to be sceptical</b></p><p>Toni Darbas (CSIRO, Australia) and Jim Sumberg (IDS, UK) <a href="http://www.future-agricultures.org/blog/entry/can-value-chains-and-innovation-platforms-boost-african-agriculture-11-reasons-to-be-sceptical" target="_self">express their scepticism</a> about the recent ‘value chains’ narrative in agricultural development discourse that sees agriculture as a ‘business’ that must be ‘professionalised’. The authors believe that there are good reasons to be sceptical about their ability to deliver on the high expectations that are being laid at their door. Some of the reasons for scepticism they list are: unknown feedback across administrative scales; unknown evolution of transaction costs; private sector interests vs. public ones; inclusion issues; innovation blueprints insensitive to context; little direct evidence of positive impact of innovation platforms and value chains to poor farmers.&nbsp; They believe there is the constant danger of slipping into uncritical, formulaic and context insensitive responses. A much more critical and realistic approach to the potential contribution and applicability of both value chain approaches and innovation platforms would likely pay large dividends, they conclude.</p><p>(Future Agricultures, 07/08/2013)</p><p>-</p><p><b>Soil biodiversity crucial to future land management response to climate change</b></p><p>Research by scientists at The University of Manchester and Lancaster shows maintaining healthy soil biodiversity can play an important role in optimising land management programmes in the face of climate change. <a href="http://phys.org/news/2013-08-soil-biodiversity-crucial-future-response.html" target="_self">The study shows</a> that there is a strong link between soil organisms and the overall functioning of ecosystems. This is the first time researchers have looked at the entire community of organisms in the soil and the associated dynamics in liberating nitrogen for plant growth and locking up carbon. The findings will help in predicting how land use and climate change will impact on ecosystems and looking at ways to minimise negative changes.</p><p>(Phys.org, 12/08/2013)</p><p>-</p><p><b>The assumption that a cow needs a higher energy intake before calving challenged</b></p><p>Animal sciences researcher Phil Cardoso and colleagues at the University of Illinois College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences (ACES), <a href="http://www.alphagalileo.org/ViewItem.aspx?ItemId=133665&amp;CultureCode=en" target="_self">conducted an experiment</a> to compare cows fed before calving with diets containing the recommended energy levels (of the US regime) to cows fed only 80% of the recommended energy amount.
