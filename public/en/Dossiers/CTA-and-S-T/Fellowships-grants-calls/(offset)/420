						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>The Women's Leadership Scholarship (WLS) program in Washington, DC, creates educational opportunities for women who are grassroots leaders, organizers and activists from the Global South and/or from indigenous groups. WLS invests in women's leadership by supporting non-doctoral graduate education in human rights, sustainable development, and public health. 
Due to losses caused by the current global financial crisis, and uncertainty about the timing of recovery, the Channel Foundation regrets that it must suspend its Women’s Leadership Scholarship Program for new applicants for 2009-10. Current recipients in two year programs will receive renewal funding for the second year of their programs. We look forward to positive indicators that will enable us to reopen the program for 2010-11.(Update February 2009)</p>

					<p> The Borlaug Fellows Program funds faculty and scientist exchange programs – short-term scientific training for international agricultural research scientists and policymakers from selected developing countries. Each Fellow is assigned a mentor who will coordinate the Fellow’s training. Training venues include U.S. land grant universities, USDA or other government agencies, private companies, not-for-profit institutions and international agricultural research centers. The Program provides promising young scientists with an opportunity to work closely with U.S. and international specialists in their fields of agricultural science. Selected Fellows will work closely with their assigned mentor, learn new research techniques, access fully equipped libraries, and learn about public-private research partnerships. Fellows will also have an opportunity to learn about graduate curricula in agricultural research. It is expected that the Fellows will apply the knowledge obtained through the program in their own research and teaching activities, and share it with colleagues at their home institutions and throughout their country. Fellows can be trained at U.S. universities (especially land grant universities), international agricultural research centers, international organizations, and private sector research and policy centers. Participants in the Borlaug Fellows Program must agree to return to their home institution for at least two years following their training experience so the goal of establishing ongoing international collaboration can be achieved.</p>

					<p> The University of the West Indies (UWI) Centre for Resource Management and Environmental Studies (CERMES) at the Cave Hill Campus in Barbados is offering two MPhil degree fellowships for full time interdisciplinary research on marine resource governance in the eastern Caribbean available for 2007/08 and 2008/09 academic years. Each fellowship provides BBD$35,000 (US$17,500) per year for two years. The fellowships are associated with the CERMES research project on ‘Marine Resource Governance in the Eastern Caribbean’ (MarGov project). Before contacting us, persons interested in this opportunity should first visit our <a href="http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/cermes/margov_profile.html" target="_blank">website</a> for information on the project. The focus is on examining coastal and marine resource governance at national and local levels in OECS countries and Barbados primarily using concepts from complex adaptive systems and network analysis.  Persons should also determine if they satisfy the UWI requirements for admission to an MPhil degree. Refer to the UWI School or Graduate Studies and Research ‘Manual of procedures for graduate diplomas &amp; degrees’ available at <a href="http://www.uwi.edu/documents/pdfs/Manual_Of_Procedures_2005.pdf" target="_blank">www.uwi.edu/documents/pdfs/Manual_Of_Procedures_2005.pdf</a> or consult the School directly. The minimum admission requirement for an MPhil programme is an Upper Second Class Honours first degree or its equivalent.  CERMES will consider persons with natural science, social science or interdisciplinary first degrees. Preference will be for degrees that included marine resource studies and for candidates familiar with Caribbean countries. Candidates in an MPhil programme are required to register for some graduate courses, but this degree is awarded primarily on the basis of a research thesis. Strong research and fieldwork skills are essential. The UWI Graduate Studies process for application to do an MPhil will apply. Persons who are both interested and eligible may contact the project with an expression of interest, a recent CV and a copy of their academic transcript.

					<p><a href="http://www.start.org/index.html" target="_blank">START website</a> is widely recognized as the focal point for global change science capacity building. In recent evaluations, START has been assessed as 'filling an important and unique role' and being 'highly successful in developing regional research networks and research driven capacity building' . The underlying philosophy for most START initiatives has been research-driven capacity building. Priority is given to capacity building activities closely linked to research and research themes and activities of the international global change science programmes enhancing research capabilities to contribute to those programmes. START's capacity building activities have included a range of activities, including fellowships, small grants, collaborative research networks and projects and research linked training - all primarily focused on developing and enhancing research capacity.START’s African Small Grants are provided to African scientists for one-year projects on global environmental change (GEC) in Africa. Scientists are encouraged to draw upon various GEC Science Plans including the Plan of the African Network for Earth System Science (AfricanNESS) 1, the Plans of the International Council for Science Regional Office for Africa (ICSU RoA) 2, and other relevant documents from intergovernmental and multi-lateral organizations.</p>
