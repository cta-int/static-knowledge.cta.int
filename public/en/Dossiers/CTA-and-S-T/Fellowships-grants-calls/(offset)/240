						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>This call invites proposals for case studies to be included in an edited book that seeks to tell the story of how adaptive collaborative approaches have emerged and played out in different contexts of Agriculture and Natural Resource (ANR) management and governance. Six case studies will be selected from different contexts to highlight opportunities and challenges as to how diverse sources of knowledge – formal research, indigenous knowledge, practical sense, tacit knowledge – can be blended (or what constraints they face) to inform effective system of innovation in ANR sectors. The six case studies will provide in-depth accounts of how traditional practices of research and development have been subjected to external pressures for adaptive collaborative approaches to management, and how ANR actors have responded to the changing contexts of resource governance. Key questions to be addressed by the case studies are: how did adaptive collaborative approaches have emerged and put into use (marking a shift to ‘research into action’ from ‘research and extension’ approach); what were the challenges along the way; what helped, and what held it back; over time, how did this family of approaches mature; and what outstanding challenges remain?

					<p>
Neglected and underutilised plant species (NUS) include hundreds of locally domesticated and wild species, which are rich in nutrients and adapted to low-input agriculture. NUS and their traditional production systems can play a key role in supporting rural livelihoods. They are important in strategies to alleviate the effects of biotic and abiotic stresses – particularly those related to climate change. Their commercialization can provide income opportunities and many NUS species are important in traditional pharmacology. Due to the intensification of agriculture and the commoditization of food markets towards a narrow range of the most important food crops, diversity of NUS and associated local knowledge is rapidly being lost. Research, therefore, on NUS needs strengthening.

JAFSCD is online at <a href="http://www.agdevjournal.com/" target="_self">www.AgDevJournal.com</a>. 
JAFSCD welcomes research or policy briefs and case studies (up to 2,500 words) and full articles (up to 8,500 words) on best community-development practices related to the call for articles below. Authors are invited to submit articles under one of two categories: Best Practices in Urban and Peri-Urban and Agriculture Development. <b>Deadline: June 30, 2010</b> (The deadline may be extended with permission of the publisher.) 
The Journal welcomes papers at any time on any subject related to the development aspects of agriculture and food systems. Content can focus specifically on conservation and farmland protection, value-adding, coopera&amp;shy;tive marketing, value chains, distribution, farm labor, market research, consumer decision-making drivers, and other topics. Authors are encouraged to submit applied research papers, commentary, and thought-provoking articles that inform the emerging field of agriculture and food systems development. Faculty and students, Extension and other educators, planners, consultants, staff with farm agencies and farm and community organiza&amp;shy;tions, and farmers are invited to submit material.For both calls, manuscripts should focus on the practical application of these innovations: the organization and mechanics of a program or strategy; engagement of stakeholders; challenges and unique solutions; impact analysis; and lessons learned. The Journal encourages &quot;accessible scholarship&quot; -- minimizing jargon, writing in the active voice, and addressing the interests of both practitioners and academics. These papers should inspire and inform new and existing community development efforts to establish and sustain farms. Papers that feature survey results with descriptive statistics, or case studies featuring best practices (or even post-mortem analyses), are highly encouraged. </p>
