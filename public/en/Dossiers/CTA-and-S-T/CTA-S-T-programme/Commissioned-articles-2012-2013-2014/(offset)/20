						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	According to Wals <i>et al.</i> ‘continued globalization and digitalization are not only affecting how we think, what we know, who to believe and how we act, they also affect the role of education in society’. In this regard, they attempt to answer ‘what do we educate for in such a world when things change so fast and knowledge becomes obsolete before you know it?’ For example, Wageningen University started changing their identity by positioning themselves as <i>life science universities</i>, which aspire to contribute to a better world and improved quality of life.In this feature article, Wals and colleagues provide a brief review of some trends in Tertiary Agricultural Education (TAE) within Europe and examines the world-wide shift from <i>traditional transmissive</i> to <i>emerging transformative</i> development of more dynamic competencies in a real-world setting. They note that a number of new competencies are required including: interdisciplinary problem-solving, addressing multiple stakeholder interests, participatory approaches in innovation, interactive methods in conflict resolution, responsive actions regarding community needs, critical media literacy, and social responsibility in entrepreneurship, to name a few, along with those that still connect to specific content areas (e.g. animal science, plant science, environmental science and agro-technology).
&nbsp;&nbsp;This overarching innovation taking place in tertiary agricultural education in Europe is referred to as Competence-based Education and Training (CBET). A synthesis of the requirements for new graduates as defined by the public and the related competencies that are considered relevant is presented. A case study of the ten-step re-design of the MSc curriculum in horticulture at the Jimma University Agricultural College (JUCAVM) in Ethiopia is showcased.Photo:&nbsp;&nbsp;Jimma University Agricultural College (JUCAVM); source:&nbsp;https://plus.google.com/107229457994018982305/photos?hl=en</p>

	For Kenya, integration of science, technology and innovation (ST&amp;I) into national production processes is central to the success of the Government´s policy priorities and programmes based on new innovative ideas, as outlined under Kenya Vision 2030. Traditionally, universities played a key role in the process of economic growth, as both a source of new knowledge and as a trainer of scientists and engineers who work in industries and laboratories. However, global competitiveness, the attainment of sustainable development goals and the need for timely responses, require dynamic institutions with a demonstrated capacity and willingness to innovate.
&nbsp;&nbsp;For Kenya to fully realize the national goal of becoming a knowledge-based economy, provision of a favourable policy environment which emphasizes the universities’ pivotal role in the research and innovation process and necessary financial resources for R&amp;D is a prerequisite. The universities also need to enhance collaboration with industry to be able to respond to the challenges and contribute to speeding up the innovation process. Ensuring the relevance of doctoral education, accessing financial support for research and having the right people is key.
&nbsp;The author is firmly convinced that tertiary education institutions must have a central role in the change process and that R&amp;D funding needs to be increased. The Kenyan R&amp;D sector including research institutes, universities, technical and vocational education and training and innovators will benefit and be able to focus on the national priority areas in a global context.</p>

					<p>At the global level, two thirds of the 774&nbsp;million illiterate adults are women, and this&nbsp;percentage has not improved over the past&nbsp;two decades. This is prompting some&nbsp;serious reflection and prospective thinking.&nbsp;Robert Zoellick, for example, former&nbsp;president of the World Bank, once said that&nbsp;investing in girls is not just a good thing&nbsp;but a smart thing to do. MDG Goal 3, which&nbsp;emphasizes gender equality, is most likely&nbsp;to be missed but remains a laudable&nbsp;objective. It is increasingly recognized that&nbsp;eliminating the gender gap can boost GDP&nbsp;in the United States, the Eurozone and&nbsp;Japan by 9%, 13% and 16%, respectively. In&nbsp;the BRICS, and other fast-growing&nbsp;developing countries, including Mauritius,&nbsp;the gap is already narrowing.&nbsp;</p>

	By Calestous Juma and Yee-Cheong <i>Lee&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;</i><i>Co-chairs of the UN Millennium Project's Task Force on Science, Technology and Innovation&nbsp;</i>
<i>&nbsp;</i>In this new lead article, Prof. Calestous Juma, Harvard University and Prof. Yee-Cheong Lee, UNESCO, reflect on the progress made since the UN Millennium Project's Task Force report on science, technology and innovation (ST&amp;I) was published. In 2005, the Task Force released the report <a href="http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/documents/Science-complete.pdf" target="_self"><b><i>Innovation: applying knowledge in development</i></b></a>. It outlined a number of ways in which ST&amp;I could be used to realize the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The authors claim that the report has played a key catalytic role in raising global awareness of the importance of ST&amp;I in development.&nbsp;
&nbsp;Prior to this, ST&amp;I for economic development was considered to be relevant only to industrialized countries, and often discouraged in developing countries, neither was it a priority for the UN, as it was identified as '<i>Target 18 of Goal 8 - the very last target of the very last goal</i>'. However, much has changed and the <b>innovation systems approach</b>, which included infrastructure, more advanced technical training and entrepreneurship was presented as a framework for thought and action. While the concept of ST&amp;I for development has gained momentum, the authors are of the view that much more still needs to be done by developing countries to ensure that ST&amp;I achieves greater impact on alleviating hunger, poverty, illiteracy and ill health, political and social upheavals.&nbsp;</p>

					<p><i>By Norman Uphoff, Cornell University&nbsp;</i>
<i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;<i>Synthesis Report of the ACP-EU Think Tank on S&amp;T for ACP Agricultural and Rural Development - Partnerships for Research, Capacity Building, Innovation and Foresighting: Managing Water for Agriculture and Food in ACP Countries. </i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Uphoff notes that relative water scarcity is growing at an alarming rate and it is the efficient and effective management of water that must help ACP countries, where agriculture remains primarily rain-fed, cope with scarcities and surfeits. In reflecting on the contemporary experiences that the ACP-EU Think tank deliberated on in their annual 2012 meeting, Prof. Uphoff noted that the more '<b>efficient use</b> of water can, in effect, expand its <b>supply</b>, while on the other hand, the <b>more productive use</b> of water can ease the <b>demand</b> or <b>need</b> by giving farmers &quot;more crop per drop&quot;'. He makes a plea for more contemporary thinking and approaches to addressing water for agriculture and suggests a softer focus to embrace the concept of water governance.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of 'grey water', grasping how to harness the genetic potential and inter-species synergies for agricultural success as part of the evolution of &quot;modern agriculture&quot;, paying attention to beneficial micro-climates, maintaining soil cover and water pricing and water quality issues are all addressed in this report.&nbsp;</p>

	This&nbsp;CTA commissioned report reviews the impacts that state marketing boards and agencies have had on the agricultural sector. The broad findings are that state boards and agencies are generally operating within a set of traditional parameters and are required to respond to often quite different commercial, regulatory and policy agendas at the same time. These agendas are to a large extent no longer relevant in the 21st century, and often lead to confusion in achieving the desired outcomes. In addition, such entities tend to be ‘followers’ rather than ‘leaders’ and innovators. Their contribution to creating value and improving food and nutrition security in the region has not been significant and the Caribbean has become a net importer of food.[CTA REPORTS: ADDING VALUE TO LOCAL FOODS FOR FOOD AND NUTRITION SECURITY: MYTH OR STRATEGIC OPTION]<i>Image:Empire Marketing Board (1927) poster 'Highways of Empire' by Macdonald Gill (1927);&nbsp;</i><i>Source: UK National Archives.&nbsp;Catalogue reference: CO 956/537.</i></p>

	The rise in chronic non-communicable nutrition related diseases in the Caribbean accompanied by spiraling health care costs has occurred parallel with changing dietary patterns. For example, the total direct and indirect costs of treating obesity related diseases in five countries in 2003 was estimated to be US$1,000 million.Coming from an era of protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) when food choices favoured energy density (high fat, sugar and protein), coupled with many external influences, Caribbean people have become conditioned to a diet not considered to be healthy.&nbsp; We are now faced with the double burden of under-nutrition (pockets of PEM and iron deficiency anaemia persist) and over-nutrition (cancers, diabetes, hypertension) which threatens to erode all efforts at achieving food and nutrition security.&nbsp;To achieve food and nutrition security requires more insight into the causes of the problem through further research, and more collaborative multi-sectoral efforts.&nbsp; Only by working together will the various sectors (agriculture, health and nutrition, trade, education, science and innovation) achieve the collective objective of improved agricultural and nutrition outcomes.</p>

	Over the last decade, remote sensing has developed in various ways, strongly increasing its potential as a tool to support integrated agricultural management and sustainable rural development.First of all, geometric or spatial resolution has improved which implies that smaller details on the ground become visible, allowing for a better view of vegetation and its surrounding environment. Second, the improvement of the radiometric or spectral resolution combined with the integral use of information from different spectral channels allows a more accurate analysis and interpretation of the Remote Sensing data in terms of: type of crop, soil type, state of growth, and presence of disease. Moreover, this aspect facilitates the use of Remote Sensing data under less favourable atmospheric conditions. Thirdly, the number of operational Remote Sensing platforms is growing, which allows for almost continuous monitoring at a worldwide scale.Finally, the internet with its ever increasing capabilities has strongly facilitated the availability of Remote Sensing data and derived data and information products to users, even in remote places.</p>

	Sustainable improvement of human well-being depends crucially on knowledge, its production, organisation, distribution, appropriation and wise use. Access to information, the capacity to generate and use scientific and technological knowledge and human innovation give institutions and countries an edge. For ACP countries, past development efforts that ignored local circumstances, technologies and systems of knowledge wasted enormous amounts of time and resources and have failed to achieve the desired result: <i>&quot;sustainable development&quot;.</i></p>

	In his article, Oluwatoyin Kolawole highlights key issues on the peculiarities of Africa’s soils and how they affect agricultural production. He argues that because of the very high diversity and spatial heterogeneity in soil type and quality across sub-Saharan Africa, a one-size-fits-all solution is inappropriate to address Africa’s divergent soil problems. Kolawole uses a number of research initiatives on integrated soil fertility management to show that Western science and local/indigenous knowledge are not mutually exclusive in driving sustainable management practices and improving yields on small farms.&nbsp;</p>

	Amir Kassam in his lead article argues that the no-till farming system involving soil cover and crop diversification, known as Conservation Agriculture (CA), is fundamentally changing farming practices and management of the land resource base, the landscape and the environment. As a proponent of this approach, Kassam notes that CA enhances ecosystem services and resilience, and offers additional economic and environmental benefits that are difficult or impossible to mobilize with conventional tillage agriculture.&nbsp;In his view, CA fits within the sustainable intensification paradigm which when defined in its broadest sense, encompasses production and ecological dimensions, the biological products produced and utilized by consumers and with minimum food waste, as well as the human and economic dimensions of socio-cultural aspirations, organizations and social equity and economic growth.According to Kassam, CA is not intensification in the classical sense of greater use of inputs but rather the intensification of knowledge, skills and management practices and the complementary judicious use of other inputs. He sees the new challenge for science and policy in the 21st Century as being able to produce more from less and with minimum damage and to rehabilitate degraded and or abandoned lands while conserving and optimizing the use of the remaining water and biodiversity resources.&nbsp;CA is now being practiced on 125 million hectares (about 9% of cropland) across all continents, and approximately 50% lies in the developing countries, including in African countries, namely Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Kassam believes that CA can contribute to the goal of sustainable intensification, but more research and extension effort is needed to inform policy formulation and development strategies.&nbsp;</p>

	The need for policy and institutional support to develop an integrated seed system that really serves African smallholders is explained. Mekelle University (MU) is the key implementing partner for the Integrated Seed Sector Development (ISSD) programme in the Tigray region, Ethiopia, where farmers rely heavily on the traditional seed system. MU works with farmers, consumers, other public institutions and private companies to develop interventions using seeds of local crops as opposed to the varieties (e.g. hybrid maize) that are favoured by commercial enterprises involved in the formal seed sector.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>In recent years, public-private partnerships have been promoted as a model for attracting investments, optimising resources, improving efficiency and enhancing delivery and impact of interventions aimed at improving the performance of the agricultural sector, especially in developing countries. The Eastern Africa Seed Committee (EASCOM) exemplifies a public-private partnership that evolved to address the gaps in policy and practice regarding production and trade in seed across 11 countries in eastern and central Africa. This article discusses how EASCOM was formed, its mandate, operational mechanisms and achievements, and reviews how EASCOM prioritised the agenda for seed policy harmonisation and the factors and resources that were harnessed to generate successful outcomes. &nbsp;</p>

	Agricultural production is being impacted by changes in climate, ecology and the environment. At the same time, agricultural intensification, population growth, urbanisation and industrialisation also impact upon the ecology and environment. In this context, achieving ecological sustainability is often seen as a desirable goal. But what is ecological sustainability? The meaning appears to be different when viewed through the lenses of various experts e.g. environmentalists, sociologists or economists. Nevertheless it is essential to have a clear understanding of what is meant in a specific situation or context. This goal may be as elusive as the goal of “sustainable development” for which several, sometimes contradicting definitions exist, and for which consensus on how to attain it, still has not been reached.</p>

	Irrigation is responsible for about 70-80% of freshwater depletion in most developing countries. According to Lankford's article, worldwide, agriculture evapotranspires approximately 20-25 km3 of water per day and the 270-300 million hectare irrigated component of this evaporates about 6-9 km3 of water per day. Rain fed cropping consumes soil water and the range of measures available to manage soil water depletion is limited compared to that for irrigated cropping. As such, agricultural productivity can be boosted by using water more efficiently. Irrigation is believed to 'waste' significant amounts of water; worldwide, irrigation is about 40% efficient. It appears that effective efficiency can be increased by 10-20% (and more) by adopting new technologies or adapting existing practices from water-short farmers. A multi-pronged systems approach is recommended for delivering substantial and verifiable reductions in water consumption over large areas of irrigated lands.&nbsp;Lankford explains that improving irrigation performance involves simultaneous consideration of technological, social and economic points of view. The aim is to achieve this at a reasonable cost using technologies and ideas appropriate for, or already practiced by, irrigators with support from external engineers. Key dimensions of a broader approach include; (a) understanding the need for diverse solutions and assessing diversity and spectrum of irrigation types; (b) mixing and merging local and expert knowledge; (c) capping withdrawals and agreeing the purpose and destination that 'saved' water volumes are reserved for; and (d) comprehensively measuring water use efficiency and monitoring water flows.</p>

	This study provides data and analysis on the two most important factors influencing reproductive rate in cattle – nutrition and breed type – in the context of smallholder dairy herds in Africa. Paterson’s report is an assessment of the options available to small farmers. It provides an overview of pertinent and published research, and also specific insight into the efforts scientists from ILRI and national research centres are making in South Africa, Swaziland, Ethiopia and Kenya. The focus is on enhancing the earning potential of the smallholder dairy farmers.&nbsp;Regarding animal nutrition, profits rise with the use of indigenous products and losses come from using imported feed. It is therefore important to maximise the use of existing arable land, crop residue, leguminous forage, low quality roughages and protein supplements. To provide milk off-season – which sells at a higher price – farmers must develop a viable all year round feeding strategy and plan for quality crop residues when and where possible. Low productivity from tropical feedstuffs may well ask for the supplementation of high bypass proteins to balance the protein-to- energy ratio in these feeds, an exacting but necessary option for smallholders who’d like to sell milk all year.Dairy genetics is also crucial to the success of the smaller dairy businesses. The evolution of cows on the continent resulted in a relatively small animal adapted to hot climate and nutritional stress. The local African breeds require an infusion of dairy genetics to improve their milking potential: this has been successfully achieved through artificial insemination (AI) in many countries, and recently AI was combined with synchronisation of oestrus (sexual receptivity) in Ethiopia. Introducing genes associated with milk productivity could produce animals unadapted to the environmental constraints. Nevertheless the introduction of desirable milk genetics through the smaller New Zealand Jersey breed (which produces milk off grass) appears to be a better choice than the Holstein (which produces excessive quantities of milk off concentrate). A key recommendation for further consideration is the use of semen from Jersey crosses rather than from the Holsteins standing at the AI stations. However, there is still a need for specific studies on genotype x nutrition x disease interactions when developing new cattle breeds for the continent.&nbsp;There is high demand for milk and meeting this demand will require the use locally adapted dairy cattle breeds and a well thought-out feeding strategy. Also necessary is a dedicated scientific community, effective extension support systems, an enabling policy environment and smallholder farmers who have the required entrepreneurial spirit. &nbsp;Read the synthesis report below and find the article <a href="/en/Dossiers/Commodities/Livestock/Feature-articles/Utilising-indigenous-breeds-Improving-the-reproductive-potential-of-smallholder-dairy-herds-article" target="_self">here</a>.</p>

	In this new lead article, Don Peden, highlights key research findings from a project in the Nile River Basin and explains how the results can improve understanding of livestock water productivity (LWP), and build policy that takes into account this new knowledge. The results are drawn primarily from the CGIAR Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture and Challenge Program on Water and Food.&nbsp;LWP takes an interdisciplinary agro-ecosystems approach to achieve more effective, sustainable and productive use of agricultural water for animal production. It calls for better feed sourcing and management, adoption of best-bet animal production technology, and improved water conservation. LWP is a scale-dependent concept: the elements of the hydrological cycle are studied within a specific spatiotemporal window. It represents the ratio of the total value of goods and services derived from domestic animals to the amount of water depleted as a cost of livestock-keeping.According to Peden, there are basic LWP-enhancing strategies. These include, feed sourcing and management strategies that require the use of feeds with a low water cost of production such as using crop residues which need no additional water. Another is the use of water-conserving strategies which shift evaporation to transpiration, for example by reducing overgazing and improving pasture management. Strategically allocating spatial and temporal distributions of livestock, drinking water and feed resources whichÂ&nbsp;also allow for sustainability in animal production, should also be considered.&nbsp;&nbsp;Achieving LWP requires a better understanding of the local situation, and access to and an appropriate mix of technology, training and education, community participation, investment, marketing opportunities and coherent governance.</p>
