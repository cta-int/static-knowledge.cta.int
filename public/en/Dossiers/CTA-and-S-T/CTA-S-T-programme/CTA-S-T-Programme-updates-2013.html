						<dt><a href="../../S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation.html">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>The innovation systems (IS) concept has been used by industrialized nations to&nbsp;inform policies to support their economic&nbsp;growth, development and competitiveness&nbsp;agendas. For example, a Dutch policy think&nbsp;tank, noted that while the Netherlands&nbsp;ranked 8th in the Global Competitiveness&nbsp;Index, the Dutch innovation system faced&nbsp;several challenges that needed to be&nbsp;addressed by policy.It recommended: (i)&nbsp;increasing ‘the levels of output and quality&nbsp;in higher education, a more ambitious&nbsp;learning culture and a research climate that&nbsp;fosters excellence’; (ii) strengthening ‘the&nbsp;innovative capacity of Dutch (small and&nbsp;medium-sized) companies and improving&nbsp;the relationships between the public&nbsp;knowledge institutes and the private sector&nbsp;(especially SMEs)’ and; (iii) creating ‘a more&nbsp;attractive business and investment climate&nbsp;and more room for entrepreneurial&nbsp;activities’.</p>

					<p>Venue: CTA Headquarters, Wageningen, The Netherlands --Dates: 25-27&nbsp;September 2013 --The role of universities and other tertiary education institutions in socio-economic development is being reconceptualised. They are increasingly being called upon to move beyond training and the pursuit of knowledge and become more strategic assets with strong forward and backward linkages to the productive sectors to expand their reach and increase their impact at community and national level. For pragmatic reasons, CTA and Wageningen UR in collaboration with ACP universities, partner networks and organizations have chosen food and nutrition security as the initial content domain to determine the extent of engagement of ACP tertiary education institutes in ARD policy processes. This is one of the most pressing issues nationally, regionally and internationally and universities are currently looking for ways to (re)orient their education and training, research and community outreach programmes to remain relevant. &nbsp;--&nbsp;<a href="../../../Media/Multimedia/Poster-Mainstreaming-Tertiary-Education-in-ACP-ARD-Policy-Processes.html" target="_self">Download the poster</a>.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>The CTA/WUR project on “Mainstreaming Tertiary Education in ARD Policy Processes” is gaining momentum. Food security audits of university programmes to determine how they are aligned with food security policies and programmes have begun. Professor Arjen and Drs. Bello, Wageningen University and Research centre in collaboration with Dr Newton Nyairo, Kenyatta University conducted the first audit at Kenyatta University, Nairobi, Kenya in early February. The AISHE tool that was co-developed by CTA, WUR and partner universities and networks, was used for undertaking the audits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Nyairo said “<i>In my opinion and in the opinions of our guests, it was a successful event. We managed to gather both students and lecturers and we had good facilitation in carrying out the self-assessment</i>”. Audits were also conducted at Sokoine University, Tanzania and The University of the West Indies, St Augustine Campus, Trinidad and Tobago during the month of Ferbruary. The audit of the University of the South Pacific’s curriculum, research and outreach programme will take place in Fiji in early March 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier: <a href="../Developments/CTA-WUR-ACP-Universities-begin-audits-Mainstreaming-tertiary-education-in-ACP-ARD-policy-processes-Increasing-food-supply-and-reducing-hunger.html" target="_self">http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/CTA-WUR-ACP-Universities-begin-audits-Mainstreaming-tertiary-education-in-ACP-ARD-policy-processes-Increasing-food-supply-and-reducing-hunger</a></p>

					<p>As part of its contribution to the multi-partnership ISSD project, CTA is supporting African universities to undertake assessments of their role in integrated seed sector development to enhance their contribution to policy processes governing seed systems in Africa.On March 08, Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR) (LUANAR) will host its national university seminar to share the results of the study on their university’s role in seed sector development in Malawi.&nbsp; The university representative focused on three projects to analyze their contribution to seed sector development. The bean seed multiplication project was a typical multidisciplinary research project which included releasing varieties, providing support on seed production and engaging and empowering farmers in the process. The second mushroom project includes oyster mushroom seed multiplication, and technical backstopping for farmers and farmer groups in production, training and marketing. The third project involves the contribution of an economist from the Centre for Agricultural Research and Development, in evaluating the use of vouchers in ISSD.&nbsp; The analysis showed that there is need for greater focus on basic research, policy research, and more advocacy/briefing notes.The results will be discussed during the national seminar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More about ISSD:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wageningenur.nl/en/show/Integrated-seed-sector-development-in-Africa.htm" target="_self">http://www.wageningenur.nl/en/show/Integrated-seed-sector-development-in-Africa.htm</a></p>

The audits will take place<b> </b>in February 2013 in Kenya, Tanzania, Fiji and Trinidad and Tobago. These will be followed by audits in Burkina Faso, Niger and Senegal in March/April.The project-team comprising experts from WUR and the ACP partner university will carry out the institutional analysis, using the Auditing Instrument for Sustainability in Higher Education (AISHE) which the team members have developed. This includes a review of the curriculum that supports ARD policy objectives as they relate to food security. This will also provide an overview of events and trial and error activities that have been occurring in the past. The following questions will be answered: What is being done within the university to address the increase of food supplies and the reduction of hunger? What portfolio of activities and provisions (including, policies, capacity development efforts, existing curricula with courses, modules, research programmes, community outreach, etc.) are already in place for trying to achieve the prioritized ARD goals?</p>

					<p>Is cassava the crop of the future for food and nutrition security and industrial development? Not unless, we increase investments in science, technology and innovation. An interesting presentation on the Global Cassava Partnership for the 21st century (GCP 21) by Dr Claude Fauquet at CTA Headquarters on 28 March 2013 triggered further reflection on the need for a coordinated approach to cassava development.
  Dr Fauquet indicated that 105 countries produce cassava; 50% of which are in Africa where surface area is almost double that of Asia and Latin America. However, yield is lower (10t/ha) as compared to 12t/ha and 19t/ha in Latin America and Asia, respectively. What is the role of African universities and research organisations in driving the research and development agenda for cassava on the continent? Which organisations are studying future consumer and industry trends for cassava?
  Which are leading programmes on: (i) documenting and characterising cassava landraces, farmer knowledge and practices; (ii) the performance of various varieties and landraces under changing climatic conditions including for drought and pest resistance; (iii) new product development for food and other industrial uses; (iv) increasing yield potential; (v) standardising height of plants (dwarf varieties) and size of roots to support industry expansion for food products, starch or animal feed etc.?
  Work is going on at some leading international centres and in collaboration with national R&amp;D organisations to produce virus-free varieties through genetic engineering and on rapid multiplication but while these are critical research areas, the success of a cassava ‘green revolution’ in Africa or world-wide requires interlinked thinking, an innovation systems approach, foresight, investments in science and engineering, an enabling policy and institutional framework and visionary leadership from scientists/academicians, policy/governments and the private sector including farmers.</p>

CTA supported the participation of knowledge institutes, mainly six African universities; the Universities of Burundi, Ghana and Zambia, Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources - Malawi, Makerere University - Uganda and Mekelelee University - Ethiopia, in the project.Each university representative undertook a case study on the university's contribution to innovation in the national seed system and then presented the results to a national forum comprising university peers and public and private sector officials involved in the national seed system. Outcomes and lessons from assessments undertaken by the ISSD national task forces were also presented during the university seminars.Some of the key lessons learned by the universities at individual and institutional levels included the need for: (i) integrating informal (familial) seed systems in their research, teaching and outreach especially given their importance to food security and the conservation and optimization of indigenous genetic resources to minimize biodiversity erosion; (ii) greater coordination of research and teaching undertaken within the university for achieving greater impact; (iii) increased networking and sharing of knowledge and experiences among universities within countries and across regions; (iv) including seed policy and legal issues and for curricula review and; (v) universities to play a greater role in influencing national and regional policy processes as they relate to seed sector development in Africa as well as internationally.CTA will continue to work with African universities and network partners in their efforts aimed at strengthening the informal seed systems and supporting innovations that address hunger, poverty and climate change challenges.Previous notes on the ISSD initiative can be found <a href="../Developments/Integrated-seed-sector-development-issd-in-africa-practices-programmes-and-policies-for-seed-entrepreneurship.html" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;(March 2013) and <a href="../Developments/Integrated-Seed-Sector-Development-ISSD-in-Africa-Phase-II-Practices-Programmes-and-Policies-for-Seed-Entrepreneurship.html" target="_blank">here</a> (October 2012).Download&nbsp;<a href="../../../Media/Multimedia/Ongoing-and-planned-CTA-activities-in-Seed-Sector-Development-in-Africa-ISSD-Ghana-April-2013.html" target="_blank">Judith Francis' presentation on CTA planned and ongoing work</a>&nbsp;in Seed Sector Development in Africa (ISSD Ghana April 2013).Download the&nbsp;<a href="../../../Media/Multimedia/Integrated-Seed-Sector-Development-ISSD-Africa-Newsletter-4-April-2013.html" target="_blank">newsletter ISSD Africa no 4</a>&nbsp;of April 2013.</p>

The Education and Competence Studies Group and the <a href="http://www.wageningenur.nl/csdfs" target="_blank">Centre for Sustainable Development &amp; Food Security</a> of Wageningen University and Research Centre, the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU (CTA), ten universities in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific and African regional university networks (ANAFE, RUFORUM, TEAM Africa) collaborated in developing the Auditing Instrument for Food Security in Higher Education (AIFSHE) open source tool.</p>

	The decision to host the Africa-wide science competitions targeting African women and young professionals in science was taken by the FARA General Assembly at its 4th meeting in South Africa in 2007. Professor Monty Jones, the former executive director, FARA had readily agreed to partner with CTA, ANAFE, RUFORUM and the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency in hosting these competitions. The Finals of the 2nd round of competitions was held at the 5th FARA GA in Burkina Faso and the decision was taken by the GA to continue to organize the science competitions. In 2012, the partnership was expanded to include the International Foundation for Science (IFS), Sweden.&nbsp;Find the abstracts here:&nbsp;<a href="../../../../Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/Abstracts-CTA-FARA-IFS-ANAFE-RUFORUM-NPCA-AGRA-3rd-Africa-wide-Women-and-Young-Professionals-in-Science-Competitions.html" target="_self">http://knowledge.cta.int/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/Abstracts-CTA-FARA-IFS-ANAFE-RUFORUM-NPCA-AGRA-3rd-Africa-wide-Women-and-Young-Professionals-in-Science-Competitions</a>Update:<a href="../../../../Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/6th-Africa-Science-Week-and-FARA-General-Assembly-Side-Event-Programme-for-Finals-of-3rd-Africa-wide-Science-competitions.html" target="_self">&nbsp;6th Africa Science Week and FARA General Assembly Side Event: Programme for Finals of 3rd Africa-wide Science competitions</a>Update:&nbsp;<a href="../../../../Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/Top-20-finalists-of-the-3rd-Africa-wide-women-and-young-professionals-in-science-competitions.html" target="_self">Top 20 finalists of the 3rd Africa-wide women and young professionals in science competitions</a>Update: <a href="../../../../Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/ACP-young-professionals-and-women/Update-October-2012-CTA-FARA-IFS-ANAFE-RUFORUM-NEPAD-AGRA-3rd-Africa-Wide-Women-and-Young-Professionals-in-Science-Competitions.html" target="_self">October 2012, CTA/ FARA/ IFS/ ANAFE/ RUFORUM/ NEPAD/ AGRA 3rd Africa Wide Women and Young Professionals in Science Competitions</a></p>

CTA is a partner in the CAAST-Net Plus project and leads on Work Package WP 1.1. Tasks assigned to this work package aim to contribute to the structuring and strengthening of the cooperation in food and nutrition security (FNS) research and innovation between Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa. More precisely, WP1 is designed to: (i) assess the impact of Africa-Europe collaborative research on joint food security priorities, (ii) contribute to bridging the public-private gap for the dissemination and exploitation of research results, (iii) foster a Europe-Africa multi-actor platform for researchable joint priorities. &nbsp;Get the report <a href="../../../Media/Multimedia/Report-of-CAAST-Net-Plus-High-level-Policy-Dialogue-Side-Event-November-28-Brussels.html" target="_self">here</a>.</p>
