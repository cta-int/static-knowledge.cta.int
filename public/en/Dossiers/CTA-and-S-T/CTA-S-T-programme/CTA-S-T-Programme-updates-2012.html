						<dt><a href="../../S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation.html">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>The report of the 10th meeting of ACP/EU think tank comprising senior level ACP and EU scientists, policymakers and other key stakeholders in the Commonwealth of Dominica from 9–13 October, 2011 is now available. The theme of the meeting was ‘Science and Technology for ACP Agricultural &amp; Rural Development: Safeguarding the ACP Food System through Science, Technology and Innovation’. The Advisory Committee concluded that ACP countries face a daunting challenge regarding food and nutrition security and climate change and need to act urgently by adopting systematic, focused and evidence-based approaches in partnership with strategic allies (north-south and south-south). The opportunity for the private sector to fund research also needs to be tapped. The AC agreed that, there is clear evidence that research and development are central to agricultural reform and modernization and for increased national funding to support public sector research and for leveraging the best in international scientific cooperation. There is also the critical issue of data and information gaps to support development of evidence-based approaches to inform policy and action: e.g. points along the value chain where post harvest losses occur; the different attributes of different commodities; and market intelligence and the use of foresight methods, to be applied. Analysing postharvest knowledge systems was considered a priority within the context of the ACP food system.<a href="../Selected-events/10th-Meeting-of-the-Advisory-Committee-on-Science-and-Technology-for-ACP-Agricultural-Rural-Development.html" target="_blank">Click to access earlier documents and key notes related to the 10th meeting</a>.</p>

Deadline: 14 May 2012.</b>The CTA/ FARA/IFS/ ANAFE/ RUFORUM consortium, in collaboration with AGRA and NPCA, is pleased to announce the launch of its 2012-2013 Africa-wide women and young professionals in science competitions. With a population of approximately 1.03 billion in 2011, and a growth rate of 24 million per annum, Africa’s population is expected to double by 2050. The continent needs to increase agricultural productivity in a sustainable manner as well as find endogenous solutions to respond to the challenges. Africa’s investment in science and innovation remains low; and only one African university is listed among the top 500 in the world. Women are under-represented in all areas of policy, education and research and many of Africa’s youthful population; 70%<b> </b>aged 30 or younger, do not see a future in agriculture or science. The continent faces a knowledge and skills gap as ageing scientists and academicians retire.<b> </b>The 2012-2013 Africa-wide competitions will evaluate, recognize and reward the contributions of women and young professionals who are involved in:<b> (i) </b>Pioneering and innovative research;<b> (ii) </b>Communicating their research results and technological developments; and<b> (iii) </b>Advocating for policy change as well as influencing policy processes through their research.<b> </b>They will also raise awareness of the need for valuing and sustaining the engagement of women and young professionals and facilitating their contribution to Africa’s socio-economic transformation.<b>Get the Women in Science competition announcement here (updated as of May 15th, 2012)</b>: English version <a href="../../../content/view/full/15382.html" target="_blank">http://knowledge.cta.int/en/content/view/full/15382</a>Version française <a href="../../../../fr/content/view/full/15382.html" target="_blank">http://knowledge.cta.int/fr/content/view/full/15382</a><b>Get the Young Professional in Science competition announcement here (updated as of May 15th, 2012)</b>English version <a href="../../../content/view/full/15383.html" target="_blank">http://knowledge.cta.int/en/content/view/full/15383</a>Version française <a href="../../../../fr/content/view/full/15383.html" target="_blank">http://knowledge.cta.int/fr/content/view/full/15383</a><b>Read the related concept note here</b>:English Version <a href="../../../Media/Multimedia/Concept-Note-2012-2013-Africa-Wide-Women-and-Young-Professionals-in-Science-Competition.html" target="_blank">http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Media/Multimedia/Concept-Note-2012-2013-Africa-Wide-Women-and-Young-Professionals-in-Science-Competition</a>Version française <a href="../../../../fr/Media/Multimedia/Concept-Note-2012-2013-Africa-Wide-Women-and-Young-Professionals-in-Science-Competition.html" target="_blank">http://knowledge.cta.int/fr/Media/Multimedia/Concept-Note-2012-2013-Africa-Wide-Women-and-Young-Professionals-in-Science-Competition</a></p>

					<p>In November 2011, CTA, in collaboration with ANAFE and several partners, hosted a CAADP sensitization conference in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso for rectors and senior-level officials from French-speaking tertiary agricultural education institutes in Africa. The objectives of the workshop were to: (i) Sensitize leaders of universities and other agricultural higher education institutions and their partners to the CAADP and its processes (ii) Improve the involvement of African universities and agricultural higher education institutions; (iii) Develop a regional action plan to reinforce the involvement of universities and other African agricultural higher education institutions into the CAADP processes; (iv) Define the accompanying measures to increase the involvement of universities and other French-speaking agricultural higher education institutions. A number of papers including a draft CTA/WUR methodology for engaging universities in CAADP were presented, debated and discussed, and propositions were made. The following were achieved: (i) An increased awareness of the objectives, the constraints and the expected outputs of the CAADP; (ii) A better understanding of the role of universities and other agricultural higher education institutions in cooperation with their supervisory ministries and those in charge of agriculture; (iii) Increased willingness to be involved in the attainment of the CAADP objectives.</p>

					<p>Kevin Richard Bhall has a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of the West Indies. His winning film titled ´Nightmare 2020´ was done in the medium of hand-drawn animation, which he drew and co-written by Bhall and Aaron Ramsingh (both of whom are citizens of Trinidad and Tobago). The novel aspects of the film relates to an apocalyptic vision of Trinidad and Tobago. Based on global trends and predictions of the effects of global warming, the visuals of the film ´Nightmare 2020´ attempt to demonstrate a picture of Trinidad and Tobago if these effects continue unchecked. It is hoped to bring these global issues closer to home and to encourage people to actively choose to make proper informed decisions, regarding the development of their country on every scale. Their hope is that the film inspires people to be more aware of the local issues regarding climate change, so that they may choose to make contributions, in any and every way, to the fields of agriculture and science within the region.</p>

					<p>The Training and Visit (T&amp;V) system was the principal agricultural extension approach in Benin from 1985 to 1999. This approach was based on producing large amounts of purely technical advice, using standardised, detailed and rigorously monitored schedules of contact farmer visits and staff training sessions. T&amp;V drew heavily on the adoption and diffusion of innovation. However, farmers were dissatisfied with these extension activities because their real needs were not taken into account, and there were calls for changes in the traditional public extension systems, which were seen as outdated, top-down, paternalistic, inflexible, bureaucratic and inefficient, and therefore less able to cope with the dynamic demands of modern agriculture.</p>

					<p>Sweet potato is a food security crop for smallholder farmers in Eastern Africa. Pest and disease constraints are the most important biotic stresses, with viral diseases being the most devastating. Through a focus-group discussion, it was established that lack of clean sweet potato planting vines is a major constraint in production. Consequently, most farmers establish a new crop from virus-infected volunteer plants or an old sweet potato crop. </p>

					<p>CTA recently identified a team of consultants to lead a project to review established practice and assess opportunities to improve the reproductive performance of smallholder dairy cows in the context of sub-Saharan Africa. This also includes a technical and economic feasibility of oestrus synchronization in smallholder dairy cows kept under Ethiopian conditions. The lead consultant, Dr Alastair Gavin Paterson, and his assistant Mr. Louis le Roex of Paterson Agri-Services, South Africa were chosen for the assignment. The project includes two lots (Lot A and Lot B).<b>Lot A</b>: <i>Opportunities to improve the reproductive performance of smallholder dairy cows in Africa</i>.<b>Lot B</b>: <i>Technical and Economic Evaluation of Oestrus synchronization in Ethiopia</i>.Professor Arthur Lishman, a top reproductive physiologist in South Africa is also an advisor to the consulting group. Given the extensive knowledge of the team on reproductive physiology and the realities of the dairy sector in Africa, CTA is confident that this project will contribute to improving the performance of smallholder dairy cows and the wider dairy industry in sub-Saharan Africa as well as provide lessons for policy and practice in the wider ACP region.Click the link below to read <a href="../Developments/Call-for-Tender-and-Terms-of-Reference-Limited-Market-Consultation-Smallholder-Dairy-Consultancy-Deadline-27-July-2012.html" target="_self">the original call</a>.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Dates:&nbsp;18-21 September &nbsp;2012Venue: CTA Headquarters, Wageningen, The Netherlands<b>UPDATE NOVEMBER 2012</b>:<i>The workshop report has been published. Find it <a href="../../../Media/Multimedia/Report-of-the-CTA-WUR-Inception-Workshop-on-Mainstreaming-Tertiary-Education-in-ACP-ARD-Policy-Processes-Increasing-Food-Supply-and-Reducing-Hunger.html" target="_self">here</a>.&nbsp; </i>CTA and WUR in collaboration with ACP partner networks and organizations have chosen food security as the initial content domain to determine the extent of engagement of ACP tertiary education institutes in ARD policy processes. Firstly, this is one of the most pressing issues nationally, regionally and internationally and universities are currently looking for ways to (re)orient their education, research and community outreach towards addressing food security. Secondly, food security links to the core business of Wageningen University and its recently established Centre for Sustainable Development and Food Security. Thirdly, capacity development is seen as a key strategic intervention area and designing and piloting methodologies for learning lessons for enhancing the engagement of tertiary education institutes in ARD policy processes specifically CAADP and the major ARD policy instruments in the Caribbean and Pacific are deemed necessary by CTA.The objective of the inception workshop is to generate consensus, understanding and commitment with respect to the project’s ambitions and methods for mainstreaming tertiary education in ACP ARD policy processes with a focus on increasing food supply and reducing hunger.</p>

					<p>The Technical Centre for Agriculture and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU (CTA), proposes to build upon the strengths of phase 1 of The Integrated Seed Sector Development (ISSD) project which was carried out by a consortium led by the Centre for Development Innovation of Wageningen UR, the African Union Commission /African Seed and Biotechnology Programme, Plantum NL and, Self Help Africa (SHA) and support the engagement of African universities in Phase II of the project. The Objective of Phase II is to strengthen the development of a vibrant, commercial and pluralistic seed sector in Africa. &nbsp;Specifically, the objective will be to (i) conduct a survey and assess practices of seed entrepreneurs at multiple scales; (ii) assess relevant programmes and policies; (iii) explore and document ways in which practices, programmes and policies can be strengthened in promoting seed entrepreneurship; (iv) enhance the capacity of seed sector professionals promoting seed entrepreneurship; (v) enhance the capacity of universities acting as facilitator and catalyst in increasing food security and promoting seed entrepreneurship.The project will operate in the following countries: Burundi, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Uganda and Zambia. Instead of a linear approach, ISSD fosters pluralism in matching food seed security to private sector development. It embraces variations among seed systems and thereby facilitates seed programmes and policies becoming coherent with the practices of farmers and a diversity of entrepreneurs in the seed sector. At the end of the ISSD Project phase I in 2010/2011, results were confirmed during national multi-stakeholder workshops. &nbsp;The main conclusions were the following: (i) The co-existence of multiple seed systems; (ii) Seed systems require targeted policies and programmes to enable their development; (iii) The seed sector in Africa faces common challenges in fine tuning roles and responsibilities of the public, private, NGO and civil sector; (iv) The transformation from Government and NGO distribution or relief seed provision to sustainable market-based systems.&nbsp;</p>
