						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>A joint research project in Uganda supported by agricultural organisations is developing a new breed of potatoes. The breed is said to be more nutritious, resistant to weevils, and can be grown across the sub-Saharan region. This would also lead to increased income for farmers because the high value sweet potatoes will have a ready market. The programme involves scientists from Namulonge Research Centre, which is run under the Sweet Potato Action for Security and Health in Africa project. The programme is funded by the $2.2 million grant, which is part of the $12 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. (Source: allAfrica.com, 21 October 2009)</p>

					<p>For the first time worldwide, free and ready-to-use high-resolution satellite data is now available to monitor forests and help reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. The monitoring system has been launched by FAO and other partners as part of the Global Forest Resources Assessment. This brings a revolution to the forest monitoring field. Never before have data of this kind been provided directly to users in developing countries. Monitoring will be cheaper, more accurate and transparent for countries that want to participate in reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. The world's forests are in the spotlight as talks for a new climate change deal move towards an agreement on how to achieve reduced emissions from forests next December in Copenhagen, Denmark. A mechanism for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) would be a breakthrough in the fight against climate change and represents one of the areas where most progress is expected in Copenhagen. It is the first time that a global forest scheme has the potential to generate such a magnitude of benefits for developing countries. A REDD mechanism would not only bring a reduced impact on climate but also much needed resources to improve livelihoods, conservation efforts and food security.

					<p>The Leeds University's Faculty of Biological Sciences is calling for the inclusion of biodiversity-friendly strategies in carbon trading schemes to ensure that carbon off-setting projects support, rather than undermine, rainforest conservation. Currently, large plantations of one type of tree, such as Eucalpytus, are popular as carbon off-setting or sequestration projects in the tropics because they also provide commercial benefits, but they do not support tropical biodiversity. A study has shown that managed restoration of logged forest - which can also be used for carbon off-setting - brings biodiversity virtually back to pre-logging levels within 15 years, much quicker than forest left to regenerate naturally. This research shows that it is possible to have both carbon sequestration and biodiversity benefits within the same scheme. (Source: University of Leeds, 20 October 2009)</p>

While the member states are yet to be finalised, a FAO funded project will be piloted in member states where the organization currently has Technical Cooperation Projects. The Caribbean Institute for Media and Communication (CARIMAC) is the regional implementation agency for the Communication for Sustainable Development Initiative (CSDI), which is a global FAO initiative that is currently ongoing in other world regions. The coordinator for the Caribbean component of CARIMAC said the project would be valuable in assisting the region’s ministries of agriculture on the road towards bridging the information divide between agricultural policy makers, the media and the public. The elements of the project to be implemented in the Caribbean are: mainstreaming communications strategies in ministries of agriculture; development training in communication for extension services officers; training in communication for farmers; and publishing.

					<p>An international seed bank has reached its target of collecting 10% of the world's wild plants, with seeds of a pink banana among its latest entries. The wild banana, <i>Musa itinerans</i>, is a favourite of wild Asian elephants. Seeds from the plant, which is under threat from agriculture, join 1.7 billion already stored by Kew's Millennium Seed Bank partnership. The project has been described as an &quot;insurance strategy&quot; against future biodiversity losses. The seed bank partnership, which involves more than 120 organisations in 54 countries, is now aiming to collect and conserve seeds from a quarter of the Earth's flowering plant species by 2020. The 10% target was set when the Wakehurst Place facility in the UK was completed in 2000. The next step is to secure another 15%, so by 2020 a quarter of the world's seeds are banked in both the country of origin and Wakehurst Place. A major focus is going to be a considerable expansion in the sustainable use of seeds for human benefit. The researchers will be focusing on food security, biodiversity loss and climate change.

					<p>The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has launched a new project that aims to increase food security for smallholder farmers in dryland areas of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The project, Harnessing Opportunities for Productivity Enhancement (HOPE) of Sorghum and Millets in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, will be undertaken by 50 partners led by ICRISAT in ten countries of sub-Saharan Africa and four states in India. HOPE is supported by an $18 million, four-year grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. Through the development and delivery of improved crop varieties and training in crop management practices, HOPE will increase small-scale farmer yields by 35 to 40% during the first four years of the project. These improved varieties of sorghum and millet will be disseminated to 110,000 households in sub-Saharan Africa and 90,000 in South Asia. Within ten years, the project should benefit more than 2 million households in these continents. Scientists estimate that yields could be doubled or even tripled from their current low levels if farmers use the right crop varieties, fertilizer and other management techniques. Capturing even a modest portion of these potential gains would generate major impacts in reducing food insecurity. (Source: African Agriculture, 16 October 2009)</p>

					<p>A biosafety network has received US$10 million to pursue its mission of helping African countries make informed choices about biotechnology. Bill Gates announced the US$10.4 million grant for the African Biosafety Network of Expertise (ABNE) during the World Food Prize Laureate Award Ceremony on October 15th. The funds form part of the foundation's US$120 million funding package for agriculture. The grant will enable ABNE to help African countries make informed decisions about delicate issues such as the growing of genetically modified crops. Among other initiatives, the network will organise workshops, offer short courses in biosafety and prepare policy briefs. The secretariat is being established in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. The biosafety network is a joint project between the NEPAD and the US-based Michigan State University (MSU). MSU will help train ABNE staff and provide up-to-date science-based information on biotechnology regulation but more than three-quarters of the grant will be spent in Africa.

					<p>Farmers in Benin are implementing their own research findings to boost the soil fertility and moisture retention of their plots. The experiment is part of the project Strengthening the Capacity to Adapt to Climate Change in Rural Benin (PARBCC) - established in late 2007 - which aims to create a three-way conversation between farmers, meteorologists and the government, and help farmers make informed choices about when to sow and harvest crops. One of the long-term goals of the programme is to teach the farming community in Benin to mobilise itself to take action against the effects of climate change. Some 300 farmers are enrolled in sixty “field schools” across the country, working with researchers to help Beninese farmers cope with droughts, tropical storms and other hazards related to climate change. The project's aim is to develop, test and implement farming strategies suited to local conditions. These include mulching, planting pits, adopting integrated crop management and using organic fertilisers. (Source: Scidev.net, 13 October 2009)</p>

					<p>The parasitic flowering plant <i>Striga</i>, or &quot;witchweed,&quot; attacks the roots of host plants, draining needed water and nutrients and leaving them unable to grow and produce any grains. Witchweed is endemic throughout sub-Saharan Africa, causing crop losses that surpass hundreds of millions of dollars annually and exacerbating food shortages in the region. Among the crops heavily parasitized by witchweed is the black-eyed pea, known in Africa as &quot;cowpea&quot; or &quot;niebe&quot; in Francophone countries. Now, scientists at the University of Virginia have identified a gene in cowpea that confers resistance to witchweed attack. This discovery will help researchers better understand how some plants can resist <i>Striga</i>, while others, such as corn and sorghum, are susceptible. Discovery of this resistance gene is not only important for improving cowpea, but may help in developing strategies for improving resistance to <i>Striga </i>in other affected crops. Currently there are no natural sources of <i>Striga</i> resistance in corn or sorghum, both of which are major cereal grains in the African diet. (Source: Science daily, 31 August 2009)</p>

					<p>2009 marks the end of an era in agricultural research. Not only has Nobel Prize-winning agronomist Norman Borlaug died, but the network of research centres with which he was closely associated is in the throes of radical reform. As concerns about rising food demands grow, CGIAR has responded to its long-felt need to change how it operates. In the early 2000s, it created a Science Council to prioritise agricultural research across the developing world and fit its collective research into a neat structure. This having failed, CGIAR this year launched a more ambitious and comprehensive reform agenda. The reform aims to provide a strategic focus and make research more efficient and relevant, boosting its impact. CGIAR also hopes to simplify its governance, enhance decentralised decision-making and provide new funding options for programmes — with plans to double its income from the current US$530 million annual budget for all 15 centres, to US$1 billion. This article questions whether this reform will be succesful. (Source: Scidev, 12 October 2009)</p>

					<p>Momentum towards the establishment of a new international body to address the loss and degradation of the world's multi trillion dollar nature-based assets gathered pace at a meeting of close to 100 governments. There was strong support that an intergovernmental panel, similar to the one that has catalyzed political action on the issue of climate change, is now needed to galvanize a change in respect to the management of biodiversity and ecosystems. Governments agreed that there was now an urgency to strengthen the link between science and policy so that the knowledge being generated by researchers across the globe is turned into action by governments on the ground. Delegates agreed that a final meeting would be held in 2010 on whether to establish an intergovernmental panel or platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services (IPBES).

					<p>Monsanto expects African countries to increase planting of genetically-modified crops to boost food security and economic development as the region is affected by climate change. For example, Burkina Faso plans to double the area planted with the company’s insect-resistant cotton next year from 129,000 hectares (318,766 acres) this year, said Natalie DiNicola (director at Monsanto’s public policy and sustainable yield division). Corn modified to tolerate drought may be introduced to the sub-Saharan region by 2017. Monsanto is introducing new modified seeds to boost yields as part of a plan to double gross profit from 2007 to 2012. Genetic modification technology will be increasingly accepted by developing countries as they face the problem of how to feed rapidly growing populations.

					<p>Fish populations in the tropics could fall by as much as 40% over the next half century because of global warming, jeopardising a vital food source for the developing world, a new study published in the Global Change Biology journal has found. The waters off Indonesia - which rank among the most plentiful areas for fish today - could see supplies fall by well over 20% by 2055 because of changes in ocean conditions. Fishermen operating in US coastal waters (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) could also face large declines in fish stocks, as would those working off Chile and China. However, not all regions would be losers. Cooler climates would see their catch potential rise by between 30% and 70% by 2055, with Norway, Greenland, Alaska and the east coast of Russia seeing the biggest increases. While the overall productivity of the world's oceans will remain roughly the same, the sharp declines in fish stocks in Asia, the Caribbean, and semi-enclosed seas like the Mediterranean could cause severe shortfalls in some of the poorest regions of the world.

					<p>The General Secretariat of the OAS is a partner organization of the US-Brazil Bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Biofuels Cooperation and is working to help implement partnership activities in the third-party countries that are beneficiaries to the MOU, including Jamaica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Guatemala, Honduras, and St Kitts and Nevis. It also supports other projects with universities and private sector groups. These project activities are aligned with the objectives described in the declaration issued by the 37th OAS General Assembly, most commonly known as the Declaration of Panama: Energy for Sustainable Development. The OAS recently issued a request for proposals for the implementation of the project <i>Technical Assistance for Biofuels Development and Policy Support in Jamaica</i>. The project aims to support the development and implementation of Jamaica’s biofuels policy and programs, establish a strong legal and regulatory framework for a vibrant liquid biofuels industry, facilitate the sharing of perspectives among the respective stakeholders, and advise on appropriate technologies.

					<p>Drought-resistant maize varieties will be making their way from the greenhouse to the field as soon as South African scientists get the regulatory green light. The researchers at the University of Cape Town in South Africa have genetically engineered maize to contain four genes from the indigenous, desiccation-resistant <i>Xerophyta viscosa</i> plant — commonly known as the 'resurrection plant'. It has taken the research team five years to identify the genes that give <i>X. viscosa</i> its ability to withstand 95 percent dehydration, and transfer this genetic material into maize. The modified plant is expected to withstand environmental conditions that currently result in a greatly reduced harvest such as late rains. (Source: Scidev, 6 October 2009)</p>

					<p>At a time when failing harvests are once again threatening the lives and livelihoods of millions across Africa, 300 agriculture scientists, entrepreneurs, farmers’ organizations and governments from across the African continent gathered to accelerate a major new effort to develop and deploy higher-yielding, drought and disease-resistant crop varieties of Africa’s most important food crops. Despite the many challenges, in the past two years PASS grantees have demonstrated that the problems are far from insurmountable. Throughout Africa, demand for improved seed is high and growing. An assessment by AGRA earlier this year found that nearly all seed producers in 13 countries have sold 100 percent of their seed. Most indicated they could have sold more. In only two years, investments in 32 small and medium-sized seed companies and cooperatives have helped them double production, from 2,656 metric tons to 5,284 metric tons. PASS hopes to see these totals rise to 10,000 tons by the end of this year. (Source: AGRA-alliance, 5 October 2009)</p>

					<p>Africa's 53 states and South America's 12 countries plan to deepen their alliances by cooperating in areas of mutual interest, including higher education, science and technology. The plan was approved by heads of state at the second Africa-South America Summit held on Venezuela's Margarita Island from 26-27 September, organised by the South American Community of Nations and the AU. Working groups were formed to promote cooperation in education, science and technology, and communications, as well as in agriculture and the environment. Responsibility for the programmes will rest with Senegal and Venezuela, Brazil and Cameroon, and Guyana and Uganda respectively. The groups will establish an education network linking the universities and institutes of the two regions. They will also initiate joint research projects, knowledge and technology transfers, exchanges of scientists and technical experts, as well as workshops, symposia and conferences.
