						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>East African farmers petitioned the African Regional Intellectual Property Organisation (ARIPO), following the latter’s proposed draft of a regional harmonised policy and legal framework on plant variety protection. The draft policy will make it mandatory for small-scale farmers in East Africa to buy all their seeds from multinational firms and stop using seeds from past harvests. The farmers’ group faults the process used to develop the draft policy and the negative impact its adoption would have on small-scale farmers, food security and on agricultural biodiversity. The draft policy will give powers to ARIPO regional offices to grant and administer breeders’ rights on behalf of all the contracting states. It also paves the way for the African Union (AU) to start discussions on the cultivation, import and export of genetically modified crops in Africa at the next AU summit to be held in January 2013. Observers and civil society representatives have criticized these developments as they have had little access to the negotiation table and are asking ARIPO to undertake comprehensive consultations with all relevant stakeholders and desist from rushing governments into adopting the draft legislation.(<a href="http://www.ip-watch.org/2012/11/05/upov-hails-benefits-of-plant-variety-protection-civil-society-frustrated/" target="_blank">IP-Watch</a>, 5/11/2012 and <i><a href="http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/EA-farmers-want-to-breed-their-own-seeds/-/2558/1644708/-/8r9kob/-/index.html" target="_blank">The East African</a></i>, 16/12/2012)</p>

The audits will take place<b> </b>in February 2013 in Kenya, Tanzania, Fiji and Trinidad and Tobago. These will be followed by audits in Burkina Faso, Niger and Senegal in March/April.The project-team comprising experts from WUR and the ACP partner university will carry out the institutional analysis, using the Auditing Instrument for Sustainability in Higher Education (AISHE) which the team members have developed. This includes a review of the curriculum that supports ARD policy objectives as they relate to food security. This will also provide an overview of events and trial and error activities that have been occurring in the past. The following questions will be answered: What is being done within the university to address the increase of food supplies and the reduction of hunger? What portfolio of activities and provisions (including, policies, capacity development efforts, existing curricula with courses, modules, research programmes, community outreach, etc.) are already in place for trying to achieve the prioritized ARD goals?</p>

					<p>Find the draft report below.The Caribbean region is a net importer of food. According to the Regional Food and Nutrition Security Policy (RPNSP), the Caribbean imported US$ 3.5 billion in both fresh and processed foods, primarily from outside the region and this is trending upwards. Changing dietary patterns and more sedentary lifestyles over the years have contributed to the high prevalence of non-communicable chronic nutrition related diseases such as diabetes, cancers and hypertension. However, pockets of malnutrition and under-nutrition still exist in some countries, particularly Haiti and Jamaica. Within the last 20 years or more, marketing boards and small and medium-scale food processing enterprises have expanded but they face several challenges; technological, logistical and financial, in accessing and processing locally grown foods e.g. root crops, fruits and vegetables, dairy, fish, poultry and other livestock. At the same time, consumers have been confronted with higher food prices for local and imported foods.In 2010, the Caribbean Research Innovation and Entrepreneurship Network (RIENet – <a href="http://www.rienet.net" target="_blank">www.rienet.net</a>) was launched following a joint CTA/CCST workshop in Jamaica in 2009. It presently comprises over 400 members and includes an online facility. About 50% of the content on the website is generated by network members from the small and medium scale enterprises, industry and public sector associations and the research and academic community. The goal of this present initiative is to leverage the RIENet and its alliances to act as a catalyst for strengthening value-addition capability and improving the food and nutrition situation in the Caribbean.Download the programme, and the presentations on cassava alternative products and on the role and impact of marketing boards.</p>

					<p>Developing countries are currently building their capacity in food-/biosafety standards and procedures while also looking into the legal frameworks that would best address and tackle the potential risks posed by new, untested technologies like genetic modification of food crops. While West Africa (ECOWAS) is drafting a strategic biosafety document, and South Africa is being criticised internally for not having a well-thought-out biosafety legislation (according to the Africa Biosafety Centre), India has decided to impose a moratorium on GM food crops cultivation in the country until its own scientists have conducted the necessary tests and analysis and established whatever there is to establish about GM food crops.<a href="http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/10/india-puts-gm-food-crops-under-microscope/" target="_blank">IPS News reports</a> on India’s move (27/10/2012)</p>

					<p>Lipid oils extracted from plants are particularly good for use in cosmetics because they are very stable and can therefore carry other oils without going rancid. Two oils extracted from seeds of sustainably wild harvested plants in Northern Namibia show great commercial promise, <a href="http://www.nri.org/news/archive/2012/20121024-lipid-oils-of-namibia.htm" target="_blank">according to the Natural Resource Institute</a> at University of Greenwich. Marula kernel oil from the common fruit tree <i>Sclerocarya birrea</i>, and Ximenia seed oil from the sourplum tree (<i>Ximenia caffra</i>), both have exciting commercial potential as cosmetic oils. Marula oil is high in anti-oxidants. Ximenia oil has particularly long fatty acids essential for making night cosmetics. The challenges this project faces are numerous: there is competition on the international market from cheaper synthetic equivalent, postharvest and extraction technique are rudimentary and further R&amp;D could improve volume and quality of lipid oils extracted from the wild trees. Also, climate variability in the long term could threaten growth and harvest of the fruits. This is a text book example of how scientists, rural communities and regional trade organisations come together to solve anaemic local economies in developing countries.(<a href="http://www.nri.org/news/archive/2012/20121024-lipid-oils-of-namibia.htm" target="_blank">NRI</a>, 24/10/2012)</p>

The survey reveals that the farmers need to diversify crop production with vegetables. In Morogoro, one of the major rice production areas of Tanzania, farmers use residue water from rice irrigation to grow vegetables for additional income. While irrigation water may be readily available, other inputs for vegetable production are not so easy to obtain, the survey reveals. It identified constraints to the production, marketing and consumption of tomato, pepper, and African eggplant and assessed common crop pests and diseases in the area and the contamination of vegetables on farms and in markets by microbes, pesticides and heavy metals. The survey found that to boost vegetable production in this region, farmers will need better access to credit and inputs such as fertiliser and seed of improved, high yielding varieties with better resistance to&nbsp;pest and diseases. Extension services also must be strengthened&nbsp;to provide farmers with a reliable&nbsp;source of information on integrated&nbsp;crop and pest management&nbsp;practices.&nbsp;The survey identified the need to&nbsp;build more robust marketing&nbsp;information systems to open&nbsp;opportunities for farmers to access&nbsp;larger, more lucrative markets such&nbsp;as supermarket chains and food&nbsp;processors. Skills development is&nbsp;another area in need of attention;&nbsp;it was noted farmers would benefit&nbsp;from training in recordkeeping and&nbsp;business management.(AVRDC <i>Fresh</i>, 25/10/2012)</p>

					<p><i>Telfairia occidentalis </i>is an indigenous vegetable consumed by millions of people in Nigeria. The seeds are in high demand as they serve as food oil for making margarine. However, commercial growers in the middle belt zone of Nigeria, source <i>telfairia</i> seeds from south-eastern states of Nigeria. The growers claimed that seeds of the accessions grown in the area are not as viable as those from southeast Nigeria. Thus, seeds are scarce and expensive at time of planting. This survey sought to examine farmers’ perception of diversity and determine the status of fluted pumpkin production as a basis for facilitating further studies, in order to help resolve the constraints to <i>telfairia</i> seed production. The results showed that the farmers, predominantly female (78%), were able to identify two cultivars ‘Ugwu-elu’ and ‘Ugwu-ala’ by their distinctive characteristics – leaves, stem, fruit and seed. The crop was produced on low ridges, with two seeds planted in a hole about 6 cm deep, at a spacing of 31 x 45 cm, giving a population of approximately 71,700 plants/ha. Mulching and fertilizer use were not practised but weeding and irrigation were undertaken. Apparently, seed production is possible in Makurdi and breeders can breed for <i>telfairia</i> seed.(<i><a href="http://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajb/article/viewFile/58583/46924" target="_blank">African Journal of Biotechnology</a></i> Vol. 7, Is. 8, 17/04/2008)</p>

					<p>Sorghum is part of the human diet in India, Africa and parts of Japan. It is used in the United States primarily in animal feed, but it is a major U.S. export and is sold domestically to make gluten-free flour. Sorghum was originally a tropical plant, but U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) scientists are looking to Asia to increase sorghum's cold tolerance and expand its production range. They have found cold-tolerance genes in Chinese cultivars and are using them to develop lines that breeders can use to produce hardy commercial varieties. This research is considered to support the USDA priority of promoting international food security. Extending sorghum's range also would benefit growers overseas. The scientists have released the 171 inbred lines to breeders and research groups through the ARS Germplasm Resources Information Network, and at least two research groups have requested additional information on that population so far. They also published a genetic map of 141 genetic markers in Molecular Breeding that will make it easier for breeders to identify cold tolerance.(<a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2012/121017.htm" target="_blank">USDA ARS</a>, 17/10/2012)</p>

					<p>Scientists at Wageningen University &amp; Research Centre, the Netherlands, have <a href="http://www.wageningenur.nl/en/news-wageningen-ur/Show/Making-barley-less-thirsty.htm" target="_blank">discovered</a> a genetic factor that makes barley plants resistant to salt. Salinity in agricultural lands is a global problem aggravated by climate change. Researchers and plant breeders around the world are looking for opportunities to develop salt-tolerant crops. Nguyen Viet Long, a PhD student, in his research, studied the growth of barley plants in high salt conditions, with the aim of adapting barley to saline environments. He found two sequence regions in the chromosomes of barley that are both less sensitive to high concentrations of salt ions, as well as more resistant to osmotic stress caused by saline soil. Nguyen hopes barley varieties that can be cultivated in saline soils will be commercially available within five years.(Wageningen University &amp; Research Centre via Meridian Institute, 30/10/2012)</p>

					<p>In the frame of <a href="http://www.arcad-project.org/" target="_blank">Arcad</a> (Agropolis Resource Center for Crop Conservation, Adaptation and Diversity) project <i>Cereals in Africa</i>, agrosystem surveys have been conducted on a sample of farms located in three administrative regions of Guinea with a focus on sorghum and fonio landraces. Based on the analysis of the survey, 18 villages were visited on August 2012 and fonio samples of early varieties were collected for further genotyping. Those activities were jointly undertaken by researchers of AGAP and DIADE research units with the Institut de Recherche agronomique de Guinée (IRAG) as the African scientific partner and the major contributor for the organisation of the training and field activities.(<a href="http://www.arcad-project.org/index.php/projets/arcad/general_information/all_news/collection_of_fonio_landraces_in_guinea" target="_blank">Arcad</a>, 12/10/2012)</p>

					<p>The Donald Danforth Plant Science Center’s Institute for International Crop Improvement (IICI), has been established to expand research efforts, trait improvements, product development and biosafety to include a greater range of food security crops. The overall aim of the IICI is to bring improved crops that yield more per acre, are richer in essential nutrients and resistant to disease, insects and drought to small farmers in developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The IICI, directed by Dr. Paul Anderson, will expand and assist partnerships to focus on staple crops, such as sweet potato, banana, cassava, sorghum, maize, rice, groundnuts, millet and cowpea that are typically not the focus of commercial entities but are extremely important to the livelihood of subsistence farmers.The problem now is that this will take subcontracted crop research to outside the developing countries and their research facilities. Can national labs in the ACP regions compete with these ultra high tech research labs for private contracts? For this new centre to be relevant to ACP agrorealities, it will have to gather and acquire knowledge of local conditions and practices (if deemed necessary by research directors) and that may exacerbate brain drain.(<a href="http://www.danforthcenter.org/wordpress/?p=11088" target="_blank">Danforth Center</a>, 22/10/2012)</p>

					<p>The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) has released a report providing guidance for policy and procedures related to accessing and capturing information for national species checklists. Noting that such checklists are invaluable resources for research and biodiversity-related activities, the report says they should be integrated, coordinated and disseminated from a single platform and compiled by expert taxonomists, but this is not always the case. The report titled ‘Best Practice Guide for Compiling, Maintaining and Disseminating National Species Checklists’ was produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) through funding from GBIF.(via <a href="http://biodiversity-l.iisd.org/news/gbif-publishes-new-guide-for-creating-national-species-checklists/" target="_blank">IISD Reporting Services</a>, 10/2012)</p>

					<p>Sauti ya Mkulima, Swahili for voice of the farmer, will deliver agricultural information to farmers through their mobile phones. Approximately 250,000 small-holder farmers in Kenya will receive up-to-date, reliable agricultural information to help them increase the productivity of their yields and improve their incomes. In addition to delivering key information the project will also help create a farmer community to share experiences and exchange information about social gatherings, events, and job opportunities. Initially, Sauti ya Mkulima will focus on small-holder Kenyan farmers engaged in maize, banana, mango, rice, beans and horticulture (tomato and black night shade) crops. Information on more crops will be added on a quarterly basis.(<a href="http://goo.gl/tJkl4" target="_blank">CABI ezine</a>, 10/2012)</p>

					<p>How agricultural research is funded, organised, controlled and practised can have a huge impact on small-scale producers in the global South. In many countries, such research is driven by external funds, priorities and technological fixes, such as hybrid seeds, which can erode crop diversity. But food producers across the world are beginning to raise their voices to ensure that agricultural research better meets their needs and priorities. <a href="http://pubs.iied.org/17122IIED.html" target="_blank">This briefing</a> authored by Michel Pimbert, Research Director at the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), explains how a series of farmer assessments and citizens’ juries in West Africa has helped farmers assess existing approaches and articulate recommendations for policy and practice to achieve their own vision of agricultural research.(IIED, 01/2012)</p>
