						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Africa should not be seen as a charity case in global negotiations on climate change, the continent's newly chosen spokesman on climate change said yesterday (3 September). Speaking at a meeting convened by the UN Economic Commission for Africa in Addis Ababa to promote the African negotiating position, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said the continent has &quot;no intention to free-ride&quot; a post-Kyoto agreement. Zenawi was chosen to chair a new high-level committee to steer the African negotiation process by heads of state meeting in Libya last week (31 August). It is the first time that Africa has spoken with one voice at international climate negotiations. Although the continent needs financial help from developed countries to adapt to the effects of climate change and limit its own contributions to the phenomenon, it does not come to the negotiating table empty-handed, Zenawi said. He pointed out Africa's potential as a market for clean development technologies and the creation of a potential carbon sink. (Source: Scidev.net, 4 September 2009)</p>

					<p>CGIAR’s Generation Challenge Program (GCP) has recently launched a five-year, multi-partner project to deploy a web-based Molecular Breeding Platform (MBP) which will be a one-stop-shop for information, analytical tools and related services to design and efficiently conduct molecular-assisted breeding experiments. The MBP aims to pull together existing, disparate molecular breeding efforts and provide tools and technical support to enhance plant breeding efficiency in the developing world and beyond. MBP has a budget of USD 21 million, resulting from multilateral funding from various donors, though largely supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Molecular breeding, which employs molecular markers to select plants with desirable traits, has been widely used by the private sector to increase the efficiency of the breeding process. Scientists from the public sector, particularly in developing countries, however have had limited access to this technology. The new platform aims to bridge this gap.

					<p>Data from the FAO show that there was an 18 percent increase in rice production in 2008 in Africa, compared to 2007 production levels. The African Rice Center (WARDA) says that increase was brought about by its member countries' adoption of key policy measures which were recommended by the Center in 2007. This contributed to an 18 percent increase in rice production in 2008 in Africa, compared to 2007 production levels, data from the Food and Agriculture organization show. Most notable is a 241 percent increase in Burkina Faso’s rice production in 2008 compared to 2007 levels. Burkina Faso was one of the countries rocked by food riots, following the shock increase in food prices in 2007. FAO attributes this turnaround in Burkina Faso’s rice fortunes to government support to farmers that ensured access to high quality certified rice seed, including NERICA® rice varieties developed by WARDA, and other basic farm inputs.

					<p>The Maldives government has launched the project together with a UK-based company, Carbon Gold. The pilot project aims to produce biochar using bio-waste, including coconut shells, which are abundantly available in the archipelago. Biochar is produced through the “slow cooking” (pyrolysis) of plant wastes. The resulting black char is rich in carbon and can be mixed with soil as a fertiliser. President Mohamed Nasheed, who earlier announced a target of going carbon neutral by 2020, has welcomed the new partnership. ‘Biochar has a crucial role in helping us achieve carbon neutral status as well as providing an economic and environmental boost to our people,’ he said.

					<p>The Agricultural Society of Trinidad and Tobago (ASTT) has launched a project in Cedros to rear tilapia. It is being done in collaboration with Point Coco Agricultural Corporation in an effort towards developing aquacultural projects to ensure a food-stable nation. The project was started in April of this year, when the members of ASTT began to rear the Silver Nile tilapia in raised concrete tanks. Executive board member of the ASTT Jensen Alexander said the ASTT had assembled packages for farmers to encourage tilapia farming and that funding would be provided for interested parties to jump-start the production of a local food source. President of ASTT Dhano Sookoo said the tilapia project is one of the many projects that the ASTT had developed for the expansion of local agriculture.

					<p>An international group of scientists looking at studies of critical thresholds in different complex systems such as humans, ecosystems and financial markets has concluded that regardless of the details, the dynamics of each system near its 'tipping point' share generic properties. Their review of early-warning signal modelling, published in the journal Nature, opens up new opportunities for connecting work on tipping-point phenomena across several disciplines. Predicting when a system will make a critical shift, triggering an asthma attack or a market crash for example, is tricky. Accurate models to predict thresholds in most complex systems are incipient, as in most cases scientists do not have a full understanding of all the relevant mechanisms and feedbacks. The work was funded in part by a European Young Investigator Award, a scheme run through the Sixth Framework Programme to attract outstanding young scientists in all research domains from any country in the world to create their own research teams at European research centres.

	The first 'node' of a Pan-African University (PAU) — a continental network of institutions training postgraduate students and promoting research — could open its doors as early as February next year, an AU official has confirmed. The node at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa would be the first of five hosted by existing institutions across the continent, The PAU aims to improve research excellence and to produce more and better graduates on the continent. It is supported by African education ministers but requires ratification by the Conference of Ministers of Education of the African Union (COMEDAF), which will meet in October in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The South African campus will focus on space science, to tie in with the region's bid to host the Square Kilometre Array of radio telescopes — an honour for which it is competing with Australia. A second campus is scheduled to open in September 2010 in North Africa. It will most likely be located in Algeria and will research water and energy issues. The remaining three campuses will focus on life and earth sciences, basic science (such as physics and chemistry) and engineering, and governance and social sciences. The campuses will be divided between East, Central and West Africa and are not expected to open until 2011. (Source: Scidev.net, 2 September 2009)</p>

A little-known EU regulation coming into force in January next year could have a major impact on the health of fishing industries in developing countries. The EU is the single largest consumer of fish in the world, accounting for around 40 per cent of global imports. Such is the continent’s appetite for aquatic life; the cumulative net fish exports from developing countries now exceed earnings from coffee, bananas and rubber.But near-unfettered access to the European market for developing countries is set to end with the adoption of new legislation to help eradicate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing practices and ensure the sustainability of worldwide fish stocks.

					<p>Mauritius' Minister of Foreign Affairs says his government has secured a large area of land in Mozambique to produce rice for his country. Speaking at a brainstorming session on August 13, Arvin Boolell says his Ministry ‘used all its diplomatic weight to acquire prime land’ for rice production covering 20,000 ha. Most of the land is in the district of Marracuene in the southern province of Maputo where conflicts over land are already intense. The land acquisition in Mozambique is part of a joint venture &quot;mega project&quot; that Mauritius launched around a year ago, after being approached by the Singaporean company Vitagrain. Vitagrain is controlled by the private equity firm Intrasia Captial, a major player in the mining, real estate and energy sectors of the Indian Ocean region. The company intends to develop specialty varieties of hybrid rice that it can sell on the global market. (Source: GRAIN.org, 1 September 2009)</p>

					<p>Research into an initiative to improve the lot of Ghanaian farmers shows how important it is that farmers organise themselves to improve their bargaining power with buyers. The initiative comes from the local Guinness Ghana Brewery Ltd’s decision to substitute malt with locally produced sorghum.

					<p>Scientists led by a former co-chair of the IPCC warn that the UN negotiations aimed at tackling climate change are based on substantial underestimates of what it will cost to adapt to its impacts. The real costs of adaptation are likely to be 2-3 times greater than estimates made by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), say Professor Martin Parry in a new report published by the International Institute for Environment and Development and the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London. The report adds that costs will be even more when the full range of climate impacts on human activities is considered. Parry warns that this underestimate of the cost of adaptation threatens to weaken the outcome of UNFCCC negotiations, which are due to culminate in Copenhagen in December with a global deal aimed at tackling climate change.

					<p>African ministers agreed this week to recommend that the African Union should demand US$67 billion per year from the global community in compensation for the effects of climate change. The annual sum would be spent on establishing science-guided projects to help with adaptation and mitigation. The figure was agreed at a meeting of the Conference of Africa Heads of States and Government on Climate Change in Addis Ababa. However, only deputy ministers attended the meeting, and it is hoped that the declaration will be endorsed by African heads of state mid-September in Tripoli, Libya.

Crops are being damaged from Angola through to Uganda - including many areas where bananas are a staple food. Experts are urging farmers to use pesticides or change to a resistant variety of banana where possible. Scientists have been meeting in Tanzania to decide how to tackle the diseases, which are spread by insects. In a statement CGIAR said ‘drastic and expensive control measures’ were needed. These include ‘completely excavating entire banana fields and treating them with pesticides, or burning the plants’.

					<p>Africa is central to the worldwide growth in biofuels, with Dutch, American, Swedish, Japanese, German, and British firms all competing for farmland to grow the next generation of energy producing crops. Ghana has made itself a focal point of biofuel growth in Africa. As host of this year's World Jatropha Summit, the government in Accra is seeking greater investment in the hardy plant whose seeds can be crushed into oil that is processed into high-quality biodiesel. In Ghana, seven private companies are currently farming about 50,000 hectares of land for biofuels. The non-governmental organization Food Security Policy Advocacy Network studied the impact of multinational jatropha production in the Volta, Eastern, Central, and Ashanti regions. The survey, conducted with ActionAid Ghana, revealed that there were serious threats to livelihood and food security. With hundreds of farmers not planting traditional food crops this season, there is a real risk that the shift to biofuels will result in food shortages. (Source: VOA news, 23 August 2009)</p>

					<p>Key tools to help countries adapt to climate change will be developed at the World Climate Conference-3 (WCC-3), which will take place in Geneva from 31 August to 4 September 2009. The meeting will bring together high-level decision-makers, scientists, policy-makers, and business leaders to initiate a Global Framework for Climate Services to boost climate adaptation. The Framework will be especially relevant to Africa, a region that is already highly vulnerable to climate change due to water scarcity, strong dependence on agricultural production and high population concentration along the coastal regions.</p>
