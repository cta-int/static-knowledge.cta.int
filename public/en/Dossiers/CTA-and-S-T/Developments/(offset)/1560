						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Knowledge sharing is the exchange of ideas and experiences through networks of relationships. Climate change has become a major threat to the African continent with many local communities already affected and struggling to adapt or cope with its impacts. In order to increase the resilience of these vulnerable communities, there is a need to ensure they have access to information on appropriate adaptive practices. However knowledge sharing is relatively limited among climate change actors in Africa. The diversity of stakeholders involved in adaptation processes (from policymakers to CSOs, researchers and, most importantly, local communities) and the barriers imposed by poverty, limited infrastructure, and illiteracy, among others, make knowledge exchange a challenge. Thus, knowledge sharing requires the use of approaches that are tailored to the needs and constraints faced by particular stakeholders. Local communities, for example, may require non-text-based communications such as video or theatre, face-to-face discussions, or local-language radio broadcasts. Similarly, local and indigenous knowledge must be translated into different languages and forms if it is to be appropriately communicated to research and policy communities. <i>The full text with conclusions and recommendations is available at the link.</i> (Source: IISD, 23 July 2009)</p>

					<p>A killer disease is decimating fish stocks in the Zambezi River Valley, threatening the food security and livelihoods of rural populations in an area shared by seven countries, FAO warned on July 21 2009. An alert issued by FAO’s Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS) said the disease, known as Epizootic Ulcerative Syndrome, or EUS, is caused by the fungus Aphanomyces invadans, which forms ugly lesions on fish and has a high rate of mortality. It is one of the most serious aquatic diseases affecting finfish. “If not properly contained there is the risk of the disease spreading to other countries surrounding the Zambezi River as well as river systems in the region,” said Rohana Subasinghe, Senior Fishery Resources Officer. The 1,390,000 km² Zambezi River Basin is home to some 32 million people, of whom 80 percent are dependent on agriculture or fishing and fish farming. (Source: FAO, 21 July 2009)</p>

	The use of remote sensing and satellite imaging looks set to become more widespread in South Africa as sustainable agriculture and natural resource management become more urgent in the face of climate change. Remote sensing, a technique that uses recorded or real-time wireless sensing devices to collect information on an object or phenomenon, is proving more successful in South Africa than other African countries for two reasons: South Africa has the required telecommunications network infrastructure to support remote sensing, and its higher internet capacity means that information can be transmitted consistently and in a timely manner. &quot;For the past decade we have used remote sensing to evaluate and monitor land use, and its impact on the land. We also use remote sensing for mapping land cover and ecosystems, and for monitoring drought outlooks,&quot; a specialist researcher for the Limpopo Department of Agriculture, Brilliant Mareme Petja, told IRIN. Scientists at the Department of Agriculture in Limpopo Province have begun using remote sensing techniques to monitor the impact of climate change, with a view to mitigating and adapting to altered conditions. &quot;Remote sensor data combined with meteorological data from the rainfall stations enables us to demarcate areas that are more likely to be affected by climate change,&quot; Petja said.

The <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/" target="_blank">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</a>, the UN body of scientists drawn from around the world, will use its next assessment due in 2014 to look at how the impact of global warming is falling unequally on the poorest developing countries. Two hundred key members of the IPCC met in Venice from 13 – 17 July 2009 to begin scoping out its fifth assessment. Rajendra Pachauri, the body's chairman, told reporters that the panel was determined to increase its understanding of local and regional impacts of rising temperatures. There was an awareness, he said, that in Africa in particular there was insufficient scientific and modelling fire-power to be able to predict in any detail what was likely to happen under global warming. &quot;It's critically important that we create the capacity in Africa to be able to assess the impact of climate change.&quot; Pachauri said the fifth assessment, the first draft of which is scheduled for 2013, would concentrate both on adaptations and mitigations that countries could make as rising temperatures take hold. &quot;Every nation and community in the world will have to adapt [to] whatever happens in Copenhagen.&quot; (Source: Guardian.co.uk, 20 July 2009) </p>

	The tiny Pacific island state of Tuvalu has said it wants all its energy to come from renewable sources by 2020. Tuvalu is made up of a string of atolls with the highest point only 4.5m (15 ft) above sea level, making it extremely vulnerable to flooding. The government hopes to use wind and solar power to generate electricity, instead of imported diesel. Tuvalu and many other low-lying atolls in the Pacific, the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean fear that global warning could lead to sea level rises that could literally wipe them off the map. Most of these countries have relatively small populations, and their pledges are unlikely to make a significant difference in the overall battle against global warming. But many environmentalists say their stance is nevertheless important, as they provide a lead for other countries to follow. &quot;In a sense, they are paving the way for medium and larger economies which have to move if we are going to combat climate change,&quot; Nick Nuttall, spokesman for the United Nations Environment Programme, told the French news agency AFP.

					<p>It has been assumed that global warming would cause an expansion of the world's deserts, but now some scientists are predicting a contrary scenario in which water and life slowly reclaim these arid places. They think vast, dry regions like the Sahara might soon begin shrinking. The evidence is limited and definitive conclusions are impossible to reach but recent satellite pictures of North Africa seem to show areas of the Sahara in retreat. It could be that an increase in rainfall has caused this effect. Farouk el-Baz, director of the Centre for Remote Sensing at Boston University, believes the Sahara is experiencing a shift from dryer to wetter conditions. &quot;It's not greening yet. But the desert expands and shrinks in relation to the amount of energy that is received by the Earth from the Sun, and this over many thousands of years,&quot; Mr el-Baz said. Remote sensing - radar-imaging from space - began in 1981 and showed scientists what was going on under the Saharan sand. The aquifer, a collection of reservoirs trapped underground between layers of permeable rock, was studied and mapped for the first time. Tapping into this supply has meant deserts areas can, with skill and judgement, be transformed into farmable land. (Source: BBC World Service, 16 July 2009)</p>

					<p>Water is precious in Eritrea, where farmers have to cope with droughts and crop failures. With support from the government and an IFAD-funded project, farmers and herders are expanding spate irrigation, an ancient form of water management. By harnessing floodwaters and collecting run-off, farmers can provide enough water for the crop season. Now some farmers can obtain yields that are six times what they used to be. Spate irrigation is one of the most viable ways of supporting the livelihoods of economically marginalized farmers. It is different from conventional perennial irrigation and it is used in areas prone to unpredictable and destructive floods, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas. &quot;Farmers can start planting their crops only after irrigation has taken place,&quot; explains Efrem Tekle, crop specialist in the Ministry of Agriculture. &quot;Since the timing, volume and number of floods are highly unpredictable, this type of agriculture is prone to risk. Farmers need to cooperate closely with one another to manage the distribution of flood flows and also to manage and maintain the spate irrigation system.&quot; (Source: IFAD)</p>

					<p>Mobile phones are the unlikely weapons being used to fight cassava disease in Tanzania, in a collaboration between scientists and farmers. As part of the Digital Early Warning Network (DEWN), farmers from ten districts in the Lake Zone region of Tanzania will be trained to recognise the symptoms of Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) and Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD). They will then send monthly text messages to the researchers about disease incidence — and receive disease control advice in return. The first part of DEWN, which started in June 2009, is the establishment of the farmer network by visiting the groups to train them in recognising cassava disease and communicating with researchers at the Lake Zone Agricultural Research and Development Institute (LZARD). Innocent Ndyetabura, a plant researcher at LZARD, says that the project will not only build farmers' knowledge of cassava diseases but also enable researchers to forecast disease prevalence in threatened areas.

					<p>CARICOM leaders issued the Liliendaal Declaration on Climate Change on July 4 2009 which recalled the objective, principles and commitments of the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Kyoto Protocol and grave concern that the Caribbean region’s efforts to promote sustainable development and to achieve the internationally agreed development goals including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are under severe threat from the devastating effects of climate change and sea level rise which has led to increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather events, damage to biodiversity, coral bleaching, coastal erosion, and changing precipitation patterns. The leaders emphasized that dangerous climate change is already occurring in all SIDS (Small Islands and Low-lying Coastal Developing States) regions including the Caribbean and that many SIDS will cease to exist without urgent, ambitious and decisive action by the international community to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions significantly and to support SIDS in their efforts to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change, including through the provision of increased levels of financial and technical resources.

					<p>Ghana’s only oil refinery, the Tema Oil Refinery (TOR) intends to go into the production of biofuels in the next 18 months, in anticipation of the phasing out of conventional oil, its acting Managing Director has said. Dr Kwame Ampofo then stressed on the importance for African refiners to shift their focus from conventional fuels to biofuels so that they will be in a better position to satisfy the international market. Currently, in Ghana over twenty companies say they are investing in biofuels, some are into the cultivation of Jatropha. (Source: CheckBiotech, 6 July 2009)</p>

					<p>Scientists working at the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) announced recently the release of a new Soybean variety that is resistant to the Asian soybean rust - a fungal disease that could wipe out as much as 80% of infested crops. The rust-resistant soybean is the first of its kind to be made available for cultivation not only in Nigeria but also in West and Central Africa and has the potential of increasing soybean production in rust-prone areas of the region. Tagged TGx 1835-10E, the variety was bred by scientists at IITA and further developed in collaboration with the National Cereal Research Institute (NCRI). &quot;It has resistance genes that are effective against all currently known types of the rust fungus in Nigeria. IITA has bred several other varieties with rust resistance genes from various sources which can be deployed quickly if this variety succumbs to newer forms of the rust fungus&quot;, adds IITA pathologist Ranajit Bandyopadhyay.

					<p>An appeal board recently overturned opposition from the South African GMO Executive Council to allow testing of a nutritionally enhanced, genetically modified sorghum, known as 'Super Sorghum' in greenhouses in Pretoria. The application by the Council for Scientific Industrial Research (CSIR) - and endorsed by South Africa's Minister of Land Affairs and Agriculture - was successful at the second attempt when the applicant supplied additional information that it would meet biosafety requirements for the laboratory trials. The battle between supporters and critics of genetically modified (GM) crops that promise higher yields, better resistance to pests or adaptability to a changing climate is expected to increase in intensity should this trial move from the greenhouse to the fields.

					<p>The University of Cape Verde has joined the African Virtual Campus for Science and Technology. This latest addition brings the number of participating countries to four: Benin, Cape Verde, Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal. As well as participating in the international network, Cape Verde is planning to create its own national network by linking up 10 centres across the archipelago. The <a href="http://www.unesco.org/science/psd/thm_innov/avc.shtml" target="_self">African Virtual Campus</a> was launched in July 2008 when Benin became the first host country for the network. It is one of three UNESCO flagship projects contributing to implementation of <a href="http://www.nepadst.org/doclibrary/pdfs/ast_cpa_2007.pdf" target="_self">Africa’s Science and Technology Consolidated Plan of Action</a>. The other two are Capacity building in Science, Technology and Innovation Policy and Enhancing Science and Technology Education.
