						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>
Recruitment of students has begun in various African Universities under a new initiative known as Regional Initiative in Science and Education (RISE). Fifty-one students have been admitted in universities in five networks. Of the recruited students, thirty-five will pursue their doctorate degrees, fifteen will pursue their masters degrees while one will be a post-doctoral fellow. The major goal of RISE is to strengthen higher education in sub-Saharan Africa by increasing the population of qualified faculty members in Africa's universities.

					<p>A pilot project that uses mobile phones to alert farmers in remote regions to where they can buy drought-tolerant beans has been launched in Kenya - just one of a set of pilot projects using mobile and geospatial technologies to improve communication of important information to farmers across Africa. In the first step of the system researchers confirm where dealers are stocking drought-tolerant beans, mapping their locations. Scientists then use mobile phone services to send the information to government extension workers who have second-generation mobile phones, common in Africa. They can then relay the information to farmers in person or via their phones. &quot;We will produce maps which can be used by extension officers or community development workers so that this information can be passed onto farmers who wish to acquire improved drought-tolerant bean seeds,&quot; says Andrew Farrow, a spatial analyst at Uganda's Kawanda Agricultural Research Institute.

					<p>A lot of efforts have been put in by the various leaders and the founding fathers of Ghana to improve on science and technology in the country. There is the common understanding that in order for the country to develop and be self sufficient it has to reduce its reliance on the importation of science and technology from the developed nations. But despite their achievements, the prospect of the development of science and technology in Ghana is now dwindling and a lot needs to be done to resuscitate these very important fields of study. Currently graduates in the field complain of lack of opportunities for further development after graduation. This article provides an overview of the Ghanaian science and technology landscape and brings the current challenges under attention. (Source: Ghanaweb, 24 April 2009)</p>

					<p>Some of the developing world's largest rivers are drying up because of climate change, threatening water supplies in some of the most populous places on Earth, say scientists. Researchers from the US-based National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) analysed data combined with computer models to assess flow in 925 rivers - nearly three quarters of the world's running water supply - between 1948 and 2004. A third of these had registered a change in flow and most of them - including the Niger in West Africa, the Ganges in South Asia and the Yellow River in China - were dryer. Rivers are losing water for a variety of reasons, say the researchers, including the installation of dams and the use of water for agriculture. But in many cases the decrease in flow is because of climate change, which is altering rainfall patterns and increasing evaporation because of higher temperatures.

					<p>A team of environmental experts in conjunction with members of the civil society from the East and Central African region have developed evidence based strategies that will help the region form resilience against climate change, and develop opportunities out of it. In a workshop which was held in Mombasa, the experts were categorical that climate change comes with either a ‘package’ of advantages, or one of disadvantages, and that it is important for countries to explore the advantages and make opportunities out of them. The workshop had a purpose of identifying strategies that can work between government, international support agencies and non-governmental organisations in order to enhance resilience, by strengthening public institutions, civil society and community based organisations.

					<p>Cuba, with the support of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, known in Latin America with the acronym COSUDE, is investing in a research program named &quot;Bio-Mass as a Renewable Source of Energy for the countryside&quot;. Bio-mass is the main renewable energy source in Cuba. The main goal of the project is to boost the production of biogas, a fuel obtained from the decomposition of organic matter when there is lack of oxygen in the air. José Sotolongo MSc, founder of the Application of Technologies for a Sustainable Development Center, said that they plan to obtain this bio fuel by processing the waste from coffee beans, rice and forestry residues. Besides this center, the partners of the project include the Indio Hatuey Experimental Station, from Matanzas University, the Sugar Cane Research Institute, and the Science and Technology's Agency's Priority Projects Group that belongs to the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment.

Through BTSF-Africa, over the next two years, €10million will be used to fund capacity building activities. The key objective is to support food safety mainly by the transfer of technical expertise and policy advice in areas of food safety and quality across Africa. The knowledge, expertise and skills transferred will help to produce and distribute agro-food products compatible with international SPS standards, contributing towards the reduction of the likelihood of food-borne diseases and the related health and socio-economic burden.

	Plans are at an advanced stage for the establishment of a Global Climate Change Adaptation Network for Africa to spearhead mitigation of effects of climate change in the continent. The network is set to enhance climate change adaptation capacity of developing countries by mobilising appropriate knowledge and technologies to help build the climate change resilience of vulnerable human systems.The regional consultative forum on the topic, recently held at Nairobi, mandated the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) to set up an interim steering committee to work on the development of an implementation plan of the network.

					<p>Adjacent countries often face common problems that could benefit from joint solutions, so closer integration between five East African countries should be great news for local researchers. But political tensions seem to be hampering efforts to harmonise science policies in the region. The problem is unlikely to be specific to science, which is rarely a politically sensitive area. More likely, it is related to mounting political tensions dogging wider integration plans for an East African Federation by the middle of the next decade. Whatever the solution, unless science integration moves forward in East Africa, the whole region will lose out. (Source: Linda Nordling, SciDev.net, 2 April 2009)</p>

					<p>A report published by the UNESCO hosted World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP) has warned that the sharp increase in biofuel production has significant impact on water demand. According to the <a href="http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/wwdr/wwdr3/pdf/WWDR3_Water_in_a_Changing_World.pdf" target="_blank">United Nations World Water Development Report 3</a> , presented ahead of the Fifth World Water Forum in Istanbul, production of ethanol stood at 77 billion litres in 2008 and should reach 127 billion litres by 2017. One of the major problems with biofuels is the need for large quantities of water and fertilizers to grow the crops. Between 1 000 and 4 000 litres of water are needed to produce a single litre of biofuel. The report says that, despite their potential to help reduce dependence on fossil energy, biofuels, with current technology, are likely to place a disproportionate amount of pressure on biodiversity and the environment.

					<p>A project is underway in Niger to increase cowpea production by improving farming techniques. The effort is called the Gatsby Crop-Livestock Project, named after the London-based organization that is providing funding for the effort. Dr. Hakeem Ajeigbe says the IITA livestock project includes improved farming methods,&quot;We have brought a new system, the strip cropping system, whereby the farmers can plant either one or two rows of cereals for four rows of cowpea. This creates a window for cowpea because with these four rows shading is minimized.&quot; (Source: VAO, Isiyaku Ahmed, 31 March 2009)</p>

	Local scientists must scale up their research activities to bolster national food security and help solve climate change and energy problems affecting resource-strapped farmers in rural areas, Science and Technology Development Minister Professor Heneri Dzinotyiweyi said on March 30. RAEIN-Africa launched three programmes with a budget of close to US$5 million that would finance project proposals from local research institutions that focus on science and technology and agriculture with a view of developing agricultural and environmental technologies that respond to the needs of marginalised farmers in the country.
