						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>With biofuel production on the rise, researchers are looking for ways to grow plants for use as energy sources without taking over fertile land currently used for food crops. One possible solution is to move biofuel feedstocks onto poor quality soil that is not ideal for agriculture, such as soils that lack nutrients, receive little rain or have been contaminated from previous industrial use. Scientist have found a unique way to increase the growth of one promising biofuel source on marginal land: just add bacteria. If the conversion problems are solved, cellulosic biofuels could not only become crucial energy sources, they could also provide a way to put otherwise unproductive land to good use.

					<p>Environmental experts have started implementing field level micro-projects aimed at improving the livelihood of people living in and around the Ngovayang Forest in the South Regional. The Ngovayang Forest constitutes an important source of livelihood for the local people derived from the use of non-timber-forest products. The management and sustainable harvest of these products necessitate a better understanding of the collection, processing and marketing of the products. The indigenous people of the area are the Bagneli and Bakola living alongside their Bantou neighbours who often claim ownership of all natural resources in the region.

	Biologists at Kansas State University are working with a researcher in Ghana to create biodiesel from the seeds of trees that are common and well adapted to the climate of northern Ghana. Walter Kpikpi from the University for Development Studies, Navrongo Campus, in Ghana visited K-State in November 2008 with funding from K-State's African Studies Center. He is leading a project that will make biodiesel for local farmers in Ghana from seeds collected by local farmers. Proposing that Jatropha curcas and Azadirachta indica seeds are best suited for biofuels, Kpikpi's project envisions cultivating these trees specifically for biodiesel production on land that isn't suitable to grow food.

					<p>Lack of local research is preventing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa producing energy from waste, according to a report. The region has abundant raw materials for producing biogas. Waste and polluted water from industry - including slaughterhouse remnants, animal dung and sewage - can be converted into carbon dioxide and methane through anaerobic digestion. The biogas can be used for cooking and vehicle fuel, and the waste product as a fertiliser. But a recent assessment of efforts to research and apply biogas technology says production plants are not widespread because biogas research is impeded by poor infrastructure, a lack of human resources, and a lack of funding for the purchase and maintenance of essential equipment and running costs. Therefore joint research programmes between African and developed countries are suggested, which should also explore technology transfer. The review was published in the <a href="http://www.academicjournals.org/AJB/PDF/pdf2009/19Jan/Mshandete%20and%20Parawira.pdf" target="_blank">African Journal of Biotechnology </a>in January 2009.

					<p>The battering taken by Caribbean coral reefs is finally taking its toll on the fish that dwell in them, a large new study suggests. &quot;We are seeing striking declines that are amazingly consistent across a huge area and very different types of fish,&quot; says Michelle Paddack of Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada. Paddack's team reanalysed 48 studies that had taken place in 318 reefs since 1955 and found that after decades of stability, fish numbers have started to go down. Starting from the mid 1990s, in all regions covered by the studies, fish numbers have fallen by between 2.7 and 6% per year. Paddack suspects that as well as overfishing, coral demise from disease and bleaching is to blame, together with pollution from coastal development. (Source: New Scientist, 19 March 2009)</p>

					<p>Ghanaian small scale farmers, particularly women, are facing displacement from their farm lands. In recent times, the northern parts of Ghana are said to be witnessing an influx of foreign companies engaged in jatropha and sugar-cane plantation for biofuel production. Some of these companies that are investing in biofuel production acquire large track of land but only pay the farmers for the portion of the land they utilize, in spite of an existing contract. The Global Convention on Food Security requires governments to develop and implement national food security plans and to create an international network of local, national, and regional food reserves. (Source: All Africa, Ama Achiaa Amankwah, 16 March 2009)</p>

					<p>By 2015 the Carteret islands - off the coast of Papua New Guinea - could well be a mirage. The low lying atoll is sinking and sinking fast as the ocean is rising. Salt water has eaten up the shoreline and invaded the gardens. For many, it’s time to pack up and go, but without help from the government, hundreds are stuck on this sinking atoll. Paul Tsube is one of the few who managed to leave early. He didn’t wait for government assistance to migrate. Scientists are still debating why the atoll is sinking. Paul Tsube blames global warming and the developed world for what’s happened to his island. “And I think that something has to be done by the industrialised nations so we can get some sort of assistance from them.” (Source: France24, 15 March 2009)</p>
