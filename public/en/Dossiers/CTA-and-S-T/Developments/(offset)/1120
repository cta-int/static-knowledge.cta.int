						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	At the International Scientific Symposium on Biodiversity and Sustainable Diets organized by the FAO in Rome on 2-5 November 2010, Dr. Mark Nesbitt, ethnobotanist and curator at the Royal Botanic Gardens (Kew, UK) and his colleagues showed results from their analysis of the quality of botanical information in published papers. They found that in many cases, when the botanical names as given in the papers are used, it becomes very difficult to identify the species concerned accurately enough to use automated searches of databases. This could pose problem as researchers seek to build a case for the value of lesser-known wild and cultivated species in building sustainable and nutritious diets. In light of his study, Dr. Nesbitt recommends that ‘best practices’ in naming plants be developed and implemented where needed in academic and research institutions.Nesbitt, M., McBurney, R., Broin, M., &amp; Beentje, H. (2010). <b>Linking biodiversity, food and nutrition: The importance of plant identification and nomenclature, Journal of Food Composition and Analysis</b>, 23 (6), 486-498</p>

	The multi-stakeholder grouping that met in Georgetown, Guyana, to review the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Agricultural Policy (CAP) included specialists in the field of agriculture and trade; representatives of Member States as well as those of regional organisations including Caribbean Agricultural Research Development Institute (CARDI); the University of Guyana; the Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism (CRFM); the Caribbean Food and Nutrition Institute (CFNI); Inter-American Institution for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA); representatives of farmers and agribusiness organisations including the Caribbean Agribusiness Association (CABA) and Caribbean Farmers Network’s (CaFAN), and representatives of international development partners. The Policy was created to assist Member States in agricultural policy formulation, planning, implementation and the monitoring of national policy processes. The two-day Validation Workshop for the Draft CARICOM Community Agricultural Policy (CCAP) and Implementation Plan, is part of a broader strategic plan to transform the agriculture sector into one that is internationally competitive and one which contributes to sustainable economic development of the region.

	A study conducted by the West and Central African Council for Agricultural Research and Development (WECARD) and published early November 2010 in Dakar, Senegal, found that women own less than two per cent of arable lands in West and Central Africa, although they are responsible for about 80 per cent of the agricultural production for the supply of households and markets. The study noted that women constitute about 70 per cent of agricultural workers and are producing 50 to 60 per cent of cattle breeding products. Ten per cent of agro-processors are women and they account for 60 to 90 per cent of trade in the rural areas. The study listed the problems women are confronted with including the burden of customary and traditional practices, the lack of access to credit, their limited participation in agricultural extension services and limited access to commercial facilities and services. The results will be used by WECARD to design the organization’s gender policy and strategy. (Source: Afriquejet, 6 November 2010).</p>

	In September 2010, the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC, Nairobi, Kenya) published its ‘Special Paper’ No.46. It features an article by Abena D. Oduro (from the Department of Economics at the University of Ghana in Legon, Ghana) in which the authors analyze the representation of women in AERC research programmes. This report on women in economic research and graduate training in West Africa summarizes the findings of studies conducted in Ghana and Liberia (Geegbae, 2007; Oduro, 2007). The reports on Ghana and Liberia are intended to provide the AERC with data and the information required to design specific strategies and activities to increase the participation of women. In this report, the population statistics of women and men in undergraduate and graduate economics programmes in Ghana and Liberia are detailed, then used to explain, along with results from female student surveys, a variety of phenomena such as preferred areas of specialization, plans after graduation, barriers to professional growth, and other challenges, like family responsibilities. A series of recommendations is given as conclusion to the report, covering identified needs such as the strengthening of capacity in quantitative methods, the production of more core textbooks by local researchers, and the increase in short and specialized courses.

	On 26 October 2010, the FAO launched the 2nd State of the World’s Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture report (SoWPGR-2). This report provides a comprehensive overview of recent trends in Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (PGRFA) conservation and use around the world. It is based on information gathered from more than 100 countries, as well as from regional and international research and support organizations and academic programmes. The report documents the current status of plant genetic resources diversity, conservation and use, as well as the extent and role of national, regional and international efforts that underpin the contributions of PGRFA to food security. It highlights the most significant changes that have occurred in the sector since 1996, when the first report was produced. The SoWPGR-2 provides the basis for the updating of the Global Plan of Action for the Conservation and Sustainable Utilization of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (GPA).

	The Crop Protection Compendium (CPC) developed by the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux International (CABI, UK). As of August 2010, it is the most comprehensive resource for crop protection information, updated in real time. Key features include over 400 updated and new data sheets, over 50,000 bibliographic records from the most recent literature and around 10,000 full text articles from journals and conferences. In addition, it features links to a vast resource of carefully selected content on the web, access to well-categorized library documents and a powerful new search engine. This encyclopedic, mixed-media tool collates science-based knowledge from experts all over the world. It comprises wide-ranging and detailed information on over 3,500 pests, diseases, weeds, natural enemies, host crops and the countries in which they occur, with basic data on a further 27,000. Compilation of the CPC has involved many years of work with funding assistance provided by international consortium members, including government departments, companies and Non-Governmental Organizations.</p>

	The African Copyright &amp; Access to Knowledge (ACA2K) Project, which started in 2007, is probing the relationship between national copyright environments and access to learning materials in African countries. The project is exploring this relationship within an access to knowledge (A2K) framework - a framework which regards the protection/promotion of user access as one of the central objectives of copyright law. The project, supported by Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC, Ottawa) and South Africa's Shuttleworth Foundation (Durbanville, South Africa) and managed by the LINK Centre at the Wits University Graduate School of Public &amp; Development Management (P&amp;DM) in Johannesburg South Africa, currently has research nodes in eight African countries: Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Mozambique, Senegal, South Africa and Uganda. The general objective of the ACA2K project is to empower researchers in the study countries (nodes) to develop the evidence necessary for stakeholders in their countries to pursue development of copyright policy environments that maximise the opportunities for digital and hard-copy learning materials access.</p>

	Dr. Dennis Garrity, Director General of the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), speaking at The Hague Conference on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change on 2 November 2010, said evergreen agriculture—or the integration of fertilizer trees into crop and livestock-holding farms—is rapidly emerging as an affordable and accessible solution to improving production on Africa's farms. In a recent article in the Journal Food Security (Vol.2, Num. 3), Garrity and co-authors highlighted how evergreen agriculture has already provided benefits to several million farmers in Zambia, Malawi, Niger and Burkina Faso. Fertilizer trees draw nitrogen from the air and transfer it to the soil through their roots and leaf litter, replenishing exhausted soils with rich sources of organic nutrients. The trees bolster nutrient supply, increase food crop yields, and enhance the production of fodder, fuel and timber. These systems also provide additional income to farmers from tree products, while at the same time storing much greater amounts of carbon than other agricultural systems.

COPE’s services include a range of training programmes in phytosanitary policy and practice, and a unit for applied pest risk analysis (PRA). The training will range from short in-service modules to full degree programmes and will make full use of the Centre’s plant inspection facility and information management system. The PRA unit will conduct pest risk analyses according to relevant international standards while supporting a network of African pest risk analysts. The development of COPE was funded by the Standards and Trade Development Facility of the World Trade Organization (STDF-WTO), the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC), the Netherlands Plant Protection Service (NPPS-Netherlands), the Inter African Phytosanitary Council of the African Union and national plant health service providers in the East and Southern Africa. The launch of the Centre of phytosanitary excellence (COPE) took place simultaneously in Nairobi (Kenya), Lusaka (Zambia) and Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) on 27 October 2010.

The International Development Research Centre (IDRC), based in Ottawa, Canada, will assist its Climate Change Adaptation in Africa (CCAA) program partners in three countries in East Africa build the capacity of researchers to influence policy. The poor understanding of policy processes tends to reduce the value of research results and the ability of researchers to influence policy. The researchers in this project investigate the complexity of adaptation policy processes in different countries and identify policy spaces; use this knowledge to build policy engagement tools and strategy; develop an analytical framework for investigating climate change adaptation policy processes in Africa; and mentor relationships between participatory action researchers and academic partners.

	Produced by African Smallholder Farmers Group with the assistance of Practical Action and other NGOs, 'Africa’s Smallholder Farmers: Approaches that work for viable livelihoods' emphasises the need to support and prioritise smallholder farmers in Africa, and to provide the right kind of support that enables them to strengthen agriculture and livelihoods over the long term (instead of focus on short-term productivity gains). It contains nine case studies of successful approaches, including three from Practical Action's African offices. The African Smallholder Farmers Group is a consortium of agencies whose aim is to promote effective support to smallholder farmers in Africa by sharing lessons and information, collecting evidence of what works and highlighting the important of smallholder farmers to developing country and donor governments. <a href="http://practicalaction.org/reducing-vulnerability/docs/ia1/asfg-africa-smallholder-farmers.pdf%20" target="_blank">View PDF</a> (Source: Zunia, 23 August 2010)</p>

This led to an agreement between JRC-IES and CISR in July 2008 to facilitate the interaction and exchange of staff, knowledge, data and software. NASA became involved in the collaboration in 2009, which culminated in a shipment of most of the data this summer. The data are from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), managed by NASA. This transfer of data to a distribution centre in Africa will make it widely accessible to African users who have not been able to remotely download the large data files because of limitations in the continent's internet infrastructure.

					<p>The August 2010 issue of NANO Magazine, highlighting nanoscale research expected to have a positive impact on the developing world, such as research focusing on energy generation, disease prevention and water purification. In one of the articles, Kathy Jo Wetter writes that despite supposedly self-evident claims to its ability to solve social and health problems in Africa, developments in nanotechnology should be met with serious critical reflection. In a discussion of what nanotechnology is and the risks associated with it, Wetter underlines that the technology offers new opportunities of monopoly control ‘over both animate and inanimate matter’, while government regulations worldwide remain completely inadequate to address its unique risks.

	A recent analysis of the link between intellectual property rights, technology transfer and development, conducted by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) shows that in order to foster development through technology, it is necessary to put into place an efficient and flexible intellectual property rights system and to promote local innovation. This study draws on research and on answers to a questionnaire sent to regional universities and research and development centres. (Source: IP-Watch, August 2010)</p>

	The Humanitarian Policy Group of the Overseas Development Institute, London, UK, argues in their study of September 2010 ‘Working across borders’ that there remains limited understanding of the nature, magnitude and value of cross-border livelihood activities in the Horn of Africa. The key messages are 


Mobile pastoralist systems often cross international borders. There is a need for more research, policy and practice efforts to better understand and exploit the potential of cross-border activities to enhance drought management, contribute to national economies, and improve local livelihoods and food security in the Horn of Africa.

Governments in the region should cooperate in granting legal and economic legitimacy to informal cross-border trade exchanges and step up collective efforts to control trans-boundary animal diseases.

Regional bodies can play a pivotal coordination role and provide the enabling policy environment and legal framework to regulate cross-border dynamics. Donors should support these processes.


There is also a need to recognize that a timely, adequate and comprehensive response to drought must also focus on border areas and support cross-border activities. (Source: Reliefweb, September 2010)</p>

Africa’s Rural Futures (RF) programme, an initiative of NEPAD and the WWF, sets out plans to boost rural development, and is an attempt to adapt to the impact of climate change.At the same time, organizations such as the UNEP and the World Bank are backing the UN’s Green Economy Initiative, which is more focused on mitigation. In his address at the seventh African Development Forum in Addis Ababa, Ibrahim Assane Mayaki, NEPAD’s chief executive officer, called RF a ‘new way of thinking about development’.

	Until recently, the coffee berry borer, a beetle that devastates coffee plants, was confined to just a few regions in Central Africa. But since the 1980s, the beetle has gradually spread to every coffee-growing region except Hawaii, Nepal, and Papua New Guinea. Juliana Jaramillo, a biologist at ICIPE, Nairobi, Kenya, suspects temperature increases are to blame. She and her collaborators recently identified the temperature range in which the beetle can survive. They found that the average minimum temperature the borer requires to reproduce is about 68 degrees F. In their research, Jaramillo and her collaborators found that for every 1.8 degrees F increase in temperature, the coffee berry borer became 8.5 per cent more infectious on average. A follow up study, published this year in the Journal of Economic Entomology, found that higher temperatures also caused the female beetles to travel from berry to berry earlier. Coffee farmers need new strategies to combat threats such as the coffee berry borer. (Source: The Guardian, 27 August 2010)</p>
