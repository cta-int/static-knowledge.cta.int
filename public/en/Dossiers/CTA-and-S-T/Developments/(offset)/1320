						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Researchers at the French National Agricultural Research Institute (INRA) have developed a biological method to control pathogenic strains of <i>Fusarium oxysporum,</i> a common fungus found in soils throughout the world. Some of its numerous strains are pathogenic, while others are non-pathogenic and can protect plants against infection by a pathogenic strain. This protection phenomenon has been known for many years, and scientists have now isolated a strain called Fo47 which provides particularly efficient protection. The researchers found that Fo47 was capable of developing in different types of soil, and its introduction had very little impact on the microbiological equilibrium of the soil measured after one year.

	The Pacific regional countries, including Fiji, are facing a serious threat from alien invasive species, according to a new publication coordinated by the Global Invasive Species Program (GISP). The publication, released on February 19, listed a number of alien species as a major threat to life on earth, ‘and unfortunately a number of these now exist in the South Pacific islands’, said Don Stewart, Regional Director of BirdLife International in the Pacific. Invasive alien species are plants and animals not native to the South Pacific countries but have been introduced either through trade, or through ‘misguided’ attempts to protect local flora and fauna.

					<p>Four university lecturers in agriculture have expressed concern over the decline in the number of students studying agriculture in Ghana’s universities, saying the situation could have dire consequences for the country’s food security. They have, therefore, urged stakeholders, namely, the West African Examinations Council (WAEC), the junior and senior high schools, the universities and the government, to come up with policies and programmes that will put to rest all misconceptions about that area of training and encourage students to study agriculture.

					<p>Recent studies of East Coast fever have shown that the so-called ‘protective’ proteins of the causative parasite—that is, the antigenic molecules that are recognized by the T lymphocytes of the bovine immune system and thus help animals fight development of disease—vary among the different strains of the parasite that exist in the field. This project will build on these advances to investigate the nature and extent of variability in these antigens between parasite strains. This knowledge will help scientists understand the factors that determine which parasite strains induce protective immune responses in animals that have been vaccinated. Results of the project should provide methods for maintaining high quality of the current live vaccine and identifying parasite strains that could be incorporated into an improved second-generation live vaccine.

Not many are aware of its importance as raw material in the textile, food, pharmaceutical, packaging, and cosmetics industries. In countries of sub-Saharan Africa where cassava is commonly grown, its alternative uses could spur economic growth and development. A four-year project funded by the Common Fund for Commodities (CFC) and implemented by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) hopes to realize this potential through the promotion of the production and use of High Quality Cassava Flour (HQCF). The US$4.5 million initiative covers 9000 small-scale farmers and processors in Zambia, Madagascar, and Tanzania, and will be supervised by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

	A ‘miracle’ plant, once thought to be the answer to producing renewable biofuels on a vast scale, is driving thousands of farmers in the developing world into food poverty, a damning report concludes today. Five years ago <i>jatropha</i> was hailed by investors and scientists as a breakthrough in the battle to find a biofuel alternative to fossil fuels that would not further impoverish developing countries by diverting resources away from food production. <i>Jatropha</i> was said to be resistant to drought and pests and able to grow on land that was unsuitable for food production. But researchers have found that it has increased poverty in countries such as India and Tanzania. (Source: the Independent, 15 February 2010)</p>

					<p>Maize production in West and Central Africa is set to get a much-needed boost with the release of improved varieties by the Nigeria National Variety Release Committee. The improved varieties address many of the major constraints to maize production such as drought, low soil fertility, pests, diseases, and parasitic weeds. Researchers developed the varieties through conventional plant breeding by tapping naturally-available traits. The released maize include 13 open-pollinated varieties of extra-early-, early-, intermediate-, and late-maturity with resistance to the parasitic weed <i>Striga hermonthica </i>and stem borers, tolerance to drought, and with good adaptation to sub-optimal soil nitrogen. Four hybrids with drought-tolerance have also been released. (Source: ScienceDaily 15 February 2010)</p>

The strain of sorghum -- a staple food in the country -- has proven to be acid-aluminium tolerant. Tanzania explains that the patenting of this crop by the US or Brazil would be a fatal blow to its food security, and moreover it violates international treaties. It would also increase local food prices as multinational corporations seek to exploit their patent to boost profits by selling sorghum seeds at high prices at a time when millions of Tanzanians currently living under conditions of abject poverty are struggling to put food on their table.

					<p>Farmers in mixed crop-livestock systems produce about half of the world’s food. In small holdings around the world, livestock are reared mostly on grass, browse, and non-food biomass from maize, millet, rice, and sorghum crops and in their turn supply manure and traction for future crops. Animals act as insurance against hard times and supply farmers with a source of regular income from sales of milk, eggs, and other products. Thus, faced with population growth and climate change, small-holder farmers should be the first target for policies to intensify production by carefully managed inputs of fertilizer, water, and feed to minimize waste and environmental impact, supported by improved access to markets, new varieties, and technologies.

					<p>A fertilizer-use study by researchers on East African highland bananas showed that moderate application of mineral fertilizers could double the production of the crop. However, the study also found that majority of the banana growers in the region does not use fertilizers, missing out on the opportunity to maximize their crop's food security and economic potentials. Over 70 million people in the East African highlands depend on banana as their primary source of food and income. The USAID-funded study carried out by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in nearly 200 farmer fields in Uganda showed that modest fertilizer use can significantly increase the crop's yield.

	Support is growing for a bid to persuade the G8+5 nations to fund 1,000 senior research positions in African universities. The Academic Chairs for Africa initiative would require the rich G8 countries and the emerging economies that now attend the group's gatherings — Brazil, China, India, South Africa and Mexico — to commit US$100m per year over a five-year period. The initiative is modelled on a ten-year-old Canadian programme aimed at preventing promising academics from leaving the country. The African version will be discussed at a meeting of the science academies from the G8+5 countries which takes place in Canada next month (4–5 March). African chair holders stand to receive US$100,000 a year, a substantially higher amount than professors usually earn at most African universities. They would be expected to train PhDs, mentor young academics and prove that they were using their research to address the UN's Millennium Development Goals.

	Population growth, arable land and fresh water limits, and climate change have profound implications for the ability of agriculture to meet this century’s demands for food, feed, fibre and fuel while reducing the environmental impact of their production. Success depends on the acceptance and use of contemporary molecular techniques, as well as the increasing development of farming systems that use saline water and integrate nutrient flows.

					<p>The nation's science enterprise still carries the scars of apartheid. But with reform — and increased funding — South Africa could become a catalyst for scientific progress throughout Africa. The country's science system continues to experience difficulties. In addition to inadequate funding, it suffers from a lack of qualified research students. This is a direct result of the government's failure to address the legacy of apartheid education. However, there is reason for optimism. The South African research community's long alienation from the government is at last a thing of the past. And in May 2009, newly elected president Jacob Zuma appointed Naledi Pandor as his minister of science and technology. (Source: Nature, 11 February 2010)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>European research ministers have made a commitment to increase investments in research and development (R&amp;D) and create a culture of trust in scientists. The ministers were gathered in the Spanish town of San Sebastián for an informal meeting of the Competitiveness Council. The delegates also unanimously adopted the Donostia Declaration, which Spain describes as 'a document that will launch the concept of a responsive and responsible science, capable of providing solutions in the short term'. The declaration explains that in addition to developing new products and services, research relies on advanced materials, equipment and infrastructures, much of which is supplied by European companies.

					<p>As the global food security conference in Amman wrapped up in the first week of February, scientists announced the formation of an international network to enhance food security to counter the effects of climate change in dry areas. Through the Amman Declaration on Food Security and Climate Change in Dry Areas, scientists pledged to enhance food security and reduce vulnerability to climate change in agriculture in the dry areas. The Declaration included a range of specific actions covering natural resource management, food production systems, policies and institutions, energy and regional.
