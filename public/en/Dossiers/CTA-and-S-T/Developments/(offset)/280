						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>W. Akinyi Nyonje and colleagues from the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Nairobi, Kenya, conducted a series of experiments to determine the phytochemical and anti-nutrient content of ten amaranth (<i>Amaranthus</i> spp.) varieties at two growth stages, before and after flowering. Amaranth vegetable is widely consumed in Kenya and contributes to the alleviation of food insecurity. It is reported to have bioactive components such as antioxidants that help in protecting the body from long-term degenerative diseases. However, amaranth vegetable has also been shown to contain some anti-nutrients which may bind nutrients and reduce their bioavailability in the body. Results showed significant differences in the phytochemical and anti-nutrient content among the varieties and at the different harvest stages. As the plants matured, the anti-nutrient content increased. The anti-nutrient activity also increased with maturity, from vegetative to post-flowering stage. It is recommended that amaranth leaves be consumed before flowering as they have generally lower anti-nutrients. Among the ten varieties, <i>A. cruentus</i> had the lowest anti-nutrients and the highest phytochemicals concentrations. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jas/article/view/33443" target="_self">http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jas/article/view/33443</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Journal of Agricultural Science</i>, 03/2014)</p>

					<p>This research programme conducted by the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, the Universität Innsbruck (Austria), and the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ, Germany) investigates the relationship between land use and biodiversity, and between biodiversity and the ecosystem service of biological control. Furthermore, it provides a framework for estimating the value of biological control. As a model pest, APPEAL uses cereal aphid. The results generated are intended to support assessing multiple ecosystem services by providing a clear and adaptable structure for incorporating ecosystem service values into land-use change scenarios. A key research question looks into the advantages and disadvantages of biocontrol services as compared to conventional plant protection. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.ekol.slu.se/appeal/" target="_self">http://www2.ekol.slu.se/appeal/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(APPEAL, 2014)</p>

					<p>A team of agronomists, entomologists, agro-ecologists, horticulturists and bio-geochemists from the Pennsylvania State University's College of Agricultural Sciences, led by Meagan Schipanski, has been developing a framework for considering a suite of ecosystem services that could be derived from agricultural land. The team quantified the benefits offered by cover crops across more than 10 ecosystem services. Benefits included increased carbon and nitrogen in soils, erosion prevention, more mycorrhizal colonisation – beneficial soil fungus that helps plants absorb nutrients – and weed suppression. By integrating a suite of ecosystem services into a unified analytical framework, the researchers highlighted the potential for cover crops to influence a wide array of ecosystem services. They estimated that cover crops increased eight of 11 ecosystem services. In addition, they demonstrated the importance of considering temporal dynamics when assessing management system effects on ecosystem services. &nbsp;Editor’s note: Cover cropping has been practiced by smallholder farmers in developing countries for several years. This research confirms the reasoning for maintaining this practice. &nbsp;<a href="http://news.psu.edu/story/308073/2014/03/18/research/research-reveals-true-value-cover-crops-farmers-environment" target="_self">http://news.psu.edu/story/308073/2014/03/18/research/research-reveals-true-value-cover-crops-farmers-environment</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Pennsylvania State University, 18/03/2014)</p>

					<p>The Koga irrigation scheme in Ethiopia was finalised in May 2012 and more than 10,000 households residing in the irrigation scheme have started year-round crop production. Because many farmers in Koga irrigation scheme are new to irrigated vegetable crops production and post harvest handling practices, they do not know how to produce and process seeds of different vegetable crops and thus need to purchase imported seed from local private vegetable seed retailers. This situation posed a number of issues. The quantity of each imported seed package is too much for what the farmers require and the price of packed vegetable seeds is often too expensive for most smallholders. On top of this, most farmers do not have adequate knowledge and skills to raise and manage vegetable seedlings. This situation is creating a favourable environment for small entrepreneurs to raise and market vegetable seedlings in the area in the way that's practical and affordable for the scheme's smallholders. These local businesses create trust among farmers and input suppliers, often serving as alternative extension service providers with their expertise as seedling producers. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://lives-ethiopia.org/2014/01/15/vegetable_seedlings/" target="_self">http://lives-ethiopia.org/2014/01/15/vegetable_seedlings/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(LIVES Ethiopia, 15/01/2014)</p>

					<p>Mohammed Suleiman, at the Department of Biology, Umaru Musa Yar’adua University, Katsina, Nigeria, carried out a series of experiments to determine the efficacy of three edible spices – garlic (<i>Allium sativum L.</i>), chili pepper (<i>Capsicum frutescens L.</i>), and ginger (<i>Zingiber officinale Rosc.</i>) against the weevil <i>Sitophilus zeamais</i> reared on sorghum grains. All the spices applied at varying amounts resulted in 100% adult mortality, showing similar effects to the conventional insecticide Permethrin. The strong aroma and contact toxicity of the spices give them the protectant properties looked for in natural pest management strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.academicjournals.org/journal/AJAR/article-abstract/27D9A1244784" target="_self">http://www.academicjournals.org/journal/AJAR/article-abstract/27D9A1244784</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>African Journal of Agricultural Research</i>, 02/2014)</p>

					<p>Hiroshi Masuda and colleagues from the Research Institute for Bioresources and Biotechnology in Japan describe seven transgenic approaches, and combinations thereof, that can be used to increase the concentration of iron (Fe) in rice seeds. Approaches examined by the scientists include the enhancement of the Fe storage capacity of grains through expression of the Fe storage protein ferritin, the introduction of the barley genes to enhance Fe uptake and translocation within plants, the enhancement of Fe translocation by overproducing the natural metal chelator nicotianamine. They also examined a number of combinations of the different approaches. All individual or combined approaches have the potential to further increase the Fe concentration of rice seeds. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thericejournal.com/content/6/1/40" target="_self">http://www.thericejournal.com/content/6/1/40</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>The Rice Journal</i>, 19/12/2013)</p>

					<p>A team of scientists from Australia, led by Simon J. Conn of the University of Adelaide, developed a protocol for an optimised plant hydroponic culture system that can be quickly and cheaply constructed, and that produces plants with similar growth kinetics to soil-grown plants. Hydroponic growth systems are a convenient platform for studying whole plant physiology, but in most hydroponic systems that the team tested grew plants poorly amenable to a number of common physiological assays, grew poorly.&nbsp; The system they developed has the advantage of being a versatile platform for a myriad of physiological and molecular biological measurements on all plant tissues at all developmental stages. The paper presents 'tips and tricks' for the easy adoption of this hydroponic culture system. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.plantmethods.com/content/9/1/4" target="_self">http://www.plantmethods.com/content/9/1/4</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>Plant Methods</i>, 05/02/2014)</p>

					<p>The key messages in this brief on tertiary agricultural education (TAE) produced by the World Bank are as follows: (i) The low level of human capital in Africa's agricultural sector remains a significant constraint to growth, poverty reduction, and food security on the continent; (ii) Agricultural education has been neglected for several decades and is poorly prepared to address the need for qualified professionals; (iii) African ministers and leaders have asked for 'a radically new approach' to agriculture education, as the current system is out of step with the job market. At present the students are passive receivers of knowledge with little ability to use it once graduated. The vision for change in learning paradigm within TAE sees future graduates receiving less theoretical knowledge and instead being capacitated to see and analyse reality, reflect if they have adequate knowledge or need to add more. In interacting with the world through experiential learning, graduates will be equipped with a toolbox of skills and methods, which they apply on the ground. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2014/03/19197973/human-capital-agriculture-africa" target="_self">http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2014/03/19197973/human-capital-agriculture-africa</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(World Bank, 01/03/2014)</p>

					<p>Mark Eisler, Michael Lee (both working at the School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol, UK) and colleagues highlight eight strategies to cut the environmental and economic costs of livestock farming systems while boosting net gains for the quantity and quality of the food they produce. Examples of their strategies are: feed animals less human food (using local crop residues and opening marginal areas to grazing); raise regionally appropriate animals (using adapted breeds reduces the cost of feed and veterinary services); keep animals healthy (with better animal management to contain transmissible disease and lower animal density); and adopt smart supplements (supplement made from plant extracts found locally can provide feed protein, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ammonia). The authors suggest that governments and policy-makers should support research efforts to identify the most beneficial microbes and most limiting nutrients, as well as low-cost ways to deliver them. Other strategies include eating meat of better quality, tailor practices to local culture, track cost and benefits, and study best practices. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/agriculture-steps-to-sustainable-livestock-1.14796" target="_self">http://www.nature.com/news/agriculture-steps-to-sustainable-livestock-1.14796</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>Nature</i>, 06/03/2014)</p>

					<p>The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) is testing a new rice fortification technique in Bangladesh to enrich it with the vital nutrient zinc. While zinc fortified fertiliser is available, only 30-40% of farmers use it, and 70-80% of zinc fertiliser is of sub-par quality. In rice’s journey from farm to fork, milling and polishing also removes the zinc from rice. As the most consolidated part of the farm-to-fork process, mills have the greatest potential reach. This is where GAIN is exploring increasing the nutrient density of rice through ‘fortifying at soak’. Fortifying at soak is the process of adding micronutrients to the water rice soaks in at the mill. By adding nutrients to the soaking water the rice absorbs the nutrient directly into the grain avoiding the removal of the nutrients during milling and polishing. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/gain-partner-zone/gallery/2014/mar/13/rice-fortification-in-pictures" target="_self">http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/gain-partner-zone/gallery/2014/mar/13/rice-fortification-in-pictures</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>The Guardian</i>, 18/03/2014)</p>

					<p>IFAD and the Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security Organisation (CCAFS) commissioned two studies with the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD) to identify supporting and hindering factors for the adoption of conservation agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa. The first reviewed the effects of conservation agriculture on crop yields, identifying the agro-ecological and management conditions that favour positive crop responses. The second study, explored the merits of an assessment tool to predict the likelihood of conservation agriculture adoption in a given project region. &nbsp;&nbsp;The key findings from the first study proved that the combination of the three main principles of conservation agriculture are not, in many situations, an option. For instance, no-tillage has to be associated with mulching to result in higher crop yield. Additionally, crop rotation has to be an integral component with farmers moving from continuous mono-cropping systems to the inclusion of different crop types and preferably vegetables. These two factors are, for many smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, the bottlenecks to adoption. Crop residues have several other competing uses on the farm, in particular as feed for livestock. &nbsp; &nbsp;The second study explored the degree of accuracy of the qualitative expert assessment tool for conservation agriculture adoption (QAToCA). It discovered that the QAToCA tool can help in identification of the socio-ecological niches (e.g. preferences, prices, production objectives etc.) and specific sites for successful promotion of diverse CA practices and technologies. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://ifad-un.blogspot.nl/2014/03/conservation-agriculture-factors-for.html" target="_self">http://ifad-un.blogspot.nl/2014/03/conservation-agriculture-factors-for.html</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(IFAD social reporting blog, 25/03/2014)</p>

					<p>The Trust for Advancement of Agricultural Sciences (TAAS), the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and the Asia-Pacific Association of Agricultural Research Institutions (APAARI), organised a <i>National Workshop on Outscaling Farm Innovation</i> on 3-5 September 2013. Since India made considerable investment in technology systems and farmers’ development programmes, farmers have taken lead in inventing new methods of sharing within farming communities. The workshop served as a platform to share, improve and out-scale these farming innovations. The themes covered were crop practices, natural resource management, mechanization and post-harvest activities, livestock, cultivation of high value commodities, diversification, energy, institutional requirements, policy issues, etc. This publication summarises the discussions and the recommendations that emerged from the event. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apaari.org/publications/outscaling-farm-innovation-2013.html" target="_self">http://www.apaari.org/publications/outscaling-farm-innovation-2013.html</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(APAARI, 2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	CTA is a member of a consortium of 16 partners involved in the EU 7th Framework Programme PACE-Net Plus project “<i>Pacific Europe Network for Science, Technology and Innovation</i>.” This 3-year project with a budget of €3 million is coordinated by IRD (Institut de Recherche pour le Développement), France.Considering the results of past and ongoing initiatives supporting EU-Pacific ST&amp;I cooperation, PACE-Net Plus will:


Support EU-Pacific policy dialogue in ST&amp;I, including dialogue on innovation issues.

Reinforce EU-Pacific ST&amp;I cooperation, focusing on 3 major societal challenges (in the field of health, demographic change and wellbeing; food security, sustainable agriculture, marine and maritime research and the bio-economy; and climate action, resource use and efficiency, and raw material).

Encourage coordination by promoting the implementation of joint EU-Pacific actions.

Enhance cooperation on innovation issues, by helping to bridge the gap between public and private sectors.

Strengthen Pacific-EU research cooperation partnerships, through the promotion of Horizon 2020 and other programmes among the Pacific research community, as well as Pacific opportunities for European researchers.


Together with the University of Papua New Guinea (UNPG), CTA will co-lead work package 2 (WP2) “Strengthening the EU-Pacific ST&amp;I cooperation in the field of food security, sustainable agriculture, marine and maritime research and the bio-economy.”&nbsp; CTA is also a partner in WP 4 on “Enhancing the cooperation on innovation issues to tackle the societal challenges which is led by UNIDO/UNPG”, WP 5 on “Strengthening the Pacific-EU research cooperation partnerships” and WP 6 “Support to the bi-regional policy dialogue in ST&amp;I.”<b> </b><b>&nbsp;</b>Consortium meetings have been held in Noumea, New Zealand/Australia and most recently, EU-based partners met on 10 February 2014 in Brussels, Belgium. More information about this project and the partners is available on the project website <a href="http://www.pacenet.eu" target="_self">www.pacenet.eu</a>.</p>

	The Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation – ACP/EU (CTA),<i>&nbsp;</i>launched a call for proposals in December 2013 on innovations in use or which have potential in smallholder agricultural production systems in ACP countries and which, if known and widely promoted, can benefit other farming communities<i>. Due to statutory requirements, we extended the deadline to 09 March.</i>We have received approximately<b>&nbsp;200</b> entries from <b>41 countries</b> in the ACP-EU region so far. 30% were submitted in French. Most of the proposals fall in the category farmer-led, followed closely by research-led and university-led innovations. &nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i>What’s Next </i></b>Proposals will undergo a three-step evaluation based on the pre-determined evaluation criteria :1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preliminary review:A jury consisting of a multidisciplinary &amp; bi-lingual (en/fr) panel of scientists, extension agents and farmers will do a preliminary review of the entries, which should lead to a shortlist of about 40-50 proposals.2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Voting on shortlist:Through our network of agencies, farmers will be invited to vote on the shortlist and about 30 that have the highest potential to change smallholders’ lives will be selected3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A high-level international expert panel will choose the top 20 innovations.4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The top 20 will be published and widely disseminated.CTA wishes to thank all those who submitted proposals. We are counting on your continued support as we go through the next stages. We look forward to announcing the 20 top in the near future.Earlier, the call:&nbsp;<a href="http://knowledge.cta.int/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Fellowships-grants-calls/Call-for-Proposals-CTA-Top-20-Innovations-for-Smallholder-farmers" target="_self">http://knowledge.cta.int/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Fellowships-grants-calls/Call-for-Proposals-CTA-Top-20-Innovations-for-Smallholder-farmers</a></p>

					<p>M. Y. Teweldemedhin and L. Mwewa of the Department of Agriculture, Polytechnic of Namibia, Namibia present a comprehensive review of the status quo of developments bio-fuels including support measures driving the social, environmental and economic impacts of their development. Their key findings indicated that, if the biofuel market proves lucrative, there is possible diversion of labour and land to bio-fuel projects and that competition of input use might lead to reduction of food production and high food prices. However the price of bio-fuel feedstock from jatropha in Zambia was not attractive enough to encourage farmers to grow more jatropha which has raised major concerns by policy makers. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.academicjournals.org/journal/AJAR/article-abstract/A05DC3E42807" target="_self">http://www.academicjournals.org/journal/AJAR/article-abstract/A05DC3E42807</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>African Journal of Agricultural Research</i>, 18/12/2014)</p>
