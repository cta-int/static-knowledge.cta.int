						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>A team of researchers from the University of Georgia, U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute, Hudson Alpha Institute for Biotechnology, North Dakota State University and University of California Davis has recently released the genome sequence for the common bean – which includes a number of varieties that together rank as the world’s 10th most widely grown food crop. The new whole-genome sequencing will also help to identify genetic 'markers' that can be used to speed up breeding of new bean varieties in the United States, East Africa and other countries. All of the well-known bean varieties have the highly valued ability to form symbiotic relationships with 'nitrogen-fixing' bacteria in the soil. One of the goals of the sequencing project was to better understand the genetic basis on which symbiotic relationships between nitrogen-fixing plants and bacteria are formed and sustained. The new sequencing identified a handful of genes involved with moving nitrogen around, which could be helpful to farmers who intercrop beans with other crops that don’t fix nitrogen. The researchers also discovered dense clusters of genes related to disease resistance within the chromosomes. &nbsp;&nbsp;(UC Davis, 09/06/2014)</p>

					<p>Bonaventure Kissinger Maalekuu, of the Department of Horticulture, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana and colleagues conducted a survey to assess the pre-storage treatments applied to yam, methods adopted for storage and farmers knowledge on postharvest losses. In addition a proximate analysis to determine the nutritional variation of White yam cultivars, Pona and Tela, was conducted before and after storage. The survey revealed that only few farmers apply agro-chemicals to their harvested tubers before storage. Yam is stored in yam barn (major method) or stored in heaps on a floor or in open sided structures, depending on time of harvest. All three storage methods caused a significant reduction of the nutritional composition of the tubers. The open sided storage structures performed best with respect to lower weight loss, sprouting, decay, pest damage and nutritional composition. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Journal of Agricultural Science</i>, 15/06/2014)</p>

					<p>The EC commissioned LEI Wageningen UR this study to investigate what the effects of a 40% reduction in food waste at the household and retail level would be on the economy. The study shows that such reduction could result in annual savings of € 123 per person and the total savings for the EU of € 75.5 billion. However, the total effect on the EU economy will be negligible. The reduction in food waste on the demand side (household and retail) will mean that much less agricultural land will be needed for growing food (in the EU, agricultural land use will be reduced by 28,940 km2 – an area of the size of Belgium). Most of this agricultural land will be freed up because of a reduction in waste of dairy products, fruits and vegetables and red and white meat. The study reveals however that results would be greater if European households would adopt healthy eating patterns in terms of lowering consumption of meats and dairy instead of reducing food waste. Follow-up research is necessary to determine what the results would be of reducing food losses on the supply side (agriculture, the processing industry, storage and transport) and food losses and waste in the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Editor’s note</b>: ACP governments need similar evidence from their national and regional universities to support decision-making. &nbsp;(LEI Wageningen UR, 16/04/2014)</p>

					<p>AgroCentral will be a web and SMS application connecting small farmers directly with buyers. The idea for this app was born at a Startup Weekend Jamaica (SWJA) in October 2013 and will be launched in August 2014. AgroCentral uses an eBay-like model allowing farmers to alert buyers via SMS when they have a crop they wish to sell, helping them to cut out the middleman, negotiate higher margins and gauge supply and demand in the market. Farmers simply send an SMS to a central website, quoting the type of product on offer, the quantity available and their desired price. Buyers can either view these posts on the AgroCentral website or – if they have registered interest in buying, they will also receive a SMS. The buyers can directly negotiate with farmers and also send a request to the website. The request will be relayed to all registered farmers who produce that particular crop using SMS. Buyers can also access full profiles of registered farmers, including their location, crops grown and supply capability. The benefit to farmers is that they can quickly find a market for perishable produce. &nbsp; &nbsp;(Trade &amp; Export Finance, 09/05/2014)</p>

					<p>In a development that could revolutionize the management of precious groundwater around the world, Stanford researchers Jessica Reeves, Rosemary Knight, Howard Zebker and Peter Kitanidis have pioneered the use of satellites to accurately measure levels of water stored hundreds of feet below ground. Their findings were published recently in <i>Water Resources Research</i>. Until now, the only way a water manager could gather data about the state of water tables in a watershed was to drill monitoring wells. In their novel approach, the scientists used Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to monitor changes in the elevation of Earth's surface. With this technology they could measure groundwater levels across vast areas without using lots of on-the-ground monitors. InSAR data could play a vital role in measuring seasonal changes in groundwater supply and help determine levels for sustainable water use. &nbsp;&nbsp;(Stanford University, 17/06/2014)</p>

	In this paper, Tara Garnett, of the Food Climate Research Network (FCRN, UK), considers the increasingly topical question of 'What is a sustainable healthy diet?' She begins by highlighting the rationale for focusing on the diets question, and then moves on to discussing definitions of ‘good nutrition’ on the one hand, and ‘sustainability’ on the other.&nbsp; The main substance of her argument focus on the major food groups that constitute UK’s Eat-well plate, examining the health and sustainability issues that their consumption raises.&nbsp; She also included a review of recent studies in this area. An important limitation of her paper is that it focuses largely on developed country contexts. Being a discussion paper, FCRN is looking for input from members in low income and emerging economies, where the sustainability and health issues play out very differently. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.fcrn.org.uk/fcrn/publications/fcrn-discussion-paper-what-sustainable-healthy-diet" target="_self">FCRN</a>, 04/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Andrew Leakey, plant biology professor at the University of Illinois, US, and colleagues report that levels of zinc, iron and protein drop in some key crop plants when grown at elevated CO2 levels. The teams simulated high CO2 levels in open-air fields using a system called Free Air Concentration Enrichment (FACE), which pumps out, monitors and adjusts ground-level atmospheric CO2 to simulate future conditions. The experiments revealed that the nutritional quality of a number of the world’s most important plants dropped in response to elevated CO2. Zinc and iron went down significantly in wheat, rice, field peas and soybeans. Wheat and rice also saw notable declines in protein content at higher CO2. Nutrients in millet, sorghum and maize remained relatively stable at higher CO2 levels because these crops use a type of photosynthesis, called C4, which already concentrates carbon dioxide in their leaves. &nbsp; &nbsp;(<a href="http://news.illinois.edu/news/14/0507CO2_AndrewLeakey.html" target="_self">University of Illinois</a>, 07/05/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	Professor Steven Underhill of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) describes how research in the South Pacific is being tailored to boost Fiji fruit and vegetable exports. His impression of postharvest handling systems in the South Pacific was that of a sub-optimal system which lacks reliable infrastructure and technology. For example, packaging is inappropriate for transporting produce any distance (i.e. old boxes and sacks are used), packing facilities are limited, trucks overloaded with produce travel along rough roads, and refrigeration is non-existent. Given these apparent postharvest limitations, Underhill believes improvements to postharvest practices present big opportunities to benefit local farmers. Historically, postharvest efforts have centred on introducing a concept of 'post-harvest best practice' from outside the region. Over the past decade, this approach has led to the construction of packing sheds and improved packaging with cool storage, and general post-harvest training for farmer groups. However, Underhill feels much more could still be done to tailor solutions to the local context and maximise benefits for smallholder farmers. Understanding local needs and analysing the post-harvest supply chains should be top priorities for post-harvest &nbsp;science. &nbsp; &nbsp;(<a href="http://aciarblog.blogspot.nl/2014/05/postharvest-science-in-south-pacific.html" target="_self">ACIAR</a>, 06/05/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;(Photo source: sxcreenshot grab from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Svtv2ZuFZ4E" target="_blank">ACIAR's PARDI work in Fiji</a>)</p>

					<p>The Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) has produced a report on extrusion technology. Extrusion technology is central to value addition to agricultural commodities, especially cereals and legumes: it is a powerful process that combines several operations, including mixing, cooking, kneading, shearing, shaping, and forming. This high-temperature short-time (HTST) process usually reduces microbial contamination, inactivates enzymes, and facilitates the elimination of anti-nutrient factors, resulting in products that are in a dry state with typically low water activity, which do not require refrigeration storage. Several researchers in Africa have made considerable progress in product development using extrusion technology for the development and production of traditional-based products from indigenous materials. Extrusion has great potential in tropical developing economies where infrastructure for a cold supply chain is inadequate. &nbsp;&nbsp;Editor’s note: Cost effectiveness is a crucial issue in determining suitability of this technology. There must be a sufficient throughput&nbsp; of raw material to justify the investment. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.ift.org/food-technology/past-issues/2014/april/features/extrusioncooking.aspx?page=viewall" target="_self">IFT</a>, 04/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Paul Weisenfel, vice president for Global Programs at RTI International, comments on the renewed interest in agricultural production shown by governments and the private sector. While many new technologies in agriculture are being touted as answers to the world’s food security challenges, Weisenfel notes that the bulk of research has been expended on these new technologies with insufficient attention to determining how best to scale them up. According to him, what is needed is a combination of the hard and soft sciences to effectively get smallholders to use these new technologies on a large scale. Weisenfel suggests a focus on three broad areas of research that could dramatically increase uptake: (i) combination of technologies (both new and existing) that work best in particular agro-ecological zones; (ii) better tools to quantify and disaggregate the barriers to adoption; and (iii) sophisticated economic modelling to better understand the market dynamics that drive or inhibit adoption of technologies. With a market-led, design-centred approach – understanding the needs (expressed and latent) and modelling the markets' ability to respond – Weisenfel believes it is possible to guide programmes to address market constraints to adoption. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://globalfoodforthought.typepad.com/global-food-for-thought/2014/05/commentary-using-science-to-drive-adoption-of-new-technologies.html" target="_self">The Chicago Council on Global Affairs</a>, 05/05/2014) &nbsp;</p>

					<p>Tom MacMillan, director of innovation at the Soil Association, Bristol, UK, and Tim G. Benton, who leads the United Kingdom's Global Food Security programme and is professor of population ecology at the University of Leeds, UK, argue that the next wave of agricultural innovation must be at smaller scales and engage farmers directly in scientific research efforts. Enhancing farmers' own R&amp;D could reap big rewards for minimal extra cost as farmers everywhere are practical experimentalists who understand the idiosyncrasies of their land. Technologies not invented by farmers – new kit, seeds or chemicals – are almost always adapted by farmers&nbsp; to fit their circumstance but such essential contributions are rarely recognised in official assessments of agricultural R&amp;D. These count farmers as users, rather than makers, of knowledge. Some of the best returns can come from helping farmers to assess their own ideas. Until now, such initiatives have been at arm's length from formal science, and almost exclusively in the developing world. The authors' involvement in a farmer-focused innovation programme in the UK has convinced them that such participatory R&amp;D could also boost agricultural innovation in rich countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;Editor’s note: Interesting development. For many years this participatory R&amp;D approach was promoted for the Southern research community and perhaps, with this development, it will be more widely embraced by all scientists striving to make a difference and enhance the impact of research. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/agriculture-engage-farmers-in-research-1.15108" target="_self">Nature</a>, 30/04/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>In April 2014 African science ministers met to sign off the Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy for Africa (STISA) – Africa’s 10-year (2014-2024) blueprint for science, technology and innovation – ahead of the continent’s presidential summit scheduled for 20-27 June 2014 in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea. The plan succeeds the Consolidated Plan of Action for science and technology (CPA), which has directed continental policy over the past decade. STISA addresses the weaknesses of the CPA, which too narrowly focused on R&amp;D and fundraising, rather than using science to address Africa’s problems. STISA was drawn up after a review of the CPA by a high-level panel, led by Calestous Juma and has a stronger focus on innovation and ‘science for development’ than its predecessor. The strategy is anchored in six priority areas which include ' Eradication of hunger and achieving food security'. Aggrey Ambali, of UA/NEPAD Science Technology and Innovation Hub (NSTIH), gave <a href="http://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/27620?show=full" target="_self">a presentation of STISA</a> at the First Bio-Innovate Regional Scientific Conference (Ethiopia, February 2013). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://goo.gl/oVggvB" target="_self">Lynda Nordling reports for <i>Research Africa</i></a>, 12/05/2014) &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
