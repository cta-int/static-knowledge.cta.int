						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p> 
A Chinese company, ZTE International, is to invest US$1 billion in a 3 million hectare oil palm plantation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to produce biofuels. The vast Central-African country is a potential bioenergy 'superpower' which could supply a large part of the world's fuel needs. But it faces some hard choices. Congo is home to the world's second largest undisturbed tropical rainforest, an invaluable hotspot of biodiversity and carbon sink that is increasingly under pressure from illegal logging operations. A rush into the biofuel sector could threaten these ecosystems further. The Congolese are beginning to understand the world-changing prospect that in a post-oil era, their country, together with Brazil, will largely determine the energy security of the world. The DRC's new government has just recently established an interministerial commission on biofuels to assess the complex opportunities and the many risks of this future.Source: Biopact, 28 July 2007 </p>

‘Science, technology and innovation are necessities, not luxuries, for the world´s 50 poorest nations,’ says UNCTAD's Least Developed Countries Report 2007. The report asks the governments of least developed countries (LDC) to adopt policies to spur science, technology and innovation, just as developed countries do. The developed countries, on the other hand, should focus on knowledge-based development in which science, technology and innovation (STI) policies are given a key role. The report regrets that such policies were sidelined by the structural adjustment programmes of the 1980s and 1990s and notes that current Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers have failed to re-introduce them. New policies need to be appropriate to the level of technological development, the economic structure, and the capabilities of the country concerned. A one-size-fits-all approach will not work, says the report, and pleads for step to make the intellectual property rights (IPR) system more compatible with the needs of LDCs, to reduce the brain drain of skilled professionals to industrialised countries, and to increase official aid in support of science, technology and innovation in LDCs.Source: IPS, 27 July 2007 </p>

					<p> 
Malawi, one of the world’s most welcoming cultures and poorest nations, struggles to provide for itself in the wake of the ‘green revolution.’ The plight of Malawian farmers mirrors that of India’s rain-fed farmers. As India prepares for a second green revolution, it would do well to learn from the failure of intensive agriculture in Malawi. For much of the early twentieth century, Nyasaland, as it was called before independence, was thought of as a success case to be emulated in southern Africa. It had a flourishing export economy of tea and tobacco, and subsistence farmers were producing decent yields based on the old system of extensive, shifting cultivation. It seemed like the perfect place for the green revolution to capitalize on the gains that Malawians had made and create a thriving nation of farmers. Now, even in a year of good rains Malawi has an agricultural shortfall, and has become heavily dependent upon outside aid agencies to provide food security. How does a nation of farmers become unable to feed themselves? What happened?Source: Alan Bush, African Agriculture, 26 July 2007 </p>

The biotechnology tool of marker-assisted selection (MAS) has raised high expectations for increasing genetic progress through breeding. Some experts have even argued that the application of MAS could ‘revolutionize’ the way varieties and breeding stock are developed. A new comprehensive assessment (Marker-Assisted Selection, Rome 2007), emphasizes that MAS has enormous potential but notes that the technology has not yet delivered its expected benefits to farmers in developing countries. Shivaji Pandey, Chairperson of the FAO Working Group on Biotechnology, gives his views on MAS. Despite the potential benefits, Pandey says that the costs associated with MAS mean that the technology should only be used where there is a clear advantage over traditional breeding techniques. Additionally, MAS should only be adopted in those countries where well-structured breeding programs are already in place. Source:FAO Newsroom, 24 July 2007

A draft charter on the African statistics was recently adopted by 43 representatives of national institutes of statistics from Africa. The meeting was chaired by the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) in partnership with the African Union Commission. Romain Murenzi, Rwanda's minister in the office of the president in charge of science, technology and scientific research, said that in recent years, there had been an increase in demand for statistics partly to satisfy the need to monitor such initiatives as NEPAD, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Poverty Reduction Strategies, as well as to provide data for evidence-based policy making generally. The charter will play an important role in promoting the integration of statistics, and in defining the fundamental principles for the production, storage, management, dissemination, and use of statistics throughout on the continent.Source: East African Business Week (Kampala), 2 July 2007 </p>

Kenya, South Africa and Tunisia have the best innovation climates in Africa, say business leaders. But despite a steady upward trend in economic growth, the continent still does not cut the mustard to attract significant R&amp;D investment from industry. Data to this effect comes from a survey published at the World Economic Forum ‘Davos for Africa’ meeting in Cape Town from 13 to 15 June. It captures the perceptions of leading business executives from a cross-section of firms operating in Africa. Of the 29 countries surveyed, Tunisia receives the most consistently high rating for its innovation capacity. It is the only country to register in the top three in all nine categories pertaining to science and technology. It also gets the top overall score. The report also compares Africa’s four largest economies – South Africa, Algeria, Nigeria and Egypt – to the Bric (Brazil, Russia, India and China) economies, suggesting the ‘Sane’ countries have the potential to be the drivers of African economic growth. As a result, the authors suggest, international investment in Africa should not only focus on the poorest, but also go into bolstering economies that are doing well.Source: Research Africa, 26 June 2007 </p>

					<p> 
A recent study has shown the possible impact on agriculture-dependent households in which either or both the adults have HIV/Aids. Some research organisations in the area of food security, for instance, anticipate that labour loss in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) because of the epidemic will be between 12.7% and 26% in the next two decades. Whichever way one looks at it, this is a frightening scenario. The FANRPAN study illustrates the possible impacts and responses of agriculture-dependent households in which either or both of the adults have HIV/Aids. The realisation that the countries most affected by HIV/Aids also experienced slow growth in agricultural productivity and an increase in food insecurity over the last two decades, has led to the establishment of national Aids commissions in every SADC country. Farmers’ associations have also started awareness programmes and are trying to link farmers to organisations dealing with HIV/Aids.Source: Mail &amp; Guardian, 30 April 2007. </p>

According to the latest figures from the FAO, paddy production in Africa has gone up for the 6th consecutive year, reaching 21.6 million tonnes in 2006 – 6% above 2005 – and NERICA has been identified as a major factor in this growth. Substantial production increases were reported in Burkina Faso, The Gambia, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and Togo. ‘We do not think that it is just a coincidence that Burkina Faso and Mali have had these spectacular successes. They were the first countries to evaluate and release the lowland NERICA varieties developed recently by the Africa Rice Center (WARDA) in association with national programs,’ said Dr Papa Abdoulaye Seck, WARDA Director General. Describing the recent surge in demand for NERICA seed in Nigeria, Dr Seck said that WARDA has been informed that the country was able to reduce its rice imports in 2005 by over 800,000 tonnes, thanks to the measures taken by the Nigerian Government to increase domestic rice production and decrease rice imports. Nigeria is the largest importer of rice in the world. West Africa is not the only region where NERICA is performing spectacularly. The varieties have leapfrogged from Guinea to Uganda in Eastern Africa, where they are blazing a new trail of success.Source: CGIAR Newsroom, 3 May 2007. </p>

					<p> 
In a move to protect deep sea ecosystems, over 20 nations have agreed to strict, voluntary limits on the practice of bottom trawling on the high seas of the South Pacific region, a quarter of the world’s oceans. The agreement calls for closure of areas to bottom fishing where vulnerable ecosystems - including seamounts and cold-water corals - are known to exist or likely to occur. Because bottom trawling activity in the region focuses on seamounts, the accord could effectively end this fishing practice in the South Pacific. The agreement will take effect on 30 September 2007 and will apply to the signatory nations. Observers and vessel monitoring systems will be used to track compliance, and vessels must stay at least five nautical miles from previously identified vulnerable areas or from areas where they encounter vulnerable ecosystems during fishing. The Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, an alliance of environmental and conservation groups, welcomed the agreement.Source: BBC World, 5 May 2007. </p>

					<p> 
The government has kick-started the disbursement of the 550 million Naira ($4 million) Millennium Development Goal (MDG) component of the Animal Traction and Handtools Technology loans scheme in Imo state. Adamu Bello, minister of agriculture, explained that the scheme was designed to provide credit facilities to rural farmers to acquire small farming technology, relieve farmers of drudgery and hardship associated with the use of traditional tools and improve their incomes. An FAO study of agricultural mechanisation in Sub-Saharan Africa has shown that only 1% of farm power was provided by mechanical means, 10% was powered by animals, and 89% from human labour. The government has put in place a complementary programme to promote the use of hand tools for those parts of the country where the use of draught animal power was not feasible due to environmental factors. The minister urged farmers to put the money into its intended purposes to enable them to produce more food and enhance their family income. They are expected to pay back the loans when due to enable other farmers to benefit from the scheme.Source: Business Day, 6 May 2007. </p>

					<p> 
Brazilian state farming research company, Embrapa, has announced it will invest in Africa, precisely in countries where China plans to fund the building of infrastructure. Embrapa plans to accompany Chinese investment in Africa, estimated at US$5 billion over the next five years, in order to gain a slice of the staff training, technical assistance, consulting, associated survey and technology transfer markets in Sub-Saharan Africa. Embrapa believes that investments by China will lead to a strong increase in demand for food goods in the African market, allowing for entry into the market of Brazilian goods such as agricultural machinery and equipment, seeds, production systems and even raw materials (soy, maize, rice, cotton) and meats. In 2006 Embrapa set up a research unit in Accra, the capital of Ghana, where a team of researchers has been carrying out surveys of the vast local market. ‘Embrapa’s technology, which is a world leader in tropical agriculture, covers all of Africa’s eco-systems. Not only with production technologies, but also in terms of management, specific crops, zoning and animal genetics, for example,’ said Crestana. Even with just four months of work in Africa, the demand has been ‘enormous’ he said. ‘There have been requests of every kind. For example, a Portuguese group has been looking for a partnership to plant 100,000 hectares of soy and set up a biodiesel factory for export to Europe,’ said Crestana.Source: Macau Hub, 7 May 2007. </p>

The Malawian government says it will continue involving the private sector in the fertiliser subsidy programme, but has asked the players not to form monopolistic cartels. Deputy agriculture minister Bintony Kutsaira said this during the launch of the Fertiliser Association in Lilongwe. The association will help government increase the national consumption of fertiliser from the current estimate of 200,000 metric tonnes through public-private collaboration. ‘The government has accorded the agriculture industry top priority in our development efforts. The participation of private sector in input distribution will allow the best use of modern agriculture technology to reduce, and ideally, eliminate chronic food insecurity,’ said the minister. Agriculture remains Malawi’s most important economic activity, but as only about 30% of farmers using fertilisers, government plans to increase the national consumption of input by subsidising the cost by 70%. The new association has 14 members, all of which are fertiliser companies involved in importing, blending, manufacturing, distribution and sale of fertiliser products. The body aims to ensure that government policy on fertiliser is conducive to the importation, manufacture, distribution and sale of fertiliser in Malawi and to act as a forum for engaging with government, donors and other stakeholders in the agriculture sector.Source: The Nation Malawi, 7 May 2007.   &nbsp;</p>

Kenya’s horticultural industry appears to be winning the battle to protect its huge European market in the face of a campaign by supermarkets in the UK to block its products over environmental concerns. A former British MP, Tony Colman, said strong lobbying in Britain had won the support of the media and owners of supermarkets, and sales of vegetables and flowers from Kenya had actually increased. Agriculture minister Kipruto Arap Kirwa said Kenya exports only 5% of its vegetables and the EU standards applied were also meant to protect the Kenyan public. Kenya will label horticultural products exported to counter campaigns against carbon miles. The label will inform consumers that horticultural products are produced under environmentally friendly conditions and meet international standards. Kirwa said complaints by Europe on carbon miles are baseless since Africa emits 1.2 tonnes per capita of carbon, while Europe and America emit 20 and 42 tonnes, respectively.Source: The Nation, 8 May 2007. </p>

					<p> 
The Indonesian government is looking into the possibility of investing in oil palm plantations in Tanzania, agriculture minister Anton Apriyantono has said. Indonesia and Malaysia currently supply 80% of the global demand for palm oil, while the remaining 20% come from Thailand and India, the minister said. Data from the agriculture ministry show Indonesia`s crude palm oil output reaches 16 million tonnes per year, 12 million tonnes of which are exported.Source: Antara, 8 May 2007. </p>

					<p> 
3700 Senegalese mango farmers are the latest members of an FAO project to encourage the export of organic and/or fair trade produce from Central and West Africa to Europe. The FAO’s implementing partner is Agrecol-Afrique, an organization with many years of experience in training farmers in various aspects of sustainable agriculture. Mango is an important dietary and export crop in Senegal. Agrecol-Afrique is now preparing them for organic production and fair trade, and to export the first in-transition-to-organic crop by the end of 2007. Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana and Sierra Leone are also involved in the project, which focuses on products in high demand in the European market, and with a good potential for high added value. Project partners are farmer groups, processors, exporters and importers, local NGOs, representatives of governments and the organic and fair trade movements.Source: Agriculture, 8 May 2007. </p>

					<p> 
Aid providers in Congo and elsewhere are discovering that lessons in farming can succeed where food handouts have not. The fields that ended hunger for Hen¬riette Lipepele’s family are squeezed between a trash-strewn dirt road and a cluster of one-room cinder-block houses. Ms. Lipepele’s beds of sweet potatoes and leafy bitekuteku are narrow and not quite straight; the patch where she added bananas and sugar cane seems almost overgrown with competing greenery. But these plant beds are examples of what many aid experts believe could save hundreds of thousands of people from hunger and malnutrition: urban gardens in the developing world’s fast-growing cities. 
Already in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, according to the UN, almost three-quarters of city residents live in rapidly growing slums. These trends present a huge challenge when it comes to food and nutrition. Bringing rural-grown produce to people living in infrastructure-poor cities is difficult. In any case, many impoverished city dwellers do not have money for fresh groceries. Many aid workers worry about a wave of city-based hunger. UN organizations and independent aid groups have started trying to find new ways to ease these stresses. And many see urban gardens as one possible answer.Source: Christian Science Monitor, 9 May 3007. </p>

					<p> 
The Global Bioenergy Partnership (<a href="http://www.globalbioenergy.org/" target="_blank">GBEP</a>) unveiled its website, which provides information on the Partnership, created in May 2006 to promote the use of bioenergy the secretariat of which is hosted at FAO. The website also offers links to sources of information on bioenergy and features news and a regularly updated list of bioenergy events. The mandate of the Partnership is to provide a global political forum to promote bioenergy and encourage the sustainable production, marketing and use of ‘green’ fuels, focussing in particular on developing countries. It will facilitate exchanges of know-how and technology, promote supportive policy frameworks and identify ways of fostering investments and removing barriers to the development and implementation of joint projects. GBEP is currently preparing a report on bioenergy policies, data and best practices in its member countries. The report will be published on the GBEP website later this year. GBEP also continues its focus on methodologies for measuring reductions of greenhouse gas emissions from bioenergy and on raising awareness and promoting information sharing. The Partnership brings together public, private and civil society stakeholders.Source: FAO Newsroom, 9 May 2007. </p>
