						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>A new rice plant has been developed which grows 'snorkels' when exposed to floods; the plant elongates rapidly in response to being submerged. Writing in Nature, Laurentius Voesenek of the Institute of Environmental Biology, Utrecht University, the Netherlands, describes how the Japanese scientists discovered the ‘snorkel’ genes in flood-tolerant rice, and introduced them to more sensitive high-yield rice. This finding could boost the production of rice in Asia and Africa, where up to 40% of crops are subject to flash floods or deep water.</p>

					<p><i>Artemisinin</i> is currently the most effective drug available against malaria. In August the Centre for Novel Agricultural Products at the University of York (UK) announced that, following an intensive year-long breeding program using (non-GM) molecular biology techniques, plants were developed with double the original yield. These are now being sent out to field testing in Africa, India and China. Obviously plants which have done well in the greenhouse may not do so well in the fields, subject to weather and pests, so further selection and breeding is necessary.</p>

					<p>The introduction of biotechnology to Africa must consider the needs and values of local people, argues socioeconomist Wilhemina Quaye at the Food Research Institute in Ghana. Africa has long debated the development and use of biotechnology. Advocates point to their potential for solving economic, social and environmental challenges. Critics focus on the low public funding available, problems with intellectual property rights, limited human capacity, poor infrastructure and biosafety issues. Quaye is of the opinion that anyone developing biotechnologies must respond effectively to the intended users' needs and aspirations, and better manage the perceived risks or threats associated with accepting biotechnology. To do this, biotech agendas must consider the socio-cultural realities in Africa. This will help build trust and public confidence, and aid the acceptance of biotechnology.</p>

	Experts warn that the world's growing population is depleting the world's wild fish stocks. The FAO says 70 percent of all the worlds' fisheries are barely able to replenish themselves at current catch rates. Cliff Goudey of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Offshore Aquaculture Engineering Center is developing a solution by building fish cages that can move under their own power. In future, giant, autonomous cages may whir as fish farms through the open ocean, mimicking the movements of wild schools or even allowing fish to forage ‘free range’ before capturing them once again. This technology gives fish farmers a way to rotate cage locations without towing cages behind boats.</p>

					<p>Common herbs and spices show promise as an environmentally-friendly alternative to conventional pesticides, scientists said at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society in Washington DC. The research team, led by Dr Murray Isman of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada spent a decade researching the insecticidal properties of rosemary, thyme, clove and mint. It was concluded that these plants could become a key weapon against insect pests in organic agriculture. Some spice-based commercial products now being used by farmers have already shown success in protecting organic strawberry, spinach, and tomato crops against destructive aphids and mites.</p>

					<p>A study conducted by IITA and the Africa College-University of Leeds in Tanzania reveals that local farmers are more interested on the productivity potential of genetically-modified (GM) crops than they are worried about the possible risks associated with their use. The study, completed in late June 2009, was carried out in consultation with the Mikocheni Agricultural Research Institute and the Tanzanian Commission for Science and Technology. It covered three districts in Tanzania. The research, which assessed the understanding and attitudes of local farmers toward GM crops using disease-resistant cassava as an example, also revealed that the level of awareness and basic understanding of GM crops by small-scale farmers is very low. Similarly, it was found that related knowledge level of local agricultural extension officers and district staff –– primary sources of information of the farmers –– was also inadequate.</p>

	The results of biosafety studies on GM crops are often controversially discussed in public debates. Michelle Marvier of the Environmental Studies Institute of Santa Clara University (USA) illuminates the reasons for conflicting study results and new approaches on how to manage such uncertainties and to improve the significance of biosafety research results. She is promoting large open-access databases for biosafety studies and the application of meta-analyses using the results of numerous studies to get a statistically more reliable picture of the environmental impact of GM crops.</p>

					<p>A variety of soybean resistant to a devastating Asian rust will soon be widely available in West and Central Africa. The rust, a fungal disease that entered Africa in 1996, can wipe out 80 per cent of infected crops. IITA scientists and the Nigeria's National Cereals Research Institute (NCRI) developed the rust-resistant variety, named <i>TGX 1835-10E</i>. The breakthrough is important because farmers can plant the new variety without applying expensive anti-rust chemicals. NCRI says the seeds will be available to farmers by the start of the new cropping season in 2010.</p>

	The ongoing food crisis in Africa was a major theme at the 13th African Union summit, in Sirte, Libya, on 1-3 July 2009. UN Deputy Secretary-General Asha-Rose Migiro noted that the international community could well afford the extra $6-7 bn in aid needed annually to expand African agriculture. That amount, she said, is &quot;eminently feasible,&quot; especially when compared to the hundreds of billions mobilized by the industrialized countries to counter the global economic downturn. Ms. Rhoda Peace Tumusiime, the African Union's agriculture commissioner, called on member governments to process more farm products at home to generate jobs and incomes and develop integrated agricultural markets. African countries, she said, can also lessen their dependence on imported food by converting the $33 bn they spend annually to import food into rural investments instead.</p>

					<p>Coffee farmers should brace themselves for an outbreak of one of the crop’s most dreaded pests — the coffee berry borer. The pest, also known as Ferrari or Broca, say scientists at the Coffee Research Foundation in Nairobi, has been known to cause heavy infestation of up 96 per cent with serious commercial losses mainly in lower altitude areas. According to an international study (covering Kenya, Colombia, Tanzania and Ethiopia) published on Monday in the Public Science Library by researchers from Germany, the US and the Nairobi-based ICIPE (International Centre for Insect Physiology and Ecology), the coffee berry borer will be able to survive and inflict damage to coffee on higher grounds due to the effects of climate change. To mitigate the predicted coffee loses to the beetle, the ICIPE scientists are calling on farmers to go back to the old ways — plant the crop under tree cover. They suggest that producing coffee under shade provides favourable conditions for the Ferrari’s predators, hence reducing pest populations.</p>

	The ‘famine food’ trees can keep drought-hit communities alive when all other food crops fail, says Miranda Spitteler of TREE AID. She argues that policy makers need to recognise the important role trees play in providing emergency food aid. Communities living in countries most affected by food shortages have long known about the key role that trees can play in reducing the need for food aid. However, smallholder farmers in rural Africa need support to adopt agro-forestry techniques, which boost soil fertility and provide tree food crops to supplement nutrition. Training and support can help villagers earn money from tree products. This approach can increase self sufficiency for both rural communities and national economies. It can increase environmental security, diversify livelihood options and reduce the vulnerability of poor households to climate change and external shocks.</p>

	During a dialogue between universities and agricultural organisations, jointly organised by the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA), CTA and the Association of African Universities in Accra, Ghana 28–31 July 2009, Richard Mkandawire, head of the Comprehensive Agricultural Action Programme (CAADP) at NEPAD said that African tertiary institutions continue to be perceived as ivory towers in many countries. Mkandawire urged African universities to work together through the African Universities Forum Network, and to embrace the CAADP action plan agreed on by African heads of state in 2003. Monty Jones, executive director of FARA, says that the continent will need a US$4.4 billion annual investment to effectively carry out agricultural research and development — almost the double of its current budget.</p>

					<p>Farmers in South Africa have reported an inexplicable failure to seed in three different varieties of corn genetically modified (GM) by the Monsanto Corporation. According to Monsanto, the crop failure occurred due to ‘underfertilization processes in the laboratory’, and has only been a problem in ‘less than 25 percent’ of the seed from the three corn varieties. However, Marian Mayet of the Africa Centre for Biosecurity disputed the company's claims. According to her sources, some farms have experienced crop failures as high as 80 percent. She also expressed doubt over Monsanto's explanation for the problem, laying the blame instead on the GM technologies used to produce the seed.</p>

					<p>This paper, which is published by GFAR, gives a detailed explanation of past and current trends in funding of agricultural research and analyzes various agricultural research funding mechanisms that have been used in the past and should be explored today in order to increase agricultural research outputs in developing countries.vBecause underfunding threatens the survival of agricultural research systems in many developing countries, policymakers and development assistance agencies must find alternative institutional mechanisms for sustained financing. Some such alternative mechanisms include: joint public-private sector ventures, sale of research products, competitive funds, research foundations, farmer managed levies on production, and greater involvement of universities and private sector research. While exploring the potential of these alternative funding mechanisms is very important, another part of the solution is to create better managed and more flexible public sector systems, as the public sector is the greatest source of funding for agricultural research in developing countries. While government financing made up 81% of total funding for agricultural research in developing countries, the growth rate of public spending on agricultural research across the globe (developing and high income countries) has decreased in the past two decades.</p>

					<p>Last July, CTA launched a new e-forum on Geographical indications. This e-forum, managed by the Switzerland-based NGO OriGIn, aims to: 


facilitate the periodical dissemination of key updated information on GIs among ACP stakeholders (producers, researchers, policy-makers, NGOs, etc.) 

facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experience among ACP countries 

provide advice in response to specific questions raised by ACP stakeholders 



The primary beneficiaries of this e-forum are ACP and EU stakeholders who attended the CTA workshop held in Montpellier in March 2009, but also other ACP stakeholders interested in these issues. Every two months, oriGIn prepares a fact sheet or paper on basic issues in the field of GIs (key definitions, legal systems to protect origin products, relevant international treaties, international negotiations, etc.). The online participants and beneficiaries are then able to make comments and ask questions, to which OriGIn provides replies.If you wish to participate in this e-consultation please first register to Dgroups: <a href="http://dgroups.org/?frllvl97/register" target="_blank">http://dgroups.org/?frllvl97/register</a>.For more information on CTA’s activities relating to Product diversification, value adding and market differentiation, <a href="http://www.cta.int/en/About-us/What-we-do/Agricultural-Trade-Programme/Main-areas-of-work/Product-diversification-value-adding-and-market-differentiation" target="_blank">please visit our website</a>. </p>

	The Gender and Diversity Programme helps the CGIAR Centers leverage their rich staff diversity to increase research and management excellence. US Secretary of State HIllary Clinton visited its AWARD project for African Women in Agricultural Research and Development, in Nairobi of 5 August 2009. She emphasized the importance of women in agriculture saying ‘The AWARD program is a great example. It supports women scientists working to improve farming here in Africa and to fight hunger and poverty. And we need women represented in our laboratories as well as our fields. And I really congratulate the AWARD women for being pioneers in plant science.’ <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/08/126911.htm" target="_self">Transcript of Clinton's speech</a>.</p>
