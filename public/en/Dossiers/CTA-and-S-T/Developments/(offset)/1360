						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>With experts in agreement that the world’s dry areas will be hardest hit by climate change, scientists from across the globe will meet in Amman, Jordan, on February 1-4 to draft a joint declaration calling for urgent action to buffer dryland agriculture. The declaration will be one of the main outputs of the <a href="http://www.icarda.org/Announcement/2009/IntlConfrnc_FoodSecurity/FoodSecurityAndClimateChangeInDryAreas_2009.htm" target="_blank">International Conference on Food Security and Climate Change in Dry Areas</a>. Agricultural development in dry areas, which account for about a fourth of earth’s total land area and a third of its population, is thwarted by high temperatures, frequent drought, severe land degradation, or desertification, and by water scarcity. Climate change is making all of these problems worse. To address the threat requires broad research programs that cover water management, the development of stress-tolerant crops varieties, diversification of farming systems through the introduction of high-value crops, better insect and disease management, and active promotion of conservation agriculture, which raises productivity while protecting the soil and conserving moisture.

					<p>Four rapidly developing countries — Brazil, South Africa, India and China (known as BASIC) — have vowed to boost climate science cooperation among themselves and other developing countries. The countries will develop a framework for permanent scientific cooperation on climate change and extend technological support to other developing nations, especially least developed countries (LDCs), in areas such as forestry and adaptation. The BASIC group is yet to decide how much it will give LDCs, though Carlos Minc, Brazil's environment minister, estimated the total would exceed the US$10 billion pledged by rich countries. The nations are exploring ways to extend technical support in their own scientific strengths. (Source: Africa the good news, 25 January 2010) </p>

					<p>Thousands of herders in arid areas of northern Kenya will soon be able to buy livestock insurance, based on a first-of-its-kind program in Africa. The program was announced on January 22 in northern Kenya’s Marsabit District by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), microfinance pioneer Equity Bank and African insurance provider UAP Insurance Ltd. Insuring the livestock of pastoralist families has long been considered impossible because of the difficulty of verifying deaths of animals, which move over vast tracts of land in search of food. ILRI and its partners have overcome this impediment by combining the use of satellite images of vegetation with monthly surveys of livestock deaths to pinpoint the level of forage reduction that will cause animals to die.

	Scientists baffled by the continued spread of sleeping sickness through Uganda have discovered that it is livestock markets that are driving the disease. A team from Uganda and the United Kingdom analysed the incidence of the serious Rhodesian form of sleeping sickness, which is carried by cattle, in two newly affected districts. The team looked at nearly 700 villages in the two districts. The research shows that livestock markets are a major risk to disease control. The scientists calculated the vulnerability of a village to sleeping sickness by mapping how close it was to various risk factors such as areas where tsetse flies — which transmit the disease — are likely to live. The research was published in <a href="http://www.plosntds.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0000563" target="_blank">PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases</a> (Source: All Africa, 22 January 2010)</p>

A South African community challenged German homeopathic giant Schwabe Pharmaceuticals in court in Munich at the end of January over a traditional medicine the company is seeking to patent. The case could set a precedent in cases in which multinationals use the plants and indigenous knowledge of developing countries, where laws may not protect communities' intellectual property rights. Schwabe wants to patent a method for producing extracts from the roots of <i>Pelargonium sidoides </i>and <i>Pelargonium reniforme</i> to make cough and cold syrups. The company has also hit problems in India over alleged bioprospecting.The community, in Alice in the Eastern Cape, said the extraction method has been used for generations by traditional healers and Schwabe has no right to patent it.

					<p>Understanding how carbon dioxide impacts food quality is vital to tackle malnutrition effectively, says agricultural researcher Lewis Ziska. Researchers are focusing much attention on how to adapt agriculture to ensure steady food supplies in the face of climate change. But it is equally important to preserve the quality of these supplies as well as the quantity. Researchers, policymakers and the public are increasingly aware that climate uncertainty — characterised by shifting rainfall patterns, increased desertification and warming temperatures — threatens to decrease people's ability to grow food sustainably in many parts of the developing world. But few know that rising levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) — the principal greenhouse gas — is also expected to affect the nutritional value of many basic food crops.

					<p>Disappointed by the ‘failure’ of the Copenhagen talks to adequately help poor countries adapt to climate change, the Burkina Faso government and farmers are working to adjust farming techniques to changing weather patterns. ‘Despite the failure of Copenhagen we must follow adaptation at our own cost because we have been experiencing the impacts of climate change in Burkina for several years, and they are getting worse,’ Bassiaka Dao, confederation of farmers in Burkina Faso (CPF) president, told IRIN. A key agriculture activity is to extend traditional soil protection techniques, said Dao. Methods include digging “Zai” pits – compost-filled planting pits which hold water, helping deep-rooted vegetables grow; building up grass and rock barriers around crops to protect them from soil erosion; and cultivating manure in septic tanks to use as fertilizer.

					<p>In this article, Jim Kaput explains why efforts to tackle malnutrition should consider nutrigenomics — the interplay between food and genetic make-up. Starving people do not just need food. They need the right nutrients to maintain and promote good health. Food aid can help prevent starvation but if it is not nutritionally balanced it could also contribute to chronic diseases and premature death. A person's genes determine how their body absorbs and uses nutrients. Because each person is genetically unique, the amounts and types of nutrients needed to maintain good health may differ among individuals. (Source: SciDev.net, Jim Kaput, 20 January 2010)</p>

					<p>One month after the Copenhagen climate change summit which failed to live up to the expectations of many developing nations including Nigeria, indications are rife that the increasing level of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere pose serious danger to some staples like cassava on which millions of African people depend. Recent studies by Australian scientists have shown that the crops become more toxic and produce smaller yields in environments with higher carbon dioxide levels and more droughts.The findings underscored the need to develop climate-change-resistant cultivars to feed rapidly growing human populations, said Ros Gleadow of the Monash University in Melbourne.

Soybean is a major source of protein for food and animal feed: from tofu to soy flour, meat substitute and soy milk. It is also used to produce much of the world's cooking oil and as an important source for biodiesel. Like other legumes, the crop is also crucial for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen into the soil. &quot;This is a milestone for soybean research and promises to usher in a new era in soybean agronomic improvement,&quot; said co-author Gary Stacey. &quot;The genome provides a parts list of what it takes to make a soybean plant and, more importantly, helps to identify those genes that are essential for such important agronomic traits as protein and oil content.&quot; (Source: Nature, 14 January 2010).</p>

					<p>Podcasts are helping people progress from subsistence farming in Zimbabwe, says Practical Action researcher Lawrence Gudza. The podcasts are in local languages, recorded by members of local communities. Podcasting has yet to take off in most of the developing world because of poor communications and electricity infrastructure. But a pilot project in Zimbabwe, run by the development charity Practical Action, shows that it can work for poor farmers, despite these barriers. The project has improved access to knowledge because the whole community can understand the language and people do not need to be literate to access it. Further, the information combines local and scientific knowledge, is available on demand and is unaffected by events such as flooding, or poor communications infrastructure.

					<p>A new research project mapping the genetic sequence of the sunflower family, which includes many important food crops, is aiming to promote sustainable agriculture, particularly in drier areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. The project — mainly funded by Genome Canada — will locate the genes responsible for specific traits such as seed-oil content and wood producing-capacity, offering scientists a means to develop drought-resistant traits in the crop.

	The UN has launched the International Year of Biodiversity, warning that the ongoing loss of species around the world is affecting human well-being. Eight years ago, governments pledged to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010, but the pledge will not be met. The expansion of human cities, farming and infrastructure is the main reason. German premier Angela Merkel backed the idea of forming a scientific panel to collate and assess research on biodiversity loss, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assesses evidence on climatic indicators. &quot;The question of preserving biological diversity is on the same scale as climate protection,&quot; she said.

	The ‘Green belt’ programme seeks to make Malawi independent of rain-fed agriculture. The plan is to protect the gains in food security, reduce vulnerability to drought and to boost production still further by irrigating a million hectares of land in a swathe lying within 20 kilometres of the country’s three lakes and 13 perennial rivers. The plan will also attempt to diversify crops, targeting increased production of wheat, rice, millet, cotton, lentils and beans for export. Local agriculture experts explain that two districts in the southern tip of the country could feed the entire country all year round if the Shire River, which cuts through the length of this southern plain, was utilised for intensive irrigation farming.
