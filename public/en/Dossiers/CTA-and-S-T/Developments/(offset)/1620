						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>An online electronic atlas has been launched by FAO that provides detailed research data and information on global livestock production and health statistics. The Global Livestock Production and Health Atlas (GLiPHA) offers users the unique opportunity to view sub-national statistics relating to the livestock sector, which can be viewed cartographically, against a back-drop of selected maps, such as livestock densities, land-use and topography. Data may also be displayed and exported as tables and charts. The objectives of GLiPHA are to facilitate access to livestock sector information for analysis and informed decision making, and to increase awareness of sector-related social, health and environmental issues. GLiPHA draws on data managed within the Global Livestock Impact Mapping (GLIMS) – a global, sub-national data warehouse containing a multitude of livestock-sector related information.</p>

Botswana International University of Science and Technology will focus on engineering, mining, geology and basic sciences. Later plans include a research park. The university grew out of recommendations in a critical <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/nationalreports/africa/botswana/Botswana_2005_en.pdf" target="_blank">2005 UN Development Programme (UNDP) report</a> that called for increased funding for university-level scientific research in Botswana.

					<p>Scientists have for the first time genetically modified white corn to increase the levels of several different vitamins - bringing closer the prospect of crops that can deliver full nutritional requirements. The team increased the levels of beta-carotene, the precursor of vitamin A 170-fold; levels of vitamin C six-fold and also doubled the folic acid in the African staple. White corn normally contains only trace amounts of beta-carotene. Diseases caused by low consumption of vitamin A, vitamin C and folate are widespread in Africa, says lead researcher Paul Christou of the University of Lleida in Spain. His team developed a method that transfers the desired genes into plant embryos by bombarding them with gene-coated metal particles. The resulting plants are then screened for those containing the required genes. The method can introduce an unlimited number of transgenes into any plant, says Christou. The method is quicker than others and the genes persist in subsequent generations. They aim to have prototype plants containing 25-30 transgenes in five years, but getting them past GM regulatory processes and into the field will be the difficult part, say Christou.

Biofuel crops are more likely than other plants to become invasive in tropical and subtropical ecosystems worldwide, scientists have found. They say that a weed risk assessment (WRA) , which examines a plant's biology, geographic origin, known pest status and behaviour, can be used to predict whether a species of biofuel crop will become invasive, enabling countries to avoid environmental and economic losses. They found that biofuel crops are two to four times more likely to be invasive or to establish wild populations than a random sample of other plants introduced to Hawaii. The team concludes that extensive planting — a scenario expected with large-scale biofuel crop cultivation — will aggravate invasions. 
They claim these results are valid for all areas with tropical and subtropical ecosystems.

Thanks to new agreements signed by Google, the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA) and the Tropical Agriculture Research and Higher Education Center (CATIE), people around the world are <a href="http://orton.catie.ac.cr/defaulten.htm" target="_blank">just a click away</a> from accessing nearly 9000 books on agriculture. And the figure is set to rise to over 20,000 books in the near future. The texts form part of the collections of the Venezuela Library, at IICA Headquarters, and the Orton Commemorative Library, located on the campus of CATIE. Both are situated in Costa Rica.The two organizations view agriculture, rural life and the management and conservation of the natural resources of the Americas as forming part of a global context characterized by globalization and trade liberalization processes that have created opportunities and thrown up challenges for all the actors involved. For that reason, they believe it is essential - given the crisis in food prices, the global financial crisis and the uncertainty created by climate change - to spread knowledge by means of dissemination processes such as the one made possible by this partnership.</p>

					<p>The first ever meeting between agriculture ministers from the world's eight most industrialised nations (G8) called for more public and private investment in sustainable farming to boost food supplies and ensure global food security. The meeting took place in Italy on 18-20 April 2009. G8 agriculture ministers called for more food to be grown to feed the world's hungry, given the lack of progress in tackling poverty and problems in balancing food supply with demand. The ministers said public and private investment in sustainable farming and rural development need to be increased, and called for increased support including investments in agricultural science, research, technology, education, extension services and innovation. The ministers denounced the 'food protectionism' exercised by rich and poor countries alike in the form of export bans and import duties in farming, and stressed the importance of a rules-based international system for farm trade. About price volatility the G8 farm ministers’ statement said that &quot;there should be monitoring and further analysis of factors potentially affecting price volatility in commodity markets, including speculation&quot;. The ministers also outlined the merits of buffer grain stocks as an emergency food facility to ease price shocks and curb speculative commodity trading, and said they would ask international organisations to examine the &quot;feasibility and administrative modalities&quot; of a common stockholding system. The statement does not refer to the sensitive issue of 'land-grabbing', i.e. the growing trend for governments to invest in farm projects beyond their borders.

					<p>Scientists of the African Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF), Kenya, the United States Department for Agriculture (USDA) and International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, IITA, Nigeria, have developed a safe and natural method that could drastically cut aflatoxin contamination in African food crops by as much as 99 per cent. Under the biocontrol method, native strains of Aspergillus flavus that do not produce aflatoxins (called atoxigenic strains) can be applied in order to alter the fungal community on crops and throughout an area so that maize becomes less contaminated with aflatoxins. Farmers, policy makers, the food and feed industry and various NGOs have expressed their desire and support to convert this technology into a readily-available product in Nigeria and other countries in Africa.

					<p>Scientists have engineered vitamin-fortified corn designed to boost consumption of three key nutrients that are sorely lacking in the diets of millions of people in developing countries, according to a study published on April 28. The genetically modified African corn has bright orange kernels, reflecting the 169-fold increase in beta carotene, a precursor of vitamin A. The corn also has six times the normal amount of vitamin C and double the usual level of folate, researchers reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. But most of the target countries in Africa don't have systems in place to evaluate and approve genetically modified crops, and several countries have banned them.

					<p>The Nairobi-based Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), in partnership with the African Agricultural Capital (AAC) group, recently launched the African Seed Investment Fund (ASIF) in Kampala. Over the next five years, it will invest in at least 20 small- and medium-size seed companies in Southern and Eastern Africa, infusing equity and expertise into an industry that has languished for decades, and paving the way for raising the productivity and incomes of at least one million farm households. “The sole purpose of ASIF is to provide high quality seeds to smallholder African farmers, thereby improving income and quality of life,” said Dr. Namanga Ngongi, President of AGRA. ASIF will fill a critical funding gap in African agricultural development—financing for its seriously underdeveloped and undercapitalized seed sector. Across Southern and Eastern Africa there are over 50 small- and medium-sized African seed companies, compared to hundreds that operate in Europe or in the United States.

					<p>Food security and income for millions of people in Kenya, DR Congo, Rwanda, Tanzania and Burundi face great threat from the deadly banana wilt disease, according to a study published in the May issue of the Plant Disease Journal, which is published by the American Phytopathological Society. The study, entitled Xanthomonas Wilt – A threat to Banana Production in East and Central Africa, was jointly undertaken by researchers at IITA and Uganda’s National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO).
