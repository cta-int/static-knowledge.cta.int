						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	This paper by K. Graham and R. Vignola (from the Overseas Development Institute, ODI) outlines the linkages between forests and agriculture, and the need for national level REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, with the + referring to forest conservation, sustainable forest management and carbon stock enhancement) policies and programmes to effectively address agriculture as a driver of deforestation and forest degradation, and ensure that local level food security is not compromised. It examines a number of policy approaches (that may form part of a REDD+ strategy) to address deforestation and forest degradation caused by the expansion of agriculture. The agriculture sector and forests are intrinsically linked, most obviously through their direct competition for land. The authors argue that to harmonise agricultural and REDD+ policy goals, agricultural intensification will be necessary, but not sufficient. They believe that in the absence of other policy and regulatory measures to reduce deforestation, intensification is very unlikely to reduce pressure on forests, and most likely only large scale land use planning will be essential in identifying areas for specific “place based” policies to support REDD+ objectives.  The paper discusses the potential policy options as well as some potential socio-economic impacts (for subsistence as well as commercial farmers) and how policy design and targeted REDD+ revenues can be used to mitigate them.(<a href="http://redd-net.org/files/REDD%20and%20agriculture%20laid%20up.pdf" target="_blank">REDD-net.org</a>, August 2011) </p>

	A <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/108/33/13432" target="_blank">new study</a> conducted by Mauricio Bellon, Programme Director at Bioversity International, and colleagues, throws light on the ways that smallholder famers will be able to obtain seeds that will cope with climate change. The team surveyed Mexican maize farmers in four different agro-ecological zones to find out where the farmers got their seed and then modelled how variation in regional climate might affect their environment. For all communities except those in the highlands, predicted future maize environments are already represented within the 10-km radial zones, indicating that in the future farmers will have easy access to adapted planting material. Farmers in the highlands are the most vulnerable and probably will need to acquire seed from outside their traditional geographical ranges. This change in seed sources probably will entail important information costs and the development of new seed and associated social networks, including improved linkages between traditional and formal seed systems and more effective and efficient seed-supply chains. The approach pioneered in this research, of integrating information about seed systems with fine-scale examination of predicted climate shifts, is important because it has the potential to be applied in other regions and countries.

	A new research programme led by European research institutions with funding from the European Commission will help to define a policy for sustainable management of soils, with a view to adopting a legally binding Soil Framework Directive, such as exists for air and water. The Ecological Function and Biodiversity Indicators in European Soils (EcoFINDERS) programme, which launched in January 2011, brings together 22 institutional European research partners, including the University of Cambridge, to formulate how best to manage the health of soil. The goal of EcoFINDERS is to design and implement soil strategies aimed at ensuring the sustainable use of soils.

	This ODI Briefing Paper calls for a fresh look at the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy alongside development goals and the new global context. The CAP has the potential to affect developing countries in a variety of ways. The EU has recognised that making development policy in isolation is not sufficient. Its commitment to Policy Coherence for Development seeks to ensure that all policies, not only development assistance, promote growth in developing countries. This briefing paper analyses CAP reform options against development goals and finds that research is urgently needed to analyse the coherence between the reforms and European development policy.

	In 2010, UNESCO´s Regional Bureau for Science in Latin America and the Caribbean, based in Montevideo (Uruguay), developed a pilot methodology for the standardization and systematization of data on science, technology and innovation (STI) policies in the 33 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, together with a sophisticated information platform known as the Science Policy Information Network (SPIN). This platform is a cluster of databases equipped with powerful graphic and analytical tools that has been devised for political leaders, planners, directors and administrators of science and technology in parliaments, universities, research institutions, production enterprises concerned with innovation, international organisations; and researchers and other specialists whose field of study embraces science and technology policies. UNESCO has plans to turn SPIN into a global observatory, starting with Africa, the Arab States, Asia and the Pacific. In parallel, UNESCO is preparing a proposal to standardize and normalize the way in which the surveys and information about operational STI policy instruments are produced around the world. This work will culminate in the Paris Manual. A group of well-known international experts and STI decision-makers are meeting in Paris on 19-20 October 2011 at UNESCO’s invitation to take this process forward.

					<p>In <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/sparing-or-sharing-protecting-wild-species-may-require-growing-more-food-on-less-land/" target="_blank">the study</a> 'Reconciling food production and biodiversity conservation: land sharing and land sparing compared', Dr Ben Phalan and research colleagues from the University of Cambridge and Royal Society for the Protection of Birds discovered that, under current and future scenarios of food demand, most species would have larger total populations if farming was restricted to the smallest area feasible, while protecting as much natural forest as possible. This was true not just for rare species but for common species as well. This strategy, called ‘land sparing’, uses higher yields on existing farmland to spare land for nature (in contrast with ‘land sharing’, which aims to conserve wild species and grow crops on the same land). Because high-yield farming produced more food from less land, it could be used as part of a strategy to protect larger tracts of natural habitats such as forest.

					<p>A new Global Soil Partnership for Food security and Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation has been launched by the FAO early September 2011. Besides helping implement the provisions of the World Soil Charter, the Global Soil Partnership is intended to raise awareness and motivate action by decision-makers on the importance of soils for food security and climate change adaptation and mitigation. The partnership is also aimed at providing favourable policy environment and technical solutions for soil protection and management and at helping mobilize resources and expertise for joint activities and programmes. The Global Soil Partnership will complement the 15-year-old Global Water Partnership initiated by the UNDP and the World Bank in 1996 to coordinate the development and management of water, land, and related resources in order to maximise economic and social welfare without compromising the sustainability of vital environmental systems.(<a href="http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/89277/icode/" target="_blank">FAO</a>, 7/9/2011)</p>

					<p>&nbsp;A South Asia Pro-Poor Livestock Policy Programme, a joint initiative of the National Dairy Development Board of India and the FAO, has identified and documented a range of good practices along the poultry supply chain in Bangladesh, Bhutan and India, an agricultural sub-sector of great importance for most ACP countries. These include interventions related to the provision of inputs, management and improved husbandry practices, health service delivery and the marketing of live birds and eggs. This paper reviews and draws lessons out of 11 good practices on small‐scale poultry farming, documented by the programme in collaboration with a variety of public and private actors. The document attempts to identify gaps in the relevant policy and institutional framework to enable improvements in smallholder poultry rearing.

	<a href="http://teca.fao.org/home%20" target="_blank">TECA</a> is a platform where small producers can find practical information – agricultural technologies and practices – to help them in the field. Using TECA, they can interact with people with similar interests and discuss sustainable solutions for their work in the online forums (‘Exchange Groups’). Users can find technologies and practices in crop production, forestry, livestock, fisheries, marketing and more. TECA technologies are tested and/or adopted by small producers, easy to replicate, expected to increase production in a sustainable way. Some of them can also help to adapt to climate change. For example, TECA's category for Climate change and disaster risk reduction features crop rotation techniques, hurricane-resistant poultry pen design, strip cropping and grass barriers practices.

	The excessive use of irrigation water has resulted in serious environmental concerns in many dry-land countries, where rising demand has deteriorated groundwater resources, depleted aquifers, and accelerated saltwater intrusion. Scientists in Spain are working on new technologies to classify and monitor irrigated crops with a goal of promoting sustainable agricultural practices. The field studies the researchers designed were to evaluate the potential of multispectral reflectance and seven vegetation indices in the visible and near-infrared spectral range for discriminating and classifying bare soil and several horticultural irrigated crops. The research is the first step of a broader project with the overall goal of using satellite imagery with high spatial and multispectral resolutions for mapping irrigated crops.

A number of factors have been identified as being responsible for the lack of or limited growth of PNG’s agricultural growth (except for one or two sub-sector) and James Laraki of PNG’s National Agricultural Research Institute believes poor agricultural extension has been one of the significant factors. According to the author writing on Malum Nalu’s weblog, the dismal performance of extension began with the decentralisation of extension services from the National Department of Agriculture and Livestock (NDAL) to the provinces soon after independence. This created 19 extension systems without any plans and adequate resources. This followed with the creation of commodity boards and proliferation of NGOs, church-based extension services and other service providers, all with varied plans and client base. This resulted in extension services becoming very fragmented, with most of the providers working on ad-hoc basis. A new policy on agriculture extension system is required to focus on the development of an effective and efficient extension system. (<a href="http://malumnalu.blogspot.com/2011/08/agriculture-extension-system-needs.html" target="_blank">Malum Nalu</a>, 1/8/2011) Earlier in 2011, Laraki and colleague wrote an article on PNG’s potential for aquaculture development.

	For fruits, cereals and leguminous plants such as oranges, wheat, beans and olives to grow in hot and dry climates, they must be irrigated regularly. And very often the water used comes from deep wells. In Egypt, many farmers currently use diesel generators to water their fields. A model project in Upper Egypt shows that other methods are possible. Here, a photovoltaic stand-alone system takes care of irrigating a wheat field. Concentrator photovoltaic system (CPV) modules – which, due to their higher degree of effectiveness and their particular construction, require far less space than traditional PV modules – supply the energy, while Fresnel lenses concentrate the rays of the sun onto pinhead-sized multi-junction solar cells. With the aid of a tracking motor, the CPV cells, which are attached to a pillar, follow the sun precisely to achieve an optimized yield of solar light. They supply the energy for a submersible pump that pumps the water up from a well that is 105 feet deep and for a small desalination unit that satisfies farmers’ potable water requirements. The CPV cells also supply the energy for PV-module trackers, the monitoring and control system and an air-conditioning unit that cools the utility room of the facility.(<a href="http://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2010-2011/20/solar-power-management.jsp" target="_blank">Frauenhofer-Gesellschaft</a> via <a href="http://www.alphagalileo.org/ViewItem.aspx?ItemId=109523&amp;CultureCode=en" target="_blank">AlphaGalileo</a>, 2/8/2011)</p>

	Breeding crops with deeper roots could significantly reduce atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide and make crops more drought resistant, according to a research <a href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/news/display/?id=7296" target="_blank">study</a> conducted at the University of Manchester. Reporting in the journal, Annals of Botany, professor Douglas Kell calculated that breeding crops whose roots extend 2 meters underground, rather than the 1-meter roots common to many crops, could double the amount of carbon captured from the atmosphere. In principle, any crop could be treated in this way, giving more productive yields while also being better for the environment. Kell reported that creating crops and plants with deeper and bushier roots would also lead to more water and nutrient retention and produce more sustainable plant yields as the world warms and droughts increase in water-stressed regions.

	The World Resources Institute’s (WRI) Coastal Capital series was launched in 2005 and aims to provide decision-makers in the Caribbean with information and tools that link the health of coastal ecosystems with the attainment of economic and social goals. WRI and its local partners have conducted economic valuation studies of coral reefs and mangroves at national and subnational levels in five countries: Trinidad and Tobago, St. Lucia, Belize, the Dominican Republic and, in June 2011, Jamaica. WRI has published (June 2011) a Working Paper on the coastal capital of <a href="http://www.wri.org/publication/coastal-capital-jamaica" target="_blank">Jamaica</a> with an interesting <a href="http://www.wri.org/stories/2011/06/jamaicas-coastal-capital-risk-report-field" target="_blank">field report</a>. The paper offers a detailed evaluation of the contribution of coral reefs to the Jamaican economy, as well as the benefits that will be lost if coral reefs degrade further.
