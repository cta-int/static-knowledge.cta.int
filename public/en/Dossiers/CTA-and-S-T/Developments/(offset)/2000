						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>For more than a decade now, the Philippines-based International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has struggled with declining funding as the world thought it had won the war on food security. The institute, which launched the Green Revolution in the 1960s that more than doubled global rice harvest, has faced a steady drop in its funding since the mid-1990s. The crunch curtailed IRRI’s work on areas that needed to be studied to ensure that rice production kept up with the world’s growing population, climate change and other barriers to sustainable agriculture. But there is an upbeat mood in the cash-strapped IRRI now as it looks forward to fresh funding in the wake of a rice crisis that continues to burden billions of people who rely on the grain as their staple food. IRRI Director General Robert Zeigler said the rice crisis has revitalized interest in agricultural investment and the institute’s work (Source: by Indo-Asian News Service, 17 July, 2008).</p>

					<p>This year certainly is the time for the big guns to affirm the importance of agriculture in development. First came the World Bank's World Development Report 2008, which cast agriculture as a major tool for reducing poverty. It was the first time in over two decades that the organisation had ranked farming so highly. Next, the International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) made a similar call, encouraging a nuanced approach to agricultural research and practice. Now the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) has joined the growing chorus, issuing its own &quot;roadmap&quot; for development, which champions the importance of innovation and the pressing need to make scientific research relevant to farmers (Source: by Ochieng' Ogodo, The New Agriculturist, July 2008).</p>

					<p>Europe's system of agricultural support should not be emulated in other regions of the world grappling with high food prices, the top United Nations official for humanitarian affairs has suggested. Earlier this year, Michel Barnier, the French agriculture minister, stated that the original rationale behind the European Union's common agricultural policy (CAP) was to ensure self-sufficiency in food and that this could serve as a &quot;good model&quot; for developing similar ways of protecting farming in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Barnier's comments have been followed by bickering over agriculture in recent weeks between France and the European Commission, the EU executive (Source: by David Cronin, IPS, 7 July 2008).</p>

					<p>Scientists have determined how to fortify the cassava plant, a staple root crop in many developing countries, with enough vitamins, minerals and protein to provide the poor and malnourished with a day’s worth of nutrition in a single meal. The researchers have further engineered the cassava plant so it can resist the crop’s most damaging viral threats and are refining methods to reduce cyanogens, substances that yield poisonous cyanide if they are not properly removed from the food before consumption. The reduction of cyanogens also can shorten the time it takes to process the plant into food, which typically requires three to six days to complete (Source: Research News, 30 June 2008).</p>

					<p>In an interview with EurActiv, Guy Riba, the deputy director of the French national institute for agricultural research (INRA), highlights the many challenges the world will have to meet by 2050 if it wants to feed its nine-billion inhabitants without destroying its environment. He spoke to EurActiv ahead of a major conference by the French Presidency today (3 July) in Parliament. Riba highlights a number of puzzling challenges facing policymakers across the world when dealing with growing strains on food supplies amid a global population explosion, among which land use competition between urban and rural areas, adaptation to climate change – in particular water resources – and ensuring sufficient food at reasonable prices without endangering the environment (Source: EurActiv, 3 July 2008).</p>

					<p>Oil palm is a new cash crop being re-introduced in Africa, and Uganda has taken the lead in the region, through a project that has not only started changing the livelihoods of people on the Islands, but also to rehabilitate the deforested land, due to human activities around lake Victoria. On the commercial scene, East African countries will soon cut down on the money spent each year on importing vegetable oil through the Kenyan port of Mombasa as Uganda starts local harvest of fresh fruits of palm oil in June next year. Palm oil is an important vegetable oil rich in vitamins. It is also used in industries for soap production and other olio chemicals. The oil palm project being run by BIDCO oil refineries started in 2003 and so far 588 farmers are supplementing the production as out growers. The project has for the last two years faced several criticisms from politicians and environmentalists (Source: by Pius Sawa, Africa Science News Service, 4 July 2008). </p>

					<p>For the first time in living memory, Caribbean governments invested time and large sums of money to organise an emergency food summit at their trade bloc's headquarters in Guyana aimed specifically at dealing with the global food crisis and the region's spiraling import bill. The good news is there is an abundance of rich but uncultivated land in the area ranging from Belize in Central America to Suriname on the South American mainland. The two-day regional agricultural investment forum earlier this month was hailed as a resounding success, if only because authorities were able to bring together, in one room, commercial bankers, two heads of government, cabinet ministers, farmers and representatives from multilateral institutions like the World Bank to focus on a single topic -- the need to produce more food in the Caribbean (Source: by Bert Wilkinson, IPS, Gyanana, 20 June 2008). </p>

					<p> Poor yields in farming can be blamed on imbalance of traditional and modern farming methods. According to Chido Makunike, a Zimbabwean researcher currently based in Senegal, farmers need to be informed on the importance of mixing both traditional and modern technologies to better yield hence prevent hunger. According to Mr. Makunike, foreign ideologies and innovations that are not modified to meet the local’s demands are of no help at all. Depending on many local variables, new ways of farming that take into account the farming and other social aspects of local life have the best prospects of bringing about long-lasting change. Furthermore, it has been proven by science that traditional methods of farming that are seen to be backward and not helpful in this day and age still do have their own benefits. Makunike noted that farmers do not have control over prices but have control over traditional techniques and therefore, for the kinds of farming practiced by most of Africa’s smallholders, and taking into account the economic environment in which they operate, those who are able to find a good mix of traditional and modern methods have considerable advantages over those who are stuck with one or the other type of farming.

					<p> The problems caused by the misuse of chemical insecticides have driven scientists, policy makers including donors and development institutions to promote the production of biological cotton in northern Benin. According to a report from a research project funded by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), and presented at a conference for smallholder farmers in Nairobi that farmers’ perceptions and willingness to pay for a biopesticide developed from Metarhizium anisopliae a fungi have increased. Both organic and conventional cotton producers have expressed a significant interest in the use of Metarhizium to control Helicoverpa on cotton. Until recently, the available pest control method was many sprays of chemical insecticides against a variety of insect pest species that attack cotton (aphids, bugs, whiteflies and mites). Today this biopesticide represents about 2.5% of the overall pesticide market, and is expected to grow to about 4.2% by 2010. Source: Nyambati M.

EU leaders endorsed the plans to review the complex system of approving GM licences, which is split between the EU and national governments. It could be streamlined to make the approval process easier. Plans by the Commission to give &quot;pre-marketing authorisation&quot; to 16 GMOs have been blocked by the Council of Ministers, which is the EU's main decision-making body. The Commission has urged member states with national bans on GM crops to lift them, saying that they are not &quot;scientifically justified&quot;.

Coastal Capital: Economic Valuation of Coral Reefs in Tobago and St. Lucia highlights the results from the economic valuation of coral reefs in St. Lucia and Tobago -- sites with very different coastal management and data richness situations -- and features several maps illustrating the findings.

					<p> Records indicate that Gambians consume far more quantity of rice than what is produced at home. This, apparently, has warranted the profit-minded business people to always take advantage. And over the years, Africans have become addicted to imported rice that became ignorant of the implications of discounting home grown varieties. This is unacceptable for a country like The Gambia, given its aptness for agricultural productivity. The problem, certainly, has no bearing with environmental requirement, nor is it connected to the availability of labour. If we would blame it on any thing, it could only be attitude. Research activities need to be carried out to establish more products that can be gotten from some of the crops that do well in The Gambia, like millet, sorghum, etc. Source: African Science News Service, Gambia, 22 June 2008.</p>

					<p> Experts say that during the food surpluses of recent decades, governments and development agencies lost focus on the importance of helping poor countries improve their agriculture. Vital research programs have been slashed. At the rice institute, scientists have identified 14 genetic traits that could help rice plants survive the plant hopper, which sucks the juices out of young plants while infecting them with viruses. But the scientists have had no money to breed these traits into the world's most widely used rice varieties. Similar troubles plague other centres in Asia, Africa and Latin America that work on crop productivity in poor countries. Agricultural experts have complained about the flagging efforts for years and warned of the risks. Crop by crop and country by country, agricultural research and development are lagging. The biggest cutbacks have come in donations to agriculture in poor countries from the governments of wealthy countries and in loans from development institutions that the wealthy governments control, like the World Bank. Such projects include not only research on pests and crops but also programs to help farmers adopt improved methods in their fields.
