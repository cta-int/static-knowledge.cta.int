						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>The ECOWAS Commissioner for Agriculture, Environment and Water Resources, Dr Marc Atouga, called on Member States to harmonize their policies and efforts in the fisheries sector to boost intra-regional trade in fish products. Addressing the opening of a five-day inaugural meeting of the Regional Fisheries Committee on the Coherence of Policies in the Fishery Industry in the ECOWAS Region, on 27 August 2012 in Cotonou, Benin, Dr Atouga noted that constraints in the sector included inadequate transport infrastructure and challenges posed by antiquated customs rules.(<a href="http://africanbrains.net/2012/08/29/ecowas-urges-policy-harmonization-for-fisheries-development/ " target="_blank">AfricaBrains</a>, 29/8/20112)</p>

					<p>During the 2nd African Organic Conference held in Lusaka, Zambia 2-4 May 2012 on the theme ‘Mainstreaming Organic Agriculture in the African Development Agenda’ participants agreed that organic agriculture is becoming a key component of sustainable development. Research has shown that the adoption of organic agriculture practices significantly increases yields and food security and makes producers less vulnerable to international input price volatility, and promotes environmental sustainability, among other benefits. In this regard, a declaration adopted at the conference welcomed the institutionalisation of AfroNet (African Organic Network), the umbrella organisation uniting and representing African organic stakeholders. The declaration calls upon the African Union to mainstream organic agriculture into all areas of its work, including the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP).(Excerpt from <a href="http://ictsd.org/i/agriculture/135315/ " target="_blank">ICTSD</a>, 13/6/2012)&nbsp;</p>

					<p>If sub-Saharan Africa is to benefit from advances in agricultural productivity, investments in the so-called 'orphan crops' – sweet potato, cassava, and millet – will be crucial for strengthening the poorest farmers’ livelihoods and improving nutrition, argues Daniel Bornstein for <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i> (6/8/2012). The author cites the work of the Association for strengthening Agricultural Research in Eastern and Central Africa (ASARECA) and the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) in bringing these orphan crops to the research labs in several African countries, with the farmers’ participation. Markets are vastly underdeveloped for crops such as sweet potato and cassava. Yet these crops’ tremendous value to human nutrition makes it imperative to create local food markets for them. Sub-Saharan Africa has for too long depended on global food markets, leaving the continent vulnerable to high food prices.</p>

					<p>A new four-year research project aims to develop the technologies, processes and expertise to produce high quality veneer and veneer products from senile coconut trees in some Pacific island countries. Forestry departments of Fiji, Samoa and Solomon Islands and several industrial companies in the region are collaborating in the project, which is funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR). This research project is a follow-up of an earlier ACIAR-funded project on improving value and marketability of coconut wood, which aimed at the production of flooring from solid coconut wood for the high quality hardwood flooring market overseas.(Via agro.biodiver.se, 14/8/2012)</p>

					<p>Breadfruit (<i>Artocarpus altilis</i>) is a high-yielding underutilized food-crop that grows in abundance in many tropical nations that struggle with malnutrition, including Haiti, the Philippines and India. It's high in carbohydrates, very high-yielding and requires few agricultural inputs. Because breadfruit has such a short shelf-life, most breadfruit goes uneaten, even in extremely malnourished communities. Compatible Technology International (CTI) has developed a set of manually-operated tools that rural villagers can use to preserve fresh breadfruit as gluten-free flour. The tools include a shredder, dryer and grinder. Breadfruit flour can be used in cookies, cakes, and many other products as a substitute or in addition to wheat flour, which is much more costly. In the fall of 2012, the breadfruit equipment will be thoroughly tested at the <a href="http://ntbg.org/breadfruit/" target="_self">Breadfruit Institute of the National Tropical Botanical Garden</a> in Hawaii. CTI will use the data collected at the Breadfruit Institute and in Haiti (a project using the tool) to help community enterprises form economically viable business models.(Via agro.biodiver.se, 8/2012)</p>

					<p>In biology, an organism's scientific (taxonomic) name is the key to finding information about it. This data – on the genetic, ecological, and agricultural particulars of every known plant – is held in repositories scattered all over the globe, at places as diverse as university labs, museums, and private-sector corporations. Some of the information is hidden within spreadsheets stored on the computers of individual plant scientists. This often results in multiple listings (under different names) of the same species. To tackle the problem and provide a solution, the Taxonomic Name Resolution Service (TNRS, <a href="http://tnrs.iplantcollaborative.org/" target="_self">http://tnrs.iplantcollaborative.org/</a>) was developed by the National Science Foundation (US), US Dept. of Agriculture and other institutions. The latest version of TNRS resolves plant taxonomic names – often lists containing thousands of names – by passing them through a process of exact matching, parsing to break names into their component parts and ‘fuzzy matching’ to search for near matches. Members of the botany community are invited to contact iPlant [<a href="http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/" target="_self">http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/</a>] about contributing their taxonomic sources to the TNRS.(<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-06/cshl-nro060112.php" target="_blank">Eurekalert</a>, 1/6/2012)</p>

					<p>In order to facilitate better collaboration between agricultural research actors and ensure more effective management of research projects and more rational funding, it is desirable to have access to comprehensive information on people's expertise, areas of activities of institutions, existing projects in specific areas and countries, related events and publications. An information system aimed at giving access to such information should: a) go beyond closed communities and directories (search several communities and directories, allow to share people profiles, affiliations, competencies, projects, publications across communities); b) go beyond serendipity, gathering information systematically, organizing data by discipline, affiliation, topic, geographic scope and providing context, in order to discover what is happening and who does what through meaningful relationships. Cornell University, the Global Forum on Agricultural Research and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations are working on an adaptation of the VIVO model (developed in 2003 at Cornell U) for agricultural research, called AgriVIVO. AgriVIVO integrates data from several large agricultural research management communities into a VIVO RDF store, customizing the ontology model to the organization of agricultural research, focusing on the relationships between people, institutions, projects, topics, events, and geographic locations.&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.egfar.org/es/information-gateway/ar4d-information-gateway/agrivivo" target="_blank">GFAR</a>, 2012)</p>

					<p>‘Too Big to Ignore’ is a new research network and knowledge mobilization partnership to promote and revitalize small-scale fisheries in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, and around the world. The first goal of the network is to enhance the understanding of the real contribution of small-scale fisheries to food security, nutrition, sustaining livelihoods, poverty alleviation, wealth generation and trade, as well as the impacts and implications of global change processes such as urbanization, globalization, migration, climate change, aquaculture, and communication technology on small-scale fisheries. The second goal is to create an innovative and interactive web platform, a Small-scale Fisheries Information System (SFIS), for global and local analysis of small-scale fisheries and their contributions to the broader society. Currently, the characteristics of small-scale fisheries are difficult to capture because of the lack of official statistics, even though small-scale fisheries account for about 90% of the 560 million people who depend on fisheries.</p>

					<p>Conservation agriculture (CA) is rapidly developing in Madagascar but little is known about its effects on local soil functioning. To assess some of those effects, the authors investigated the effects of three CA systems and two levels of fertilization on soil functioning using nematofauna as indicator. Conservation farming (CA) effect on soil functioning was studied through nematodes. The authors compared the soil nematodes of three CA to those of tillage (CT) and fallow (NF). They showed that nematodes parameters discriminated well the different systems. The soil functioning of CA system was intermediated between that NF and CT system. The CA systems were able to support better/comparable plant yields compared to CT.</p>

					<p>CTA recently identified a team of consultants to lead a project to review established practice and assess opportunities to improve the reproductive performance of smallholder dairy cows in the context of sub-Saharan Africa. This also includes a technical and economic feasibility of oestrus synchronization in smallholder dairy cows kept under Ethiopian conditions. The lead consultant, Dr Alastair Gavin Paterson, and his assistant Mr. Louis le Roex of Paterson Agri-Services, South Africa were chosen for the assignment. The project includes two lots (Lot A and Lot B).<b>Lot A</b>: <i>Opportunities to improve the reproductive performance of smallholder dairy cows in Africa</i>.<b>Lot B</b>: <i>Technical and Economic Evaluation of Oestrus synchronization in Ethiopia</i>.Professor Arthur Lishman, a top reproductive physiologist in South Africa is also an advisor to the consulting group. Given the extensive knowledge of the team on reproductive physiology and the realities of the dairy sector in Africa, CTA is confident that this project will contribute to improving the performance of smallholder dairy cows and the wider dairy industry in sub-Saharan Africa as well as provide lessons for policy and practice in the wider ACP region.Click the link below to read <a href="/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/Call-for-Tender-and-Terms-of-Reference-Limited-Market-Consultation-Smallholder-Dairy-Consultancy-Deadline-27-July-2012" target="_self">the original call</a>.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Researchers in Germany and Hungary have engineered novel pellets that are able to repel pests in a way that does not harm the environment and that could fertilise the plants. These pellets are made of cyanobacteria and fermentation residues from biogas facilities. The organic farming industry could stand to benefit from this innovative development since organic farmers stand to lose entire crops when pests lay their eggs on freshly planted vegetables.(<a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=EN_NEWS&amp;ACTION=D&amp;DOC=22&amp;CAT=NEWS&amp;QUERY=01389ecc7882:82e7:262c29c6&amp;RCN=34497 " target="_blank">CORDIS</a>, 11/4/2012)</p>

					<p>Food industries are the biggest purchasers of agricultural raw materials. In order to rely on a constant, increasing and safe supply of agricultural raw materials, these must be grown in a sustainable manner. In 2002 Nestlé, Unilever and Danone created the <a href="http://www.saiplatform.org/ " target="_blank">Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) Platform</a>, a non-profit organization to facilitate sharing, at precompetitive level, of knowledge and initiatives to support the development and implementation of sustainable agriculture practices involving the different stakeholders of the food chain. The SAI Platform today counts over 30 members, which actively share the same view on sustainable agriculture seen as a 'productive, competitive and efficient way to produce agricultural products, while at the same time protecting and improving the natural environment and social/economic conditions of local communities'. Among the latest services and deliverables produced, the SAI Platform published <a href="http://www.saiplatform.org/uploads/Library/PPsArableVegetableCrops2009-2.pdf" target="_self"><i>Principles and practices for the sustainable production of arable and vegetable crops</i></a>, Principles and Practices for the sustainable production of <a href="http://www.saiplatform.org/uploads/Library/PPsCoffee2009-2.pdf" target="_self">Coffee</a>, <a href="http://www.saiplatform.org/uploads/Library/PPsFruit2009-2.pdf" target="_self">Fruit</a> and <a href="http://www.saiplatform.org/uploads/Library/PPsDairy2009-2.pdf" target="_self">Dairy</a>; a <i>Benchmark Study of Agriculture Standards</i> and a <a href="http://www.saiplatform.org/uploads/Library/short_guide_to_sa_-_final%5B1%5D.pdf" target="_self"><i>Short Guide to Sustainable Agriculture</i></a>.</p>

					<p>A researcher at Purdue University, the United States, has taken maize off steroids and found that the results might lead to improvements in the crop. Mr. Burkhard Schulz, an assistant professor of horticulture and landscape architecture, wanted to understand the relationship between natural brassinosteroids – a natural plant steroid hormone – and plant architecture, specifically plant height. Mr. Schulz found that when maize loses the ability to produce brassinosteroids, it becomes a dwarf. Another feature, however, caught him off guard: the plants without the naturally occurring steroids could not make male organs – they had kernels where the tassels should be. That could be a cost-saving discovery for the seed industry. Hybrid seed producers must painstakingly remove the male pollen-producing tassels from each plant so that they do not pollinate themselves. Maize plants that produce only female organs would eliminate the detasseling step.
