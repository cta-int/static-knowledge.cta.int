						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>In order to understand the regional research needs and priorities and to develop strategic partnership for the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) research at national and regional scales, CCAFS East Africa Program has been actively engaging partners at national and regional levels. As part of the engagement process, three national consultative workshops on priorities for agricultural adaptation and mitigation research were held in Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda in 2011. At the regional level, two workshops were held: a farmer consultation workshop in partnership with Eastern Africa Farmers Federation (EAFF) that discussed the linkages between climate change and agriculture, farmer participation in research priority setting, scaling up knowledge generation and dissemination, and enhancing resiliency and adaptive capacity; and a workshop on improving regional climate information and food system coordination in order to consult key stakeholders from the region on regional agricultural and food security contingency planning processes, current and potential use of climate-related information, and means of improving planning and coordination in East Africa. A major outcome of the consultative meetings is a synthesis of the regional research needs and priorities, including opportunities for pilot participatory research activities at CCAFS sites in East Africa.(CCAFS, 1/8/2012)<a href="http://ccafs.cgiar.org/blog/responding-research-needs-climate-change-and-agriculture-east-africa" target="_blank">http://ccafs.cgiar.org/blog/responding-research-needs-climate-change-and-agriculture-east-africa</a></p>

					<p>A Kansas State University-led study looked at the drought tolerance of 426 species of grass from around the world. The goal was to better understand how grasslands in different parts of the world may respond to the changes in frequency and severity of drought in the future. Grasslands have several important ecological functions: they convert and store carbon dioxide, are a food source for grazing animals like cattle and bison, and help cool the surrounding atmosphere. The goal of the study was to drought-stress the species of grass to identify the ones that could survive without water for over a week’s time. Researchers developed a drought index for the tested species based on the data. The index details each species' tolerance to drought and can help ecologists understand why grasslands around the world are composed of their species.<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-08/ksu-dkg080812.php" target="_blank">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-08/ksu-dkg080812.php</a>(EurekAlert, 8/8/2012)</p>

					<p>During the 2nd African Organic Conference held in Lusaka, Zambia 2-4 May 2012 on the theme ‘Mainstreaming Organic Agriculture in the African Development Agenda’ participants agreed that organic agriculture is becoming a key component of sustainable development. Research has shown that the adoption of organic agriculture practices significantly increases yields and food security and makes producers less vulnerable to international input price volatility, and promotes environmental sustainability, among other benefits. In this regard, a declaration adopted at the conference welcomed the institutionalisation of AfroNet (African Organic Network), the umbrella organisation uniting and representing African organic stakeholders. The declaration calls upon the African Union to mainstream organic agriculture into all areas of its work, including the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP).(Excerpt from ICTSD, 13/6/2012)News: <a href="http://ictsd.org/i/agriculture/135315/ " target="_self">http://ictsd.org/i/agriculture/135315/</a>Declaration: <a href="http://unctad.org/meetings/en/SessionalDocuments/ditc_tedb_ted0041_en.pdf" target="_self">http://unctad.org/meetings/en/SessionalDocuments/ditc_tedb_ted0041_en.pdf</a></p>

					<p>The forum brings together African Heads of State, ministers, private agribusiness firms, financial institutions, farmers, NGOs, civil society organizations and scientists to discuss and develop concrete investment plans for scaling agricultural development success in Africa. The forum which takes place from September 26 to 28 2012, will focus on unlocking Africa’s agricultural potential by empowering smallholder farmers across the continent. By collaborating with farmer’s organizations, civil society and other partners, the discussions will explore new ways to provide resources, overcome challenges and improve yields for the millions of farmers who are working less than two hectares of land across the continent.(AfricaBrains, 23/8/2012)<a href="http://africanbrains.net/2012/08/23/tanzanian-minister-of-agriculture-and-agra-president-challenge-african-leadership-to-take-food-security-action/" target="_blank">http://africanbrains.net/2012/08/23/tanzanian-minister-of-agriculture-and-agra-president-challenge-african-leadership-to-take-food-security-action/</a></p>

					<p>The five regional-level training workshops, which were organised in April and June 2012, provided training on the CAADP agenda, Strategic Analysis and Knowledge Support System (SAKSS) concepts, monitoring and evaluation, agricultural policy analysis and knowledge management tools. The gatherings were also used as a forum for discussing and sharing experiences that enhanced ideas on how country SAKSS can be designed in the different countries. Through discussions, participants identified country needs as far as SAKSS is concerned. This has already helped to improve the methodology and instruments used for undertaking the country SAKSS capacity needs assessments that were recently launched. The results of the assessments, hopefully, will help governments and stakeholders identify capacities, analytical tools, and information to generate credible, timely and high quality knowledge products to inform and guide agricultural sector policies and planning and review processes.(RekSASS, 28/8/2012)<a href="http://blog.resakss.org/2012/08/28/summary-report-of-the-five-regional-level-workshops-on-capacity-strengthening-released/" target="_blank">http://blog.resakss.org/2012/08/28/summary-report-of-the-five-regional-level-workshops-on-capacity-strengthening-released/</a></p>

					<p>Agricultural researchers in developing countries are keen to communicate their research to non-experts, but often feel hampered by institutional barriers and a lack of support, according to a survey reported by SciDev (10/8/2012) and published in the current issue of <i>Agricultural Information Worldwide</i>. The aim of this survey was to gain greater understanding of researcher behaviour and attitudes in relation to communicating research outputs and making such output open and accessible. The survey analysis shows that, although researchers are driven in their work by many different and interacting motivations, institutional/organizational factors are very important and have much influence over individuals’ behaviour. Further, current behaviours in choosing routes to communicate research results are still strongly biased toward the traditional routes of publishing in journals and books and appearing at conferences, though the availability and increasing use of digital formats is starting to broaden the spread of communication pathways used.<a href="http://www.scidev.net/en/agriculture-and-environment/news/agricultural-research-communication-needs-more-support--1.html" target="_blank">http://www.scidev.net/en/agriculture-and-environment/news/agricultural-research-communication-needs-more-support--1.html</a></p>

					<p>Vanuatu is set to become a world leader in involving small scale cocoa growers in taking their product to the world. A new database system developed by African Pacific Vanuatu Ltd, a private sector organisation, will allow growers to take charge of their organic or fair trade certification for the first time and directly link them with customers. The enterprise calls itself a transparent service provider – a match-maker dedicated to getting a better deal for growers. Certification costs are high for small growers but in Vanuatu, the high cost is overcome by using mobile communications to create and update an accurate computer-based database that can be controlled by growers.(Pacific Growers, 23/7/2012)<a href="http://pacificgrowers.net/vanuatu-gives-market-power-to-small-cocoa-farmers/" target="_blank">http://pacificgrowers.net/vanuatu-gives-market-power-to-small-cocoa-farmers/</a></p>

					<p>by recent agronomic research. Christian Dupraz, a researcher at the National Institute for Agronomic Research (INRA) in Montpellier, has been studying this type of mixed farming for the past 20 years. He believes in the importance of switching to ‘agro-ecological’ systems that do not depend on the petrochemical industry. ‘The fertility of French land is due to its forests, which have enriched it with carbon. Planting trees can replace chemical fertilisers’, he said.(The Guardian, 21/8/2012)<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/21/agroforestry-france-farming-revival" target="_blank">http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/21/agroforestry-france-farming-revival</a></p>

					<p>The Technical Centre for Agriculture and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU (CTA), proposes to build upon the strengths of phase 1 of The Integrated Seed Sector Development (ISSD) project which was carried out by a consortium led by the Centre for Development Innovation of Wageningen UR, the African Union Commission /African Seed and Biotechnology Programme, Plantum NL and, Self Help Africa (SHA) and support the engagement of African universities in Phase II of the project. The Objective of Phase II is to strengthen the development of a vibrant, commercial and pluralistic seed sector in Africa. &nbsp;Specifically, the objective will be to (i) conduct a survey and assess practices of seed entrepreneurs at multiple scales; (ii) assess relevant programmes and policies; (iii) explore and document ways in which practices, programmes and policies can be strengthened in promoting seed entrepreneurship; (iv) enhance the capacity of seed sector professionals promoting seed entrepreneurship; (v) enhance the capacity of universities acting as facilitator and catalyst in increasing food security and promoting seed entrepreneurship.The project will operate in the following countries: Burundi, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Uganda and Zambia. Instead of a linear approach, ISSD fosters pluralism in matching food seed security to private sector development. It embraces variations among seed systems and thereby facilitates seed programmes and policies becoming coherent with the practices of farmers and a diversity of entrepreneurs in the seed sector. At the end of the ISSD Project phase I in 2010/2011, results were confirmed during national multi-stakeholder workshops. &nbsp;The main conclusions were the following: (i) The co-existence of multiple seed systems; (ii) Seed systems require targeted policies and programmes to enable their development; (iii) The seed sector in Africa faces common challenges in fine tuning roles and responsibilities of the public, private, NGO and civil sector; (iv) The transformation from Government and NGO distribution or relief seed provision to sustainable market-based systems.&nbsp;</p>

He said the series of workshops will seek to determine stakeholder needs and how best to strengthen the capacity of the Rural Physical Planning Division (RPPD) to respond and forge partnerships. GIS for food security would help set export strategies, adapt to climate change and support agricultural land management.(<a href="http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120823/business/business6.html" target="_blank">The Gleaner</a>, 23/8/2012)</p>

					<p>More than a dozen agricultural research institutes in Côte d'Ivoire have agreed to open up access to their research results and raise farmers' awareness of their work through a shared online platform. The aim is to increase the uptake of new and existing technologies and research findings, and eventually to boost agricultural production in the country and West African region, <a href="http://www.scidev.net/en/agriculture-and-environment/news/ivorian-agricultural-scientists-open-up-their-research.html " target="_blank">SciDev reports</a> (14/8/2012).&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Improvements in vegetable production, transport and marketing are important to the well being of small holder farmers in Papua New Guinea, and opportunities for strengthening the industry and enhancing performance can be achieved by use of value chain analysis. A project on ‘Increasing Vegetable Production in Central Province, Papua New Guinea to Supply Port Moresby Markets’ funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) and led by the Tasmanian Institute of Agricultural Research is identifying and addressing vegetable supply chain priorities in Central Province of PNG. It aims to provide small farmer communities with production options and marketing skills so they can take advantage of the opportunity to improve their socioeconomic position in a sustainable manner in an economy that is expanding due to mineral and gas development projects. An integral part of the project was a value chain workshop for the stakeholders held at Pacific Advent University, Port Moresby. The value chain workshop was designed to assist stakeholders to develop skills to improve the performance of the value chain through enhancing relationships among the chain participants (or actors) – farmers, transporters, wholesalers and consumers. The ultimate aim is the development of viable, functional value chains that provide satisfactory returns to all participants in them.(<a href="http://www.agriculturesnetwork.org/resources/extra/local-vegetable-production-png " target="_blank">AgriCultures Network</a>, 2012)</p>

					<p>These days, food can be kept a lot longer than in the past. But techniques such as pasteurisation and sterilisation also affect the quality of the products. The nutritional quality suffers, the product has less aroma and the flavour and smell of the food sometimes deteriorate. New, milder preservation techniques go a long way to preventing this loss of quality. Wageningen UR Food and Biobased Research have joined forces with a group of Dutch companies in the food industry to explore the application of these techniques.(<a href="http://www.wageningenuniversity.nl/UK/newsagenda/news/research_into_mild_preservation_techniques_for_food_products.htm " target="_blank">Wageningen UR</a>, 2/7/2012)</p>

					<p>EASAC – the European Academies Science Advisory Council – announced late July 2012 the new project to address genetics and the sustainable intensification of agriculture, covering science and technology in the context of EU food security and EU-global relationship. It is meant to explore the implications of alternative policy decisions on bioscience strategies in agriculture. One of the work streams is to collect evidence on the applications of molecular biosciences in agriculture in African countries.EASAC invites contributions of written evidence to this project, to be submitted by 30 September 2012.(<a href="http://www.easac.eu/biosciences/reports-and-statements/detail-view/article/announcement.html" target="_blank">EASAC</a>, 24/7/2012)</p>

					<p>Two scientific papers on the study of the sex chromosomes of papaya have been published as cover stories in the most recent issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, the USA. Dr Qingyi Yu, a Texas AgriLife Research plant molecular biologist at Weslaco and a member of the scientific team doing the research, said their work is yielding new information about the evolution of plant sex chromosomes. Yu said she and her colleagues are studying the sex chromosomes of papaya to help growers become more efficient in the production of the fruit, estimated to grow on about one million acres worldwide. ‘Our team sequenced the hermaphrodite-specific region of the Y chromosome, HSY, and its X counterpart’, she said. ‘By comparing HSY and its X counterpart, the team revealed two large inversions occurred in the Y chromosome, which likely caused cessation of recombination between HSY and its X counterpart and resulted in additional genome rearrangements. It is surprising that the papaya X chromosome has expanded due to accumulation of transposable elements’, she continued. ‘The results changed our previous views on sex chromosome evolution.’(<a href="http://today.agrilife.org/2012/08/10/papaya-studies-in-scientific-journal/ " target="_blank">AgriLife TODAY</a>, 10/8/2012)</p>
