						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p> Under-funding has often stood in the way of agricultural research institutions in Africa. A new grant, worked between Uganda and World Bank hopes to revamp farming in the country that was once called the ‘pearl of Africa’. The World Bank has partnered with the Uganda government to offer a grant of USD840,000 to agricultural research institutions in the country. According to Dr. Emily Twinamasiko, director of the National Agricultural Research Organisation (NARO), both public and private research institutions would benefit from the competitive grant. $300,000 of the grant would cater for agricultural zoning. Under this category, there are six grants, each worth $50,000 per project for three years. At the national level, there are six grants, which will benefit six institutions, each worth $90,000. All applicants, she said, would be evaluated on their technical capacity, experience, managerial and control systems required to implement the projects. According to studies, the low productivity observed in Ugandan agriculture is not only a consequence of a lack of relevant agricultural technologies, but also of an adequate interface between research, extension and farmers themselves. During the 20-year war in Uganda's north, the Lord's Resistance Army used bushes for cover, and left many stripped of farming tools, displaced, and surviving only by planting small crops for subsistence.

					<p> A new initiative to boost cooperation sparks duplication concerns. As Europe and Africa prepare to work more closely on science and technology, an initiative to boost research collaboration between the two continents has been coolly received by EU bureaucrats who fear it may hamper their own science linkages. Science with Africa, a non-profit initiative based in Brussels, is staging a conference for scientists and policymakers in Addis Ababa in March next year. Using funding from public and private sources, it also hopes to boost international science collaboration with Africa through an office in the Ethiopian capital. The initiative follows hot on the heels of the Africa-EU strategy, which was adopted by heads of state on 9 December. The strategy lays the groundwork for the EU to build science capacity in Africa and is seen by many as an attempt by Europe to re-establish itself as the trade partner of choice for Africa, which is being wooed by emerging economies like China and India. The popularity of Science with Africa worries EU officials, who are also planning to set up a permanent office in the Ethiopian capital. They are afraid that Science with Africa will become an unnecessary go-between for Africans trying to access European science funding. Speaking at the parliamentary hearing, Rudolf Meijer of the European Commission’s research division said that while the initiative was ‘welcome as a private initiative, potentially useful for awareness raising, dissemination of information and match-making for cooperation and technology transfer’, it should not substitute EU representation in Africa.

					<p> The African Development Bank (ADB) is preparing to disburse $192.4 million to build skills on the continent. The funds are likely to be released to six countries and two regional bodies next year. ‘The aim is to build science and technology skills for the competitiveness of African economies,’ an ADB official said. Rwanda, Kenya, Mozambique and the two regional bodies will receive their shares of the money in the shape of grants. The Seychelles, Malawi and Equatorial Guinea will receive theirs as loans, since the ADB considers them economically better off. Rwanda will receive a $13 million grant to conduct a study of ways to link industry with the research community to increase productivity. It is also in line for a grant to upgrade equipment at the Kigali Institute of Science and Technology (Kist). (Source: Research Africa, 18 December 2007.)</p>

					<p> Food security activists who gathered recently in Penang, Malaysia, said they are now more concerned than ever that farmers are becoming dependent on large multinational corporations for seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and other inputs while also becoming ‘more vulnerable to pressures’ to grow genetically modified (GM) crops. The activists were gathered for the 25th anniversary of the Pesticide Action Network (PAN): a network of NGOs, institutions, and individuals in over 90 countries. Participants said that agrichemical sales have become increasingly concentrated in a handful of companies, with Syngenta, Bayer, Monsanto, BASF, Dow, and DuPont together controlling 85% of the world pesticide market. Three companies – Cargill, Archer Daniels, and Bunge – control nearly 90% of the global grain trade while 11 firms account for about half of world seed sales, of which about a quarter are sales of GM seeds. Activists were especially concerned about agricultural companies having become more ‘vertically integrated’ – defined as the ‘taking over’ of the entire food production cycle, from the development of proprietary strains of DNA and seed sales down to the distribution and retail sale of food products in supermarkets and ‘hypermarkets.’ (Source: Inter Press Service, 6 December 2007.)</p>

					<p> Small Caribbean nations see big biofuel opportunities in ethanol produced from traditional sugar crops and biodiesel from promising African palm and jatropha trees, delegates to a conference in Miami said. While the push for alternative fuels will probably not revive the failing centuries-old Caribbean sugar industry, countries like El Salvador have room to increase production, delegates said. Regional governments, however, need immediately to pass legislation mandating that gasoline be blended with ethanol so that farmers can feel confident that biofuels are the future, said Julio Arroyo of the Sugar Association of El Salvador. ‘We have 60,000 hectares (148,300 acres) of sugar. We have 300,000 hectares (741,300 acres) that are not being used, so there is a lot of opportunity,’ he said. ‘But without legislation, this industry is not going to develop.’ The Bush administration's push to increase U.S. use and production of alternative fuels as a way to lessen dependence on foreign oil spurred interest in the Caribbean basin, where shaky economies have struggled to cope with globalization.

					<p> Papua New Guinea's largest palm oil producer, New Britain Palm Oil, said on Wednesday it plans to list in London and raise £88.9 million (US$182 million). The firm hopes to benefit from a near doubling in the price of palm oil in the last year, driven by demand for biofuels and economic growth in China and India. Palm oil is also used for cooking and in products such as soap and ice cream. The company, which has 40,000 hectares of palm oil plantations and a refinery, will use the proceeds to accelerate its planting and build infrastructure. Palm-oil based biofuels have caused controversy as critics say they have encouraged the destruction of large parts of rain forest to create new agricultural land, potentially also releasing carbon dioxide from the peat contained in the soil. NBPOL said it is focused on sustainable plantations. (Source: Reuters, 12 December 2008.)</p>

					<p> <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a1200e/a1200e00.htm" target="_blank">State of Food and Agriculture 2007</a>, the FAO argues that carefully targeted payments to farmers could help protect the environment and address climate change, biodiversity loss, and water supply concerns. Agriculture uses more land and water than any other human activity. Current incentives for farmers tend to favor the production of food, fiber, and increasingly, biofuels. However, incentives typically ‘under-value’ other beneficial services that farmers can provide, such as carbon storage, flood control, clean water provision, and biodiversity conservation. The report states that payments for environmental services are one way of increasing incentives to adopt improved agricultural practices and even to offset pollution generated in other sectors. The report notes that hundreds of payment programs for environmental services are currently being implemented around the world, mainly as part of forest conservation initiatives, ‘but relatively few programmes for environmental services have targeted farmers and agricultural lands in developing countries.’ (Source: FAO Newsroom, 15 November 2007.)</p>

					<p> The DST has launched the Youth into Science Strategy (YiSS) aimed at promoting science and technology literacy among youth in the country. The DST developed the YiSS as part of its goal to promote youth empowerment in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Ultimately, this is expected to close the skills gap by supporting all efforts to improve the development of high-level researchers, scientists and technologists in the country. The departments of science and technology and education will collaborate in the implementation of the strategy. While it focuses mainly on school-going youth and undergraduate students in the science field other youth interventions are aimed at developing the skills through technical colleges and out of school programmes. Set targets include doubling the number of youth who participate in the National Science Week activities; identifying and nurturing at least 5000 talented youth from disadvantaged background through the DST’s maths and science camps by 2010.

As an Ethiopian studying abroad I am more aware of this than ever. Let me begin by telling what happened to me here in Norway where I am currently living. I was waiting in line at a bank. A very old man with a cane was also waiting, and he asked me where I was from. I told him I was from Ethiopia. He said something to the people around us in Norwegian, and suddenly everyone was looking at me with amazement. I did not understand what was being said and why I had become the center of attention. He turned to me again and said, &quot;But, you do not have food in Ethiopia, right? I felt something burning inside me. I started by saying, &quot;No, it's not like that,&quot; but I could not continue and suddenly my eyes filled with tears.

					<p> Jatropha is seen by some as the answer to the world’s fuel crisis. But it still hugely controversial in South Africa, and the government is not at all sure that the plant will solve the country’s biofuel woes. In the past couple of years biofuels, made out of food commodities such as maize and sugar cane, have been pushing up food prices, raising questions about the effects of biofuel production on food security, especially regarding the poor. But jatropha, a poisonous oilseed that yields an inedible vegetable oil used to make biofuel, does not threaten food security because it is not a food crop. The agriculture department, however, is sceptical about allowing the plant to flourish in the country. South African climatic and environmental constraints and limited agricultural production potential, jatropha is not at the moment considered a viable option as a source for biofuels.

					<p> Africa is seeking to boost the growth of its industry through a €250 million (US$350m) initiative using technology to bolster production. The scheme, named the African Technology and Innovation Initiative (ATII), has already been adopted by the continental conference of ministers of industry and should take off once heads of state give their approval at a summit next January. The €250 million is just a budget estimate. The funds have not been raised yet, although the AU said it hopes to do so via contributions from member states and international donors. The ATII would set up five African networks harnessing science and technology to shore up the continent’ s industrial base. They will be: the African Network of Design Centres, the African Network of Testing and Certification Centres, the African Network of Technology Transfer and Innovation Centres, the African Network of Business Support Service Centres and the African Network of Environmental Compliance Centre. ‘The activities of these networks – most importantly, technology transfer and innovation – will help in meeting the great technological demand of the African region and hence enable the region to acquire the status of being a technology adopter,’ said the AU in a concept note presented to the conference of ministers of industry at their first extra ordinary session held in Midrand, South Africa from 24 to 27 September.

					<p> Even the most promising new crop varieties will not by themselves bring the plentiful harvests to sub-Saharan Africa that can end poverty, because new ways to get the seeds to farmers are needed, as well as broader investment in ‘basics,’ such as roads, credit, and farmer education. Both the private and the agricultural sectors in the region are ‘woefully undeveloped,’ according to the article. Conventionally-bred New Rice for Africa, or Nerica, was developed with financing from wealthy countries and private foundations, and the seeds are ‘a marvel,’ producing bountiful rice crops resistant to drought, pests, and disease. Yet a decade after their introduction, they have spread to only ‘a tiny fraction’ of the land in West Africa where the rice could help millions of farming families escape poverty. ‘This is a story repeated thousands of times all over Africa,’ says Joseph Devries, who is the head of seed development for the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA). ‘You have farmers who are very willing adopters of new technologies and want to raise yields, but are not getting access to seed, fertilizer and small-scale irrigation.’ He says that finding a sustainable way to supply these farmers with seed ‘is emerging as the holy grail for agricultural development.’ The African Development Bank is financing a US$34 million program in seven countries to promote wider use of the Nerica seeds, but the obstacles are ‘daunting.’ Source: Celia W. Dugger, New York Times, 10 October 2007.</p>

					<p> A UN expert on the right to food has called for a five-year moratorium on the production of biofuel out of concern that it was contributing to hunger by using up increasing amounts of farmland. On the eve of World Food Day, Jean Ziegler countered President Bush's call for an increase in biofuel, arguing farm production should be used to contain hunger instead. ‘You don't have the right, even if you're battling climate change, to (perpetuate) this total massacre’ caused by lack of food, he said. Using biofuels instead of gasoline in cars is generally considered to cut CO2 emissions, although some scientists say greenhouse gases released during the production of biofuel crops can offset those gains. The use of crops for biofuel has become especially predominant in Brazil and the United States. In March 2007, President Bush and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil signed an agreement committing their countries to increased ethanol production.

					<p> Tef (Eragrostis tef) is Ethiopia's main cereal crop, covering more than one million hectares of land. Its advantages are numerous, such as its capacity to tolerate both drought and waterlogging. However, tef's yields leave much to be desired. The plants are often victims of lodging, a weakness of the stem that causes the plant to fall, over resulting in considerable harvest losses, both in terms of quality and quantity. The FAO estimates the losses to be about 17%. Zerihun Tadele, an Ethiopian researcher at the University of Bern, Switzerland, has been conducting research which he hopes will lead to the development of dwarf tef varieties that will be resistant to lodging, especially after fertiliser applications. With support from the Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture, Tadele is using a genetic technique called tilling to identify the genes responsible for the trait that one wishes to modify, which in this case is plant height. The technique has been successfully used on maize, wheat and barley. Tadele has already managed to produce candidate dwarf lines. The final results concerning dwarf tef's performance are expected in June 2008. Source: Oromia Times, 16 October 2007.</p>
