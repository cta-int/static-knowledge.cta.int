						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Kenyan scientists have asked for the establishment of a Chief Scientist Advisor to the government and the establishment of a science office at the National Assembly. The move, they said would help the country develop evidence-based policies that are informed by scientific research findings. There has been concern in the country that although the government continues to provide resources for research, the impact of science is not being felt at the policy formulation and implementation stages. The scientists feel that there is limited coordination of national research effort, assessment of research output, and performance measurement (Source: by Henry Neondo, Africa Science News Service, 3 July 2008). </p>

					<p>Malawi has become the latest sub-Saharan African country to approve a National Biotechnology Policy aimed to provide a framework for effective implementation of biotechnology programs and activities. The Policy is an answer to a study conducted in Malawi in early 2000 supported by the Africa Biodiversity Network (ABN) to establish the status of Genetic Engineering (GE), Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and GE food aid in Malawi which found that genetic engineering in general and agricultural biotechnology in particular is only at a rudimentary level in Malawi being confined to the second-generation order characterized by tissue culture and application of molecular markers within the University of Malawi (Source: Africa Science News Service, 19 July 2008). </p>

					<p>According to the Ministry of agriculture in Zimbabwe 80% of communal farmers in Zimbabwe are women and 10% of the extension staff are women. On a global scale, women constitute the majority and are most engaged in agriculture. If interventions in agriculture are to engineer a green revolution in Africa and turn Africa from its hunger, disease and malnutrition brand, it is urgent that the continent revisits gender issues in the agricultural development. An X-ray view of gender issues in agriculture will reveal constraints ranging from-lack of relevant client based and customized agricultural extension aimed at serving the needs of women in agriculture, a skewed resource ownership tilted against women, patriarchal views discouraging women from leadership roles in society, limited land rights to women in Africa and lack of technical know-how (Source: by Hillary Kundishora, The African Executive, 18-25 June 2008).</p>

					<p>The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, UNESCO, is to partner up with the Kenya government in a scheme aimed at boosting the number of female scientists in the country. A recent UNESCO report asks African governments to give the greatest priority possible to helping women evolve and grow in their country, and more particularly, through education, training and all necessary measures, helping them participate fully, as the equals of men, in the international community’s efforts to make science a privileged instrument for durable development.

					<p>Although they play a pivotal role in African agriculture, women have to contend with limited access to financial and technical resources, skewed land policies, lack of know-how and appropriate technology. Whatever challenge affects smallscale farmers, women are the worst hit as they form a majority in this group. The role of women in African agriculture may be receiving increasing international interest, particularly as former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan recently remarked that, &quot;a green revolution in Africa will happen only if there is also a gender revolution.&quot; However, although the empowerment of women in agriculture may have been much talked about in recent years, little progress has actually been made (Source: by Busani Bafana, The New Agriculturist, July 2008).</p>

					<p>A declaration released at a food summit convened by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UN-FAO) called for the international community “to increase assistance for developing countries, in particular the least developed countries and those that are most negatively affected by high food prices”. On the “contentious” issue related to the challenges and opportunities biofuels, the declaration calls for an in-depth study to ensure sustainable production and use of biofuels in accordance with the “three pillars of sustainable development” and the maintenance of food security. National governments, the private sector, civil society, and inter-governmental agencies are called upon “to foster a coherent, effective and results-oriented international dialogue on biofuels in the context of food security and sustainable development needs”.

					<p>Battered by soaring fertiliser prices and rioting rice farmers, the global food industry may also have to deal with a potentially catastrophic future shortage of phosphorus, scientists say. Researchers in Australia, Europe and the United States have given warning that the element, which is essential to all living things, is at the heart of modern farming and has no synthetic alternative, is being mined, used and wasted as never before. Natural distribution of phosphorus could create a small number of new “resource superpowers” with a pricing control over fertilisers that some suspect could end up rivalling Opec's control over crude oil. The economic battle to secure phosphorus supply may already have begun. The answer, say crop scienctists, lies in better husbandry of phosphorus reserves: an effort that may require the creation of an international body to monitor the use and recycling of phosphorus (Source: by Leo Lewis, The Times, 23 June 2008).</p>

					<p>Scientists have developed new cotton varieties to tame jassids, the notorious cotton pest which has been causing havoc in the 35 cotton growing districts. The insects cause cotton leaves to curl at the edges, turning yellow or redish and may dry in severe cases. The pests may lead to stunted growth and can reduce yields by up to 80% in severe cases. Dr George Epieru, an insect expert at the National Semi-Arid Resources Research Institute in Soroti district, says many farmers in Lango, Acholi and Kasese districts had given up cotton production due to the insects (Source: by Kikonyogo Ngatya, New Vision, 24 June, 2008).</p>

					<p>Biofuels have forced global food prices up by 75% - far more than previously estimated - according to a confidential World Bank report obtained by the Guardian. The damning unpublished assessment is based on the most detailed analysis of the crisis so far, carried out by an internationally-respected economist at global financial body. &quot;Without the increase in biofuels, global wheat and maize stocks would not have declined appreciably and price increases due to other factors would have been moderate,&quot; says the report. The basket of food prices examined in the study rose by 140% between 2002 and this February. The report estimates that higher energy and fertiliser prices accounted for an increase of only 15%, while biofuels have been responsible for a 75% jump over that period (Source: by Aditya Chakrabortty, The Guardian, 4 July 2008).</p>

					<p>The Agricultural Research Council (ARC) has developed new potato varieties with food production, storage and environmental benefits that can be added to their potato breeding programme and made available to both smallholder and commercial farmers once they are approved. The research partnership is financially supported by USAID.The ARC will apply to national authorities for a safety assessment and general release approval of their SpuntaG2 potato, which is resistant against potato tuber moth damage in the field and in storage. This approval will enable the ARC to initiate farmer participatory trials under unconfined conditions and develop a certification and labelling system to prepare for commercial release of improved potato varieties. This is the first publicly funded genetically modified (GM) crop to enter the safety approval process for general use in South Africa. Approved cotton, maize and soybean events are produced by seed companies (Source: by Dr. Kobie de Ronde, ARC-LNR, 7 July 2008).</p>

					<p>Responding to Commission President José Manuel Barroso's request, the EU executive's ethical advisory body will issue an opinion on modern agricultural technologies by the end of 2008. The European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies examines, at the request of the Commission President or on its own initiative, ethical questions arising from the rapid advances in science and technology. It issues ethical opinions, the aim of which are to provide expertise in connection with the Commission's preparation and implementation of Community legislation or policies. Europe can perhaps afford to make a fuss about food safety and ask for the precautionary principle to be respected as the continent still has enough food to eat but this is not the case for all regions of the world, he added. &quot;Agricultural innovation is ethical,&quot; said Gruissem, underlining that the challenge was rather to ascertain which technologies are needed to improve food standards for all (Source: Euractiv.com, 23 June 2008). </p>

					<p>Livestock has for long been a major source of food for humanity the world over. But with increased debate on climate change, scientists are beginning to weigh cost-benefit of livestock to the debate as it is a major contributor of the dangerous greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. Land use and agriculture alone contributes to a third of the greenhouse gas emission into the atmospher,where land takes 18% and agriculture 14%. According to a 2006 United Nations initiative, the livestock industry is one of the largest contributors to environmental degradation worldwide and modern practices of raising animals for food contributes on a massive scale to air and water pollution, land degradation, climate change and loss of biodiversity (Source: by Pius Sawa, African Science News Service, 28 June 2008).</p>

					<p>Temperature and other variations resulting from climate change will have a strong impact on fisheries and aquaculture, with significant food security consequences for certain populations, FAO said this week. The UN food agency’s note of caution came at the start of a four day scientific symposium on climate change and marine fisheries being held at its Rome headquarters (8-11 July 2008). The event, which involves over 200 experts and policymakers from around the globe, aims to paint a fuller picture of the challenges that climate change poses to marine fisheries and the millions of people who depend on them for food and income. FAO also noted however that the impacts of climate-related physical and biological changes in fisheries on the communities that depend on them will be as varied as the changes themselves. Both negative and positive impacts are likely, depending on local circumstances and the vulnerability and adaptive capacity of the affected communities (Source: FAO Newsroom, 10 July 2008).</p>

					<p>Research is identifying new development options that will help pastoral peoples and lands of the South adapt to big and fast changes. Over 180 million people in the developing world, especially in dry areas, depend solely on livestock and pastoral systems for their livelihoods. Grassland-based pastoral and agro-pastoral systems are undergoing unprecedented changes that are bringing new opportunities as well as problems. Research is helping to identify new development options for pastoralists that reduce risks and enhance their ability to adapt to changing climates, markets and circumstances. Pastoral lands are crucial for the production of ecosystem goods and services, for tourism and for mitigating climate change. Pastoral systems can no longer be viewed as livestock enterprises, but as multiple use systems that have important consequences for the environment and more diversified livelihood strategies (Source: by Dr. Carlos Seré, ILRI, 10 July 2008).</p>

					<p>Caution needs to be exercised in developing African food production to avoid long-term social and environmental harm, according to an ecologist credited with averting mass hunger on the continent. Hans Herren, president of the U.S.-based Millennium Institute, says that some of the prescriptions offered for extricating Africa from its current crisis over high food prices may ultimately cause more damage than good. Aid specifically geared to help unlock the potential of African agriculture has slumped, too. Even though the total amount of all development aid given by rich countries to the poor grew by 250 percent between the early 1980s and 2005, the proportion of that assistance devoted to farming fell from 17 percent to 3 percent (Source: by David Cronin, IPS, 3 July 2008).</p>

					<p>Harvesting of the 2008 main season cereal crops is underway or due to start soon in Somalia, Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya. In Ethiopia the harvest of the secondary &quot;belg&quot; crop is in progress. Although the important March-May rains improved towards the end of the period, cumulative totals remain below normal in large areas of Ethiopia, Somalia, parts of western Kenya and in the Karamoja region of Uganda. Thus, crop prospects in these countries remain generally poor. The failure of the 2008 Gu crop, which follows two below-average seasons (Gu 2007 and Deyr 2007/08), has resulted in a critical food supply position. The humanitarian situation is rapidly deteriorating due to a combination of increasing food prices, a significant devaluation of the Somali Shilling, disruption of internal markets and internal trade, and mounting civil insecurity. Overall, sorghum prices have increased in the Sorghum Belt by more than 60 percent since January 2008. In April, the highest sorghum prices were in Beletweyne market (SOS 7 500 per kg) and Hudur (SOS 7 250 per kg). The lowest prices were reported in Bardera and Baidoa where sorghum was quoted SOS 3 600 per kg and SOS 5 150 per kg, respectively (Source: FAO/GIEWS Global Watch, 15 July 2008).</p>

					<p>Genetically modified crops will not solve the current food crisis, according to the head of one of the world's largest agricultural biotechnology companies. Martin Taylor, chairman of Syngenta, said the current industry focus on farmers in rich countries meant it would take 20 years to launch crop varieties designed to address the problems of the developing world. He told the Guardian: &quot;GM won't solve the food crisis, at least not in the short term.&quot; His words appear to contradict statements from UK politicians, industry bodies and the European Commission that GM technology should be considered as a way to address chronic shortages and soaring prices of basic staples across the world (Source: by David Adam, The Guardian, 27 June 2008).</p>

					<p>Scientists in Ghana and Tanzania are eligible for more than £3 million (nearly US$6 million) in funds, a new partnership of two British organisations announced this week (7 July). The UK-based Leverhulme Trust will fund research projects in the two African countries with the help of the Royal Society. The partnership's five research priorities are &quot;agriculture, water, sanitation, basic human health research, and biodiversity and energy&quot;, Lorna Casselton, foreign secretary of the Royal Society, said in a press statement. Applications for the grants will open in October 2008. The first six grants will be awarded by May 2009, with the remaining dozen due in 2010 and 2011 (Source: by Christina Scott, SciDev, 11 July 2008).</p>
