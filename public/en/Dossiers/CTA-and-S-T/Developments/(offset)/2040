						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p> Establishing an efficient and sustainable seed supply system is a critical prerequisite for agriculture-led development since seeds are the single most essential input in crop agriculture, Josephine Okot, CEO Victoria Seeds Ltd has said. Speaking in May 2008 at a small holder farmer’s meeting in Nairobi, Okot said seeds are the carriers of genetic potential of plants and determine the upper limit on yield while other inputs such as fertilizers and crop protection products simply build the environment enabling the plant to perform productively. Due to lack of investments in the sector, Okot said Africa’s crop agricultural output still rely on the resource poor smallholder farmers’ practicing rain-fed farming, with very low mechanization largely still using the rudimentary hand hoe as their primary production tool with only limited use of animal plough and operating under conditions of natural resource degradation. She said this calls for harmonization of seed policies and regulations among the countries of the region which could help establish a common market with an effective demand large enough to induce needed investment and create the competition required to establish sustainable and efficient seed industry in the three sub-regions.

					<p> Vaccines that survive without refrigeration based on Africa’s ‘resurrection’ plant and a pioneering water harvesting system to recycle steam from cooling towers and allowing buildings to collect their own water supplies from the air inspired by the way the Namib Desert Beetle of Namibia harvests water from desert fogs, are some of inventions, innovations and ideas at the centre of a new collaborative initiative called Nature’s 100 Best. It is aimed at showcasing how tomorrow’s economy can be realized today by learning, copying and mimicking the way nature has already solved many of the technological and sustainability problems confronting humankind. By 2025, the United Nations forecasts that 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with water scarcity and two thirds of the world’s population could be under conditions of water stress. Climate change is expected to aggravate water problems via more extreme weather events. Many intelligent and improved management options can overcome these challenges and one may rest on the extraordinary ability of the Namib Desert beetle.

					<p> Burkina Faso in Western Africa is one of the poorest countries in the world with 90 percent of the population engaged in subsistence agriculture. Where possible, farmers are producing cotton as a cash crop, accounting for more than 50 percent of all exports in Burkina Faso. However, cotton production in Burkina Faso is susceptible to frequent drought and insect infestations that can often result in damage to up to 90 percent of the crop. As a result, cotton production is highly dependent on insecticide treatments to control these pests. To provide growers with more options for insect control and potentially greater productivity in the field, Burkina Faso began field trials and evaluations with genetically modified (GM) or transgenic cotton crops in 2003. If approved for commercial use, Burkinabe farmers are expected to benefit from less labor, less pesticide spraying and increased income.

					<p> &nbsp; The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) has convened top agricultural regulatory agencies today to discuss ways to repair the failing seed production systems in the continent that could suffer the most from current food crisis. Through its Program for Africa’s Seeds Systems (PASS), AGRA recognizes that improved seed is an important tool towards helping farmers attain food security. Yet in many African countries, these regulatory agencies are understaffed and under funded, and appear to be overwhelmed as the private seed sector begins to take root and grow. As a result, uncertified seed often finds its way to the market. Production fields are rarely inspected and seed processing procedures are rarely followed. “One of the primary goals of the PASS strategy is to establish a vibrant, competitive African seed sector, and this can only be achieved by working closely with various stakeholders in the seed value chain,” explained Bigirwa. While AGRA has given support to a number of private seed companies, it has not yet engaged the seed regulatory agencies. Source: African Science News Service, Nairobi, 3 June 2008. </p>

					<p> Scientists at the University of Liverpool are investigating how a Madagascan plant could be used to help produce crops in harsh environmental conditions. The plant, Kalanchoe fedtschenkoi, is unique because, unlike normal plants, it captures most of its carbon dioxide at night when the air is cooler and more humid, making it 10 times more water-efficient than major crops such as wheat. Kalanchoe is a good example of how plants can flourish in harsh environments. If we can understand how it is able to photosynthesise using much less water than current crops, we may be able to use its genetic code to develop a crop able to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The researchers believe that the novel genes found in Kalanchoe could provide a model of how energy crops could be grown on un-utilised desert and semi-arid lands, rather than on farmland needed for producing food.

	The results of a painstaking examination of global agriculture have been formally presented with the release of the final report for the International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD), Cape Town South Africa, mid-April 2008. The assessment has explored how agriculture can be reinvented to feed the world's expanding population sustainably in an era of multiple challenges -- not least those presented by climate change and a growing food crisis that has led to outbreaks of violence in a number of developing countries. Both scientific knowledge and traditional skills were evaluated under the IAASTD, which marked the first attempt to bring all actors in agriculture together to address food security (see <a href="http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=41983" target="_blank">Q&amp;A interview with Robert Watson</a>). Amongst the 22 findings of the study that chart a new direction for agriculture: a conclusion that the dominant practice of industrial, large-scale agriculture is unsustainable, mainly because of the dependence of such farming on cheap oil, its negative effects on ecosystems – and growing water scarcity. Instead, monocultures must be reconsidered in favour of agro-ecosystems that marry food production with ensuring water supplies remain clean, preserving biodiversity, and improving the livelihoods of the poor.

Over the past few years, Robert Watson has had what must qualify as one of the world's tougher assignments: heading an initiative to help agriculture cope with the substantial challenges it faces presently, and the even bigger hurdles ahead. The three-year International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) has sought to evaluate agricultural knowledge across the spectrum, with the help of governments, civil society, the private sector, and hundreds of experts. The findings of the assessment are being formally presented after they were reviewed at an intergovernmental plenary in Johannesburg, South Africa, on 7–12 April. Stephen Leahy chatted to Watson at this meeting about the landmark IAASTD.Source: Interview with Robert Watson, IPS, 15 April 2008.  </p>

The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA)’s sponsored second cohort of agricultural PhD candidates from a number of African countries have graduated today from their advanced studies program at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. The graduates, expected to employ the knowledge gained in their studies to improve African food security across eastern and southern Africa are accredited for initiating a number of programmes. For example, Dr. Joseph Kamau, a graduate of the University’s Africa Centre for Crop Improvement (ACCI) from Kenya, initiated the first cassava breeding program in his country, and in only three years, developed virus resistant, fast growing, high-yielding varieties that farmers liked for their cooking qualities. Dr. Francisco Miti from Zambia bred maize for small-scale farmers’ conditions, in other words, for drought and low fertility, acid soils. &quot;This is a real breakthrough,” said Dr. Mark Laing, director of the ACCI. “These students carried out their research with limited facilities and technical support, yet they achieved significant advances in plant breeding for African farmers. AGRA has also guaranteed future funding for productive ACCI graduates, so these scientists now have the knowledge, backing, and confidence to continue their plant breeding work.” The ACCI program hopes to fill gaps left by the “brain drain’’ of African researchers leaving the continent and by the paucity of training opportunities in Africa for its scientists. It focuses on crops that are of critical importance to African food security and students have committed to working on staple food crops in their home countries after graduation.

The Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cite 2007 growth rates of 5.8% for Africa and 6.5% for sub-Saharan Africa, respectively. Both note, nevertheless, that few African countries are on track to halve poverty by 2015. The IMF predictably proposes a private-sector emphasis in response, while the ECA lays out a wider range of actions. This AfricaFocus Bulletin contains a press release from the World Bank on the food price surge and the Bank’s response, excerpts from a speech by World Bank President Robert Zoellick, and a report on new FAO proposals for changes in food security operations and planning.

					<p> 
Uganda’s cabinet has approved the ‘long awaited’ Ugandan National Biotechnology and Biosafety Policy, which was initially developed in 2002 by the National Council for Science and Technology (UNCST). The policy aims to: build national capacity in biotechnology; promote the utilization of biotechnology products and processes as tools for national development; and provide a regulatory and institutional framework for safe and sustainable biotechnology development and application. The policy has already been subject to thorough review and deliberation by various stakeholders. Ugandan Minister of State for Finance Fred Jachan Omach spoke at the cabinet meeting at which the biosafety policy was endorsed. Omach argued at the meeting that biotechnology is one of the frontiers of agricultural and industrial research in the world today, and that Uganda should not be left behind. He added that the biosafety policy is especially needed because Uganda has already established an ultra-modern National Agricultural Biotechnology Center, at which research is being conducted for the development of GM cotton, bananas, and other crops that are to be pest and disease resistant.

Rely more on local produce to cut food import bills and provide subsidised inputs to boost production, advised the FAO as it announced measures to help poor countries, many of which will now have to pay 74 percent more for food - up by US$6 billion from February 2008. Under the Initiative on Soaring Food Prices (ISFP), FAO will kick-off with short-term measures such as providing subsidised fertiliser to boost food production in three African countries affected by food riots - Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Senegal. Mozambique, the fourth African country, included in the pilot will use a blend of cassava and wheat flour to produce bread to help lower the country’s wheat import bill. ‘The initiative will be rolled out in other countries in the second phase,’ said Liliana Balbi, senior economist with FAO’s Global Information and Early Warning Service. Details of the second phase were not announced. The UN agency also announced the launch of Food Market Information Units (FMIU) in countries worldwide to help monitor, collect and analyse food prices to help humanitarian agencies and countries come up with more nuanced responses to food insecurity and vulnerability. FAO has allocated US$17 million towards the two measures. The sharp rise in international cereal prices, freight rates and oil prices has pushed up the food import bills in many low-income food-deficit countries in Africa, said the new FAO Crop Prospects and Food Situation Report. World cereal stocks are expected to fall to a 25-year-low of 405 million tonnes in 2007/08, down 21 million tonnes, or 5 percent, from their already reduced level of the previous year.

Together with the Rockefeller Foundation, the Gates Foundation has pledged a total of $150 million ‘to help millions of small-scale farmers and their families lift themselves out of poverty and hunger’ in Africa. AGRA has promised to do this by overhauling Africa’s agricultural industry, from planting seeds to restructuring local and national markets. This special issue brings together critical views on the ‘Green Revolution’ approach to Africa’s food crisis, including an article by Galés Gabirondo who looks at the Bill Gates philosophy of philanthro-capitalism.
