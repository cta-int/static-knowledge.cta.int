						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p> 
The need to look beyond an agricultural paradigm and embrace a more holistic view of biofuels was one of the points highlighted by Southern African Biofuels Association (Saba) president Andrew Makenete at a recent biofuels conference. Makenete commented that the biofuels debate had been too narrow, and that the solutions had focused mainly on the role of farmers, without taking into account all the potential producers. He said he believed that this mindset and framework needed to be challenged. Makenete stressed that there had not been a proper biofuels framework in Africa. Africa, unlike the rest of the world, wanted to ‘bite big problems with big solutions’, rather than tackling the biofuels issues incrementally. While the level of awareness of biofuels in Africa had generally improved, the biofuels lobby had not been as successful as was hoped in promoting biofuels growth in Africa. He stressed the need to build new biofuels alliances that were inclusive of all relevant stakeholders and groups, such as trade unions, farmers’ unions, and consumer groups, so that all relevant interests could be brought to the party. He added that the Southern African Development Community (SADC) needed to have consensus, so that business could view the SADC as one entity, rather than as competing countries. More could still be done strategically at a regional level. He believed that, in the SADC region there needed to be more action and less talk with regard to biofuels. Mozambique has plenty of land available for biofuels production, but lacks infrastructure, capacity, and a framework, all of which South Africa could provide.Source: Engineering News, 21 March 2008. </p>

Africa has potential to become a major exporter of biofuels, but investors must factor in a need for costly new infrastructure and overcome red tape before the sector takes off. Meghan Sapp, MD of Brussels-based HG Consulting, told a conference that Southern Africa, Kenya and Nigeria were among countries with potential to produce sugarcane- and cassava-based ethanol biofuel for export. ‘Biofuel production on a commercial scale in Africa is a fairly new idea but one that opens a lot of opportunities for both investment and local economic development,’ said Sapp. Europe was likely to become the main market for African ethanol exports because of Africa’s preferential trade agreements with the EU. Investors are looking for cheap sustainable forms of energy, such as ethanol, to respond to persistent high oil prices. Africa was well-suited to biofuel production because it has plenty of available land, many climates fit for different biofuel feedstocks, and low labour costs. However, poor infrastructure, under-developed legislation and a loose regulatory framework would hamper biofuel investments in Africa. New biofuel plants will need good roads connecting to ports, and schools and clinics to serve the families of local workforces, such as sugarcane growers. It could take at least 10 years before biofuel production achieves critical mass in Africa. ‘Several ethanol projects are under way in a number of African countries which could be onstream before 2010,’ she said, referring to Mozambique, Nigeria and Sudan among others. Africa is currently a marginal biofuel producer with an ageing vehicle fleet largely run on diesel, ill-adapted for conversion to biofuel use. Early potential in biofuels is seen mainly in exports, although domestic sales to new vehicle fleets would help reduce reliance on fossil fuel imports. A handful of countries including Ethiopia, Uganda and Nigeria are already developing biofuel blending policies for their domestic vehicle fleets. Some African countries are also researching new applications for biofuels, for example cooking fuel that could be used to replace fire wood. Source: Reuters, 20 March 2008.  </p>

					<p> 
Africa is the continent hardest hit by climate change and already struggles to feed its people. But a research centre in Cotonou, Benin, is developing a new variety of rice that it plans to distribute to local farmers, helping to alleviate food security concerns. The Benin research was highlighted two weeks ago when PhD student Yonelle Moukoumbi was awarded a L’Oréal/Unesco for Women in Science fellowship to fund her studies of the genetic diversities of new varieties of rice. Fifteen fellowships are awarded every year to female scientists. Moukoumbi, a citizen of Gabon, is the first researcher from her country to receive this award. She is currently a student at the University of Abomey-Calavi in Benin. The Africa Rice Centre has developed a hybrid species of rice known as Nerica (New Rice for Africa) by crossing African and Asian rice varieties. African rice is a rugged plant, well adapted for local conditions, but has a poor yield. Asian rice has a much higher yield, but requires abundant water and is more susceptible to African pests and disease. But the Nerica rice combines the ruggedness of African plants with the Asian plants’ high yields. Moukoumbi will analyse the genetic characteristics of different varieties of Nerica rice growing in lowland areas of Benin, where rainfall is ‘extremely irregular’. To ensure that only those Nerica varieties best adapted to the lowland areas are adopted by African farmers, Moukoumbi will identify which gene sequences are associated with high productivity and resistance to plant pathogens and drought. Once developed, the rice will be distributed to farmers. Improving rice production would go a long way to improving food security in Africa. ‘It might not be cheaper than importing rice, but it is important for farmers to grow their own food,’ she said.

					<p> 
Will sorghum find its way back to the dining tables of East Africa? A new research project currently in progress aims to do that through the use of the controversial gene modification technology. A consortium of nine global scientific research bodies under the Africa Bio-fortified Sorghum (ABS) project is to develop more nutritious and easily digestible sorghum varieties for different climatic regions containing increased levels of essential amino acids, vitamins A and E, iron and zinc. Through genetic engineering, selected genes, mainly from plant sources, will be introduced into the genome of sorghum in a gradual way that the researchers say will not compromise other attributes of the grain performance. Prof Abdulkadir Egal, a researcher at the Vaal University of Technology in South Africa, says the effort is viable as the crop is native to the continent. If the project succeeds, its backers say it will significantly improve the health of more than 300 million people globally. Sorghum is one of the few crops that grow well in arid climates. The ABS project chose sorghum for its drought resistant nature, unlike other cereals such as maize and rice which require high rainfall. The project is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to the tune of $18.5 million. Sorghum originated in the highlands of Ethiopia and Sudan before spreading throughout Africa and into India. On average, sorghum accounts for only 4 per cent of the annual total cereals production in the world hence its poor rank in terms of output and total area planted.

‘Strong linkages are needed between industry and S&amp;T to prioritize innovation as part of the broader strategy to improve market competitiveness of Africa's products,’ said UN Under Secretary-General and ECA’s Executive Secretary, Mr. Abdoulie Janneh at the closing session of the Science and Africa Conference in Addis Ababa. He noted that proposals made by participants for increasing R&amp;D capacities will need collaboration with partners from both the North and South, including the EU, Korea and India. He noted a number of challenges that will require urgent solutions by the community of researchers, scientists and policy-makers, including the thorny international Intellectual Property Regimes (IPRs). Dr. Abdul Hakim from the African Union Commission (AUC) told participants that in implementing its Consolidated Plan of Action on Science and Technology, the AUC is working to see to it that Africa’s economies are driven by science. ‘We need to collaborate on solutions that alleviate poverty through more problem-solving R&amp;D and produces that bring value to society’, he said adding, ‘We should secure our part in the global economy by seeking to be driven by knowledge and skills and be able to use less land for more products, less water and less chemicals.’ The Conference came up with innovative ideas and suggestions across the board in areas such as energy, transport, infrastructure, ICTs, health, life sciences, agriculture/climate change and water. Mr Janneh lauded the AU’S visionary effort to develop a policy framework in this regard and re-affirmed ECAs readiness to work in partnership with AU to fast track work in this area. As partners in the Science and Africa initiative, ECA and AUC agreed on the importance of engaging Africa's top policy-makers in supporting R&amp;D for development through the use of existing machineries and structures with member states.

Speaking at the Annual Research Day put on by the Mico University College, Prime Minister Bruce Golding said Jamaica needs to move beyond the consumption of technology developed in other countries and embark upon research to create technology that would foster its own development. He said technological development has been moving at a fast pace globally, and that Jamaica runs the risk of being left behind. He said the country must realize that its prospects for development are increasingly dependent on knowledge and how it is applied. Golding said research should be driven and pursued with clear objectives that would enable the country to achieve and go the distances that are possible. He said one way in which research could assist Jamaica, was in determining how technology can be used to identify the energy initiatives that would reduce the country's oil bill. He said the agriculture sector was another area of the economy that would benefit tremendously from research activity, especially as it relates to finding suitable alternatives to imported feedstock. The government would be seeking to streamline research activity locally, by embarking on a programme to bring the various research institutions under one umbrella organization during the next fiscal year. This would enable more efficient and effective use of resources especially as it relates to funding. The Prime Minister said the future requires that new ways be found for doing old things simultaneously with identifying ways of doing new things. He said while research and knowledge represent a step in the right direction, it is the application of the knowledge that will take Jamaica into the future.

The first eight doctoral candidates sponsored by the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) will be entering their advanced studies at the University of Ghana, Legon, hoping to discover new ways to improve crops across West Africa, officials have announced. Prof. Eric Danquah, director of the university’s West Africa Centre for Crop Improvement (WACCI), said that the first class of elite students sends a message of hope across the region as well as establishing a groundwork for building a new generation of African scientists—a critical piece in the efforts to stop the ‘brain drain’’ of African researchers leaving the continent for the developed world. The eight were chosen from a pool of several hundred applicants. “We were extraordinarily impressed with the qualifications of all the applicants, and specifically the eight who were chosen,’’ Danquah said. ‘I look forward to guiding them through world-class agricultural science studies that will, however, focus on indigenous crops that will help the African farmer improve yields.’ Dr. Joe DeVries, head of AGRA’s seed program, said that the students represent a diversity of interests as well as countries. They come from five West African nations – Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria – and are studying seven crops – cassava, cowpea, maize, millet, rice, sorghum, and sweet potato. AGRA’s partnership with the University of Ghana, Legon, as well as the University of KwaZulu-Natal, is envisioned to train 120 promising African plant breeders into PhD scientists over the next decade. In the end, these crop scientists will help to create the critical mass of knowledge about breeding African-based crops that is needed to end food crises on the continent.

Angus Kingon, professor of engineering, and a team of graduate students will develop a course on technology innovation for the University of Cape Town in South Africa as part of an initiative introduced this month by the investment bank Goldman Sachs, which seeks to bring business education to 10,000 women in developing countries. <a href="http://www.10000women.org" target="_blank">The 10,000 Women initiative</a>, announced March 5, will get $100 million from Goldman Sachs over the next five years to develop new markets, raise the rate of GDP growth in developing countries and create business ventures that can compete internationally. The initiative will rely largely upon partnerships of US and British institutions with institutions abroad. Brown is the only American university participating in the program that is not a business school. In partnering with the University of Cape Town, Brown builds on a pre-existing relationship formed by faculty and student exchanges in the past. Kingon's project seeks to develop teaching methods to build ‘entrepreneurship capacity’ within Africa to create successful businesses that can bring African nations on a level playing field with the developed world, he said. This, he said, can be achieved by focusing on technology innovation. ‘Most programs like this create microenterprises’ that give jobs to a few people, Kingon said. ‘That's not what we're trying to do. We want to create growing jobs that can compete in the world economy.’ At the University of Cape Town, about 220 students in engineering and business graduate programs will take part in the pilot program, according to Goldman Sachs. Along with Kingon, graduate students in Brown's Program in Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship will also help measure the results of the partnership. The pilot program will eventually spread beyond the graduate level to teach other students, Kingon said. Source: Brown Daily Herald, 11 March 2008.  </p>

Responding to spiking food prices, the World Bank will nearly double the amount in loans made to help boost agricultural production in Africa to $700 million from $420 million. Record high prices for energy and agricultural commodities are hitting developing nations hard, in this case sub-Saharan Africa, given how their price indexes are weighted heavily toward food. ‘Because you don’t want everything to be a short-term response, we are really trying to upgrade our efforts in terms of increasing agricultural production,’ World Bank President Robert Zoellick told Reuters. The $700 million will be spent in fiscal 2009 which begins in June of 2008. World Bank lending for agriculture has averaged some $500 million a year, but there are plans to push it up to as much as $850 million in coming years, a bank official said. He did say the focus for agriculture production should address a whole ‘value’ chain that includes everything from property rights, seeds, fertilizers, irrigation and more. Record high commodity prices are not all bad, because some nations are net exporters of energy, minerals and grains and could offer them a way to boost agricultural infrastructure. Crude oil prices recently topped $106 a barrel, gold is making repeated runs toward $1000 an ounce, and wheat, corn and soybeans all trade at or close to records highs. Zoellick said he did not expect food or energy prices to come down any time soon.Source: Reuters, 10 March 2008.  </p>

Awarded annually since 2000, the Fellowships permit doctoral and post-doctoral women to pursue their research in host laboratories outside their home countries. They receive a maximum of US $40,000 over a period of two years. The projects that have been selected often relate to the needs of local populations or represent original fields of research, such as: the characterization of a protein with healing properties that is produced by catfish or the study by IRM of the interactions of different areas of the brain in healthy and depressed patients. This year four countries are new to the program: Gabon, Mongolia, Nepal and Slovenia. The program has recognized a total of 120 Fellows from 67 countries. The 2008 UNESCO-l’Oréal Fellows from Africa are:

					<p> 
FAO has called upon countries to participate in preparing the next Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA), the most comprehensive data collection on the state of the world’s forests to date. Started over 60 years ago, the Global Forest Resources Assessment process provides information on how much forest exists, how it is being managed and how it is being lost. Global forest cover currently amounts to just under four billion hectares or about 30 percent of the world’s land area. Although the rate of net loss of forest has decreased in recent years, the world is still losing about 200 km² of forest a day, according to FAO data. It is expected that the next report, to be finalized in 2010, will review the status of forests in 235 countries and territories, of which 175 countries have already nominated officers whose duty it will be to ensure that countries provide accurate and timely information on their forest resources. ‘The 2010 assessment will be an important tool in measuring the impact of deforestation on climate change and the role of forests in mitigating the effects of climate change’. ‘The success of FRA 2010 will depend on the extent to which countries provide accurate and objective information’, says Mette Wilkie, who oversees the data collection process at FAO. The last survey was produced with the help of over 800 people involving teams working in 172 countries and many more are likely to be involved this time around. Some 220 experts are attending a meeting at FAO to kick-start the process. Source: FAO newsroom, 6 March 2008.  </p>

A US$ 1.5 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was given to Michigan State University (MSU), to promote Africa’s biosafety capacity in partnership with the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). The grant will be used to develop the African Biosafety Network of Expertise, to help regulators access the most up-to-date training, data and resources needed to properly regulate biotechnologies. Over the next 10 months, MSU and NEPAD will undertake a consultation process with African biosafety regulators to assess needs and develop a responsive information and resource network that provides training, peer-reviewed scientific information, expert assistance and other services as required.Source: MSU press release, 25 February 2008.  </p>

The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has awarded a US$19 million grant to a poverty reduction and women’s empowerment project supported by UNDP and designed to boost the productivity and incomes of women farmers using low-cost, mechanized power. The four-year grant will help establish 600 new sustainable, rural agro-enterprises in Burkina Faso, Mali and Senegal. The centerpiece of the project is the multifunctional platform (MFP), a diesel-run engine mounted on a chassis to which a variety of processing equipment can be attached, including cereal mill, husker, battery charger, and joinery and carpentry equipment. At least 24 of these MFPs will be biofuel-based. ‘This project will employ cost-effective technology to significantly improve the lives of women in West Africa by freeing up time – their scarcest resource – and enabling them to sell higher value products at market more often, thus increasing their income and improving lives,’ said Rajiv Shah, director of agricultural development, Global Development Program at the foundation. ‘Through this effort, we hope to learn whether these platforms could reach an even larger number of communities in Africa.’ The initiative is also expected to contribute to the objectives of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) regional energy access policy to meet the MDGs, which aims to provide rural and peri-urban populations with energy services including mechanical power for agro-processing. It is hoped that the lessons learned will serve as the basis to expand the approach across sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 100 million people in rural areas could benefit.Source: UNDP Newsroom, 25 February 2008.  </p>

In adopting a joint resolution on the importance of supporting measures to improve international scientific cooperation with Africa, the European Parliament underlines the need to increase the involvement of African scientists in international collaborative science and R&amp;D projects in order to keep and develop R&amp;D knowledge in Africa, in particular in specific sectors such as food, health and energy. The House acknowledges the increasing trend amongst policy-makers in Africa to prioritise science and technology (S&amp;T) and innovation for development. MEPs recognise the valuable contribution of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), its S&amp;T consolidated action plan and the S&amp;T programmes of the African Union, and calls for better implementation and fuller development thereof and for the relevant measures to be improved. Parliament recalls the special relevance given to neglected diseases within the 7th Research Framework Programme and considers that special emphasis should be placed on research into AIDS in African countries. The House calls for the reinforcement of existing research infrastructure in accordance with the indications of the African Union and the African scientific community, including the NEPAD Office for Science and Technology, programmes of the African Union and R&amp;D projects, in particular in specific sectors such as food, health and energy.

					<p> 
The urgency to restore soil fertility in Africa stems from the fact that more than three-quarters of the farmland in sub-Saharan Africa has been so depleted of the basic nutrients that crops need to survive, leading to reduced crop yields. The soils are also low in organic matter and have poor water holding capacity. Experts warn that until these conditions are reversed, food production in Africa will remain depressed. They also say that unsustainable land practices are contributing to massive erosion and deforestation. Driven to meet the food demands of a growing population, African farmers have steadily abandoned traditional practices that restore soil nutrients. It is estimated that continuous cultivation without soil revitalisation causes the loss of eight million tonnes of soil nutrients each year. In the past, traditional farming practices maintained soil fertility by allowing fields to lie fallow for a few years. But population growth and pressure on land have led to a sharp decline in fallowing. Today, fallowing is practised on less than 25% of land in 29 African countries and is expected to disappear entirely from 20 of them in the near future. There is an art and science to the efficient and environmentally responsible combination of fertilisers, organic inputs and cropping techniques to get a maximum return on investment. Finding the right combinations requires good farmer knowledge and technical knowledge. Source: African Agriculture, 5 February 2008.  </p>

					<p> 
Climate change could cause severe crop losses in South Asia and southern Africa over the next 20 years, a study in the journal Science says. The findings suggest southern Africa could lose more than 30% of its main crop, maize, by 2030. In South Asia losses of many regional staples, such as rice, millet and maize could top 10%, the report says. The effects in these two regions could be catastrophic without effective measures to adapt to climate change. The majority of the world’s one billion poor depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Yet, says lead author David Lobell, from Stanford University in California, US, it is also ‘the human enterprise most vulnerable to climate change. Understanding where these climate threats will be greatest, for what crops and on what timescales, will be central to our efforts at fighting hunger and poverty over the coming decades.’ Since it typically takes 15 to 30 years for major agricultural investments to be fully realised, work must start soon to help subsistence farmers increase their yields or switch crops, the study says. While relatively inexpensive changes, such as switching crops or altering planting seasons, could trim the losses, ‘the biggest benefits will likely result from more costly measures, including the development of new crop varieties and expansion of irrigation’.Source: BBC, 31 January 2008.  </p>
