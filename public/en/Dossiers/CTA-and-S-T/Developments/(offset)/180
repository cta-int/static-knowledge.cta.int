						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Using an advanced form of X-ray imaging, researchers from the University of Nottingham, in collaboration with several international research groups, discovered that the presence of even small amounts of water can influence the structure of plant roots in soil. The degree of root branching determines the efficiency of water uptake and acquisition of nutrients by plants. Any new understanding of the regulation of root branching is of vital importance, and this finding could open up new ways of improving the water and nutrient foraging qualities of important food crops and hence could significantly improve crop yields. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(University of Nottingham website, 3/06/2014)</p>

					<p>Florence Wambugu and Daniel Kamanga of Africa Harvest Biotech Foundation International, Kenya, brought together a large number of African experts from fields as diverse as economics, agriculture, biotechnology, law and politics and asked them to review various biotechnology initiatives in Africa. In this book, available both as e-book and hard cover edition, the experts argue that there is a great future for biotechnology that sidesteps Western interests that do not necessarily match those of Africa. They demand a greater say in how research and development funds are allocated and spent, and ask for more elbow-room for Africa’s political leaders to drive the development of feasible policies, suitable biosafety legislation and regulation, and to respond effectively to public-private partnerships. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(Springer website, July 2014)</p>

					<p>More consistent treatment of climate change adaptation is needed to inform assessments of the impacts of climate change and to more easily identify innovations in agriculture that are truly more effective in future climates than in current or past ones. At present, many potential changes in agricultural management and technology, including shifts in crop phenology and improved drought and heat tolerance, could help to improve crop productivity but do not necessarily represent true adaptations. In this article, David Lobell of Stanford University, USA, argues that such ‘adaptation illusions’ arise from a combination of faulty logic, model errors and the management of assumptions that ignore the farmers’ tendency to maximize profits for a given technology. He asserts that the concept of adaptation should be more consistently treated in order to better inform assessments of climate change impacts, and that agricultural innovations should be identified that are truly more effective in future climates than in current or past ones. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Global Food Security</i>, 25/6/2014)</p>

					<p>In discussions of the impacts of climate change on agriculture, it is often mistakenly argued that most of the expected impacts will occur toward the end of this century and that therefore most of the risks will have to be dealt with by future generations. In this article, Claudia Tebaldi, National Center for Atmospheric Research, USA, and David Lobell, Stanford University, USA, argue that the growth in demand for food is expected to be much slower after 2050 than before it, and that most of the growth will take place before 2050 – in the next two decades, in fact. They explain that smaller climate change impacts in the near future could have much greater consequences for food security and food prices than larger ones after 2050. They continue to argue that in the coming decade, global warming will substantially increase the chances that climate trends will cut yield growth rates to half, with a roughly 1 in 4 chance for maize and 1 in 6 chance for wheat. Although such scenarios may seem unlikely for many, the authors recommend further study, particularly by institutions that are potentially affected by associated steep rises in international food prices. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Environmental Research Letters</i>, Vol. 9 no. 7, July 2014)</p>

					<p>New technology for monitoring tuna fishing in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean is being tested on two large Chinese tuna longliners under the Taipei flag. The e-monitoring system uses high-definition video cameras, GPS and a central computer unit to record all events and video footage and with which the information gathered can be analyzed by experienced longline fishing experts and observers. As part of this test, the e-monitoring results will be compared with information collected by two independent fisheries observers who were assigned to each vessel to carry out their regular tasks of observing and recording the catch. The project partners are Tri Marine, National Fisheries Developments (NFD), Yi Man Fishing Company, Satlink, FFA, SPC, Solomon Islands Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources (MFMR) and the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation (ISSF). They presented preliminary findings of this test at the meeting of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission’s annual Scientific Committee to be held in Majuro in August 2014. Implementing e-monitoring technology in all or parts of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean fisheries will require logistical and legal frameworks to be put in place at national and regional levels. &nbsp; &nbsp;(SPC, July 2014)</p>

	CTA will support the documentation of proven practices, policies and ICTs that contribute to increased productivity and resilience of agriculture under changing climate in ACP regions. The Centre is particularly interested in interventions that have the potential to contribute to cross-learning among ACP countries and could be scaled up for the benefit of farmers and stakeholders in the regions. The practices, policies and ICTs should be documented in such a way as to provide practical information that will be useful to different stakeholders- farmers, researchers and students, extension workers, development agencies, policy makers. <b>Closing date: 14 October 2014</b></p>

					<p>Ian Scoones, at Future Agricultures, reviews the literature on ‘sustainable intensification’ (SI) in particular at what differentiate the concept of 'sustainable agriculture' from the one of 'sustainable intensification', only to find a 'crisis' narrative. Scoones notes that a social and political analysis is absent, a fact that undermines the approach. He concludes: 'For SI to be anything more than a rather odd collection of technical solutions, the questions of socio-technical choice and direction must be put at the forefront. This means having a political debate, and bringing in people more centrally, something that may jar with the rather bland techno-economic prescriptions offered to date.' &nbsp; &nbsp;(Futures Agricultures, 16/06/2014)</p>

					<p>Guiding principles for communicating scientific findings in a manner that promotes objectivity, public trust, and policy relevance have been proposed by Kevin C. Elliott (Michigan State University, US) and David B. Resnik (National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, US) . These are based on current ethical, conceptual, and empirical studies of objectivity and conflicts of interest in scientific research. Both conceptual and empirical studies of scientific reasoning have shown that it is unrealistic to prevent policy-relevant scientific research from being influenced by value judgments. Conceptually, the current dispute over an EC report on its regulatory policy for endocrine-disrupting chemicals illustrates how scientists were forced to make value judgments about appropriate standards of evidence when informing public policy. Empirical studies provide further evidence that scientists are unavoidably influenced by a variety of potentially subconscious financial, social, political, and personal interests. The authors conclude that when scientific evidence is inconclusive and major regulatory decisions are at stake, it is unrealistic to think that values can be excluded from scientific reasoning. Thus, efforts to suppress or hide interests or values may actually damage scientific objectivity and public trust, whereas a willingness to bring implicit interests and values into the open may be the best path to promoting good science and policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Environmental Health Perspectives</i>, 01/ 07/2014)</p>

The results were surprising and put into question the standard methodology that agricultural scientists commonly use to assess the success of the introduction of new agricultural technologies. Toro sums it up: 'In the open RCT, Tanzanian cowpea farmers who knew they were getting improved seed easily outperformed farmers who knew they were getting traditional seed. But in the double-blind study, farmers who weren’t told whether the seed they got was improved or not performed just as well whether that the seed they received was improved or traditional. In fact, farmers who used traditional seed without knowing it did just as well as farmers who used improved seed, whether they knew it or not. Only farmers who knew the seed they were given wasn’t improved lagged behind in productivity.' &nbsp;&nbsp;(Francisco Toro's blog, 09/04/2014)</p>

					<p>Integrated pest management (IPM) has hardly been adopted in developing countries, despite its theoretical prominence and sound principles. These are the findings of a research project conducted by scientists from CIAT, IRD, CIP, University of Greenwich, Cornell University and Wageningen UR. They found 51 potential reasons why IPM adoption by developing country farmers is low. The most frequently mentioned obstacle was 'insufficient training and technical support to farmers'. Different adoption obstacles were identified than in high-income countries. Developing-country respondents rated 'IPM requires collective action within a farming community' as their top obstacle to IPM adoption. Respondents from high-income countries prioritised the 'shortage of well-qualified IPM experts and extension workers'. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/02/19/1312693111 " target="_self">http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/02/19/1312693111</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences </i>and IRD (FR), 25/02/2014)</p>

					<p>In early 2014, MS Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) in India conducted the 23rd Annual Dialogue series. The focus of the Dialogue was to provide important inputs to the Regulatory Authority Bill that is before the Indian Parliament for the approval and commercialisation of genetically modified crops. The Foundation brought together all stakeholders in the agriculture sector, including molecular biologists, plant breeders, farmers’ associations and civil society representatives from both national and international institutions, to help produce definite guidelines. Seven key recommendations emerged, in particular: Well-designed needs assessment to facilitate decisions on publicly funded GM research; decisions should be based on the precautionary principle; genetic literacy at the grassroots level about GM crops; hidden hunger and the micronutrient deficiency can be largely eliminated by integrating nutritionally rich crops and plants and promoting nutri-farms or homestead gardens. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Agriculture &amp; Food Security</i>, 12/05/2014)</p>

					<p>This paper by Hannes Dempewolf and colleagues of the Global Crop Diversity Trust, Germany, and the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, UK, informs researchers interested in the 'Adapting Agriculture to Climate Change' initiative and to encourage them to start collaborating under its umbrella. The authors explain that the main objective of the project is to collect and protect the genetic diversity of a range of plants with characteristics that are required for adapting the world's most important food crops to climate change. The initiative also makes these plants available to plant breeders who can readily use them to produce varieties adapted to the new climatic conditions. &nbsp; &nbsp;Editor’s note: What mechanisms are in place to ensure equal access to the genetic diversity collected and that countries derive economic and social benefits from any sale or profits from their indigenous resources? &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems</i>, 18/02/2014)</p>

					<p>Kram-kram (cram-cram) is the edible and highly nutritious grain from <i>Cenchrus biflorus</i>, a perennial grass. The grain is rich in protein and has perhaps the highest calorie content of any grain, but today it is only collected when the harvests of other grains are insufficient to feed the community. The Tuareg people in Mali traditionally collect Kram-kram as a wild cereal. To be used, the seeds need to be hulled in a mortar, extracting the white grain from its spiny covering. The grains can be pounded and eaten raw, made into porridge, or mixed and cooked with other foods. During the rainy season, the plant can be harvested more than once. It can be preserved in traditional silos, where fermentation softens the spines enough so that it can be eaten by animals. Kram-kram grass grows very well in the sand and needs little water. Many more underused species for agriculture and food production can be found on the online database 'The Ark of Taste'. &nbsp;(Slow Food Foundation for Biodiversity, 2014)</p>
