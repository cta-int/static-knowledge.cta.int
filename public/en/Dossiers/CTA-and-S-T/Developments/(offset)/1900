						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

Gender is an important dimension in all of the thematic areas but there are visible knowledge gaps pertaining to the influence and impacts of gender in innovation systems and processes. This call aims to examine gender from a wider perspective of innovation systems in developing countries. It will support research towards understanding impediments to innovation processes being influenced by women, opportunities to promote greater involvement and influence by women and the differential impacts (real and perceived) of existing innovation systems on women. Proposals are invited in the form of concept notes following the template available at <a href="http://www.idrc.ca/gender_and_innovation" target="_blank">this website</a>. Closing date is 19 December 2008.</p>

					<p>African countries are concerned about their ability to meet their olibigations for the Cartegena Protocol on Biosafety. Since the fourth meeting of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, concluded in Bonn, Germany earlier this year, preparations are underway for the next major meeting (COP-MOP5) to be held in Nagoya, Japan in 2010. Over 140 countries have now signed up to the Protocol but there are concerns, particularly amongst African countries, about their capacity to implement the guidelines. African delegates have also called for greater funding and support to strengthen their negotiating powers prior to meetings in Nagoya, and to improve the currently poor reporting progress within the region. However, there is still concern that most African countries lack the human and technical capacity to implement the Protocol and to fulfil the BCH requirements. In particular, African scientists have stated that negotiators are particularly ill-prepared to discuss Article 27 of the Protocol on liability and redress (Source: Zablon Odhiambo, New Agriculturalist, September 2008). </p>

					<p>The head of the BIOTA South steering committee in South Africa, Dr. John Donaldson, speaks about the chances of conservation in agricultural areas and the threats of land use, climate change, and invasive species. Prof John Donaldson, 49, is the head of Applied Biodiversity Research at the South African National Biodiversity Institute, and chairs the steering committee for BIOTA activities in South Africa. Among other issues, his scientific work aims to determine whether combining the needs of humans and nature can provide benefits for conservation. The South African ecologist and conservation biologist is convinced that such an approach is necessary for sustainable development – 'the interaction between production and conservation has many facets, some good, some bad, but we are most likely to balance production and conservation if natural assets also have value from an economical point of view' (Source: Biota Africa, 25 September 2008).</p>

					<p>A study by the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa) has allayed fears that introducing genetic technology in agriculture may lead to market losses. It indicates that even should such products be rejected, the decline in exports from the three East African countries would be insignificant. The study says there is little justification in the precautionary stance taken by countries, ostensibly in the conviction that they are preserving their trade interests and niche markets. GM varieties of these commodities have not been developed and commercialised anywhere and so far there has been little commercial interest to develop them. The study analysed the value and volume of agricultural food and feed exports by African countries to various regions of the world including the EU (Source:Bernard Muthaka, The Citizen, 24 September 2008).</p>

					<p>Fisheries researchers have successfully bred three fish species in captivity, which are threatened by extinction in local lakes and rivers. The fish, labeo victorianus, commonly called ningu, barbus altianaris (kisinja) and the male African cat fish are threatened by extinction because of water pollution by factories, farming along the shores and capturing of immature fish. The introduction of exotic fish species like the Nile Perch, which is a predator, also threatened their existence. &quot;The ningu and kisinja breed in fast-flowing waters. During the rainy season, they tend to move to swamps to breed,&quot; said Godfrey Kityo, a researcher at the National Fisheries Resources Research Institute. However, fishermen lay traps, capturing the fish before they lay eggs (New Vision, 23 September 2008).</p>

Mr Ban explained that investing in agriculture including small scale farmers was &quot;literally a life and death issue&quot; for millions around the world. Many countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, lag behind in their attempts to achieve the anti-poverty targets known as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015, he said (Source:Michael Appel, BuaNews, 23 September 2008).</p>

					<p>Uganda's agricultural production could drop unless the government revises existing policies, putting at risk the livelihoods of 75 per cent of the country's population, farmers have warned. Data from the Uganda National Farmers' Federation shows that the continued neglect of the sector has meant to a 1.9 per cent growth over the past two years, which was a 0.6 per cent drop over the 2004 and 2005 figure. &quot;This is because of the unarticulated policies and institutional frameworks that are leading to a decline in agricultural production,&quot; farmers said during a recent national public hearing on agricultural policy issues facing smallholder farmers (Source: Eve Mashoo, The East African, 20 September 2008).</p>

					<p>A joint FAO and Uganda’s Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries project has helped over 3 000 farmers combat a pestilent disease that threatened to wipe out production of cooking banana, a staple crop upon which 14 million Ugandans depend for food and income. Two years ago, the two began setting up Farmer Field Schools in five pilot districts where the disease was either endemic or appearing in limited foci. The aim was to help local growers acquire hands-on knowledge in how to prevent the disease from occurring and spreading. The results have been remarkable.

					<p>Political representatives from 21 cities around the world have signed a declaration to protect and re-develop urban biodiversity in their towns. Each city committed to identifying five vital initiatives to conserve plants, animals and natural resources and put those plans into practice within the next 18 months. From Africa, the Namibian town of Walvis Bay and four South African municipalities -- Cape Town, Durban, Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni -- are part of the Local Action for Biodiversity (LAB) project, which was kicked off in 2006 at the Sustainability World Congress by the International council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI). Each participating city will select five projects to enhance biodiversity according to its particular natural environment. &quot;The strategy and action plans are different for each city because northern and southern cities have very different needs,&quot; explains Kobie Brand, regional director of ICLEI Africa (Source: Kristin Palitza, IPS, 15 September 2008). </p>

					<p>NETWORKING technology company Cisco will invest R215m over the next five years to set up a training centre and incubation hub for young technicians. The centre will be built on land at the government-backed Innovation Hub in Pretoria and will have a specific focus on increasing the skills pool for communications technologies. Cisco SA MD Steve Midgley said the aims included supporting local software development, training network engineers and creating state-of-the-art laboratories for communications technologies. Once the centre was running, it would become a showcase that venture capitalists could tour to see if they were interested in backing any of the initiatives (Source: Lesley Stones , Business Day (Johannesburg), 15 September 2008).</p>
