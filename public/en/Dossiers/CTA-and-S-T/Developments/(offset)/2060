						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

In this interview, Regassa Feyissa talks about the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), the fallacy of food aid, knowledge systems in relation to traditional versus scientific and the need to create alternatives to AGRA. Dr. Regassa Feyissa is the co-founder and Director of the Ethio-Organic Seed Action (EOSA). EOSA is leading a program on Agro-bio diversity in Ethiopia - with the goal of restoring and preserving genetic diversity. Africa is a very rich continent in terms of ecological systems, farming systems, and production systems. Culture and preferences also vary across the continent. It is not a continent to which you can apply a standardized application as has been done in Asia and even Europe. I was surprised to read that AGRA has over 200 crop varieties ready to be used in Africa. But what varieties of crops are they going to bring to Africa? As Mexico provided maize to the world, Africa provided sorghum. Sorghum resisted destruction from the first green revolution because it is such an energetic crop. It adapts itself anywhere from 400 meters to 6,000 meters. The first green revolution and its standardized systems could not match sorghum. Sorghum is distributed across various ecological requirements. For the last 50 years or so we have been talking about rice, maize and to some extent wheat. Maize was introduced in Africa 500 years ago. We have rice for more than 1000 years, which is still more stable. We have different root crops, and different cereals which are forgotten because of the colonial system of forcing its own wills and wishes – thereby destroying and pushing out African resources. But still some of the crops resisted and Africans are still living on them. So what crops will AGRA bring in, is what interests me and I am surprised about the 200 varieties. Why were African farmers not consulted?Source: Pambazuka News, 10 April 2008. </p>

Kenya is set to roll out a bio-diesel master plan it hopes will help it cut its kerosene consumption by half and significantly reduce its diesel usage in the next three years. Energy economists said the plan could initially help the country save Sh3.4 billion annually. The plan comes at a time when petroleum prices have risen to unprecedented levels in the global market, fuelling inflation and leaving huge import bills in the hands of net importers such as Kenya. Crude oil price touched the $109 per barrel mark for the first time in the history of oil trading, signaling a steep rise in pump prices in the next few months. The impact of high oil prices is expected to be particularly high on low-income households where paraffin is the main source of energy for lighting and cooking.Source: African Executive, 9 April 2008.  </p>

‘Eating sweet potatoes and tea for breakfast is a sign of poverty. To show improved status; one has to have tea, milk and buttered bread here in the village.’ During my research days in Mutomo (an arid part of Eastern Kenya) farmers would point out that they were so poor that they had to eat ‘namba;’ a fruit from the Baobab tree. Africa’s indigenous foods and fruits are vanishing from the scene due either to changing dietary habits or little use of technology to sustain them. Besides the mindset that has eroded the African thirst for indigenous foods such as millet, sorghum, marula, tamarind and ebony, among others, disregard of technological advancements has made it difficult for indigenous crops to survive the onslaught from global counterparts (maize, wheat, mangoes, pawpaw, etc.) that were introduced by explorers and colonialists. Why are our scientists spending so little time researching and commercializing indigenous plant varieties that are suited to Africa’s climate? African farmers have several battle fronts: unpredictable climate, depleted soils, bad science and ‘cultists’ keen to maintain the status quo on the continent. A bad check on technology has been handed to us by some friends from wealthy countries. Consequently, we cannot feed our children. For Kenya and by extension Africa to gain first world status, we must judiciously embrace technology as part of our strategy to feed ourselves. Through technological advancement, our farmers can respond to the present market stimuli that clearly indicates a high demand for agricultural produce. Strengthened financial and political institutions coupled with sound science will feed our people.Source: African Executive, 9 April 2008.  </p>

Interview with Achim Steiner, executive director of UNEP. Representatives from countries, civil society and the private sector are meeting this week in Johannesburg, South Africa, to review the findings of the International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD). This global initiative has examined agriculture from all angles, to determine how farming might be done more sustainably in the future. At the opening plenary of the meeting, Achim Steiner addressed delegates about the need for new agricultural strategies. Acknowledging that certain changes might be difficult to embark on, Steiner nonetheless called on delegates to ‘Draw inspiration from South Africa to do something that no one thought was possible ... take on the difficult challenge of walking forward together.’Source: IPS, 9 April 2008.  </p>

					<p> 
Tanzania’s government plans to enter into a 10-year public-private partnership on drought-tolerant maize varieties for small-scale farmers. The partnership was launched in response to a growing call by African farmers, leaders and scientists to address devastating effects of drought on small-scale farmers and their families. Agriculture and Technology researcher in the Ministry of Agriculture, Dr Alais Kullaya, is quoted in a local daily as saying the initiative is aimed at alleviating hunger and poverty. Kullaya said that new drought-tolerance technologies have already been licensed without charge and can be developed, tested, and eventually distributed to African seed companies without royalty and made available to smallholder farmers. He said that the transgenic drought-tolerant maize hybrids would be available in about ten years. Risk of crop failure from drought is one of the primary reasons that made small-scale farmers in Africa not adopt improved farming practices. The project would involve local institutions, both public and private, and in the process expand their capacity and experience in crop breeding, biotechnology, and biosafety, according to the ministry researcher. The programme partners predict that maize products developed over the next 10 years could increase yields by 20 to 35 percent under moderate drought, compared to current varieties. In the next five years, the partnership will develop new maize varieties, incorporating the best drought-tolerance technologies available internationally.

	Close to 200 policymakers, researchers, and representatives from the private sector, farmers’ organizations, and other civil society groups gathered in the beginning of April for an international conference in Addis Ababa, organized by IFPRI, to discuss technological, institutional, and organizational innovations that are transforming agriculture, reducing poverty and hunger, and improving people’s lives. In many countries, development is blocked by inappropriate agricultural technologies, serious problems with the organization and management of agricultural systems, and immense institutional constraints, including insufficient human and financial resources. In spite of this, there are many examples of technological, institutional, and organizational innovations that are transforming agriculture and leading to growth and development. Important lessons that can be learned and scaled up from the successes that are occurring, as well as from examining cases that did not work.

Chinese investors, who have lately gained a strong presence in Kenya’s telecoms and heavy industry, are now eyeing the country’s farmland as a source of useful raw materials and employment opportunities. Several thousand acres of land outside Nairobi are unused and could be turned into farms planted with wheat, corn and pineapples, says Liu Jianjun, chairman of the China-Africa Baoding Business Council, an organisation that sets up negotiations with African governments for Chinese investments. He also wants to open a new cornflour processing factory in Kenya and raise donkeys on the grassland to supply donkey hides that can be turned into Chinese medicines. The plans are far from approval. Kenya is still not open enough to foreign investors, explained Mr Liu, but he is determined for China to get more than just minerals out of African earth. Chinese farmers can also earn a living off the continent’s farmland, he says. Widespread industrialisation in China has already encouraged millions of farmers to migrate to cities to take up factory jobs. But there are not enough jobs to go round for the millions more that will lose their land when rapidly developing cities swallow up still more farms. The solution is an easy one. Chinese farmers should move to Africa where frequent food shortages would reward those with modern farming techniques, says Mr Liu. ‘Lots of land in Kenya is not farmed and yet it still receives food aid from the UN. At the same time, China faces a shortage of farmland,’ he said. Chinese farmers have already been successful in Uganda which has leased an area of about 10,000 acres to around 300-400 Chinese. They grow corn and other crops and employ hundreds of local workers. Now the business council wants to replicate its success in Kenya. It claims that Chinese farms in Africa benefit local communities. A plot of 10,000 acres would require 5,000 local workers. As well as creating jobs, Chinese farmers bring know-how and modern machinery, such as small tractors that can cope with hilly terrain, says Liu. ‘We also have good quality seeds with several times the same output as Kenyan seeds.’ Li Zhu, chief of one of the Chinese ‘villages’ in Uganda, seems sincere when he conveys how China can help local agriculture. ‘Uganda is similar to the way China was in the 1980s. We can help them by showing them how to avoid the dead ends that China took during its development. We can show them what works.’ Source: Business Daily Africa, 6 April 2008.  </p>

					<p> 
With soaring food prices expected to continue for the foreseeable future, the World Bank is calling for a ‘new deal’ of long-term measures, ranging from increased investment in African agriculture to genetically engineering fuel-producing plants. Aid organisations are already confronting growing financial shortfalls in their struggle to feed the world’s hungry as food prices have exploded over the past six months, propelled by increased demand from newly prosperous Asian countries like China, rising fuel prices and the diversion of land from food crops to bio-fuel production. The problem extends way beyond usual temporary production blips like the recent Australian drought, the volatility of soaring oil prices and a falling dollar, and could be severely compounded by climate change – with harsher droughts in some parts of the world and more severe flooding in others predicted. In a worst case scenario not only could mortality and disease from malnutrition, already the underlying cause of an estimated 3.5 million child deaths each year, soar, but widespread social and political unrest might erupt. Food riots have already been reported in several countries and the World Bank estimates that 33 nations face potential social unrest. ‘For these countries, where food comprises from half to three-quarters of consumption [spending], there is no margin for survival,’ says World Bank President Robert B. Zoellick, calling for a ‘new deal’ combining hundreds of millions of additional dollars for immediate relief with long-term efforts to boost agricultural productivity in developing countries. He announced that the Bank would nearly double agricultural assistance to US$800 million in Africa, adding: ‘We can help create a ‘Green Revolution’ for sub-Saharan Africa.’ Just last month the UN World Food Programme (WFP) issued an ‘extraordinary emergency appeal’ to world leaders for an additional $500 million over the $2.9 billion it sought a few months ago, just to feed the same 73 million people in 78 countries.

The Philippines-based International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and the Benin-based Africa Rice Center (WARDA) have launched the African component of a research initiative that aims to provide smallholder farmers with new rice varieties. The African project is being made possible by the Gates Foundation in the U.S. It aims to provide smallholder farmers who rely on rain-fed agriculture with improved rice varieties and farm management practices to increase yields by 50% over the next ten years. ‘In these regions, farmers are always getting yields which are only one or two tons per hectare, when normally they could get up to five tons per hectare or even more,’ says plant breeder Baboucarr Manneh of the Africa Rice Center’s Biotechnology Unit. The idea of the project, Manneh says, ‘is to develop rice varieties, distribute the seeds of these varieties and make sure they’re available to all farmers.’ Work will be carried out in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Nigeria, and Tanzania to design rice varieties best-suited to each country. The project is part of a larger scheme at IRRI, funded by the Gates Foundation, to improve rice varieties in Africa and Asia.Source: SciDev.Net, 4 April 2008.  </p>

					<p> 
By its very nature, jatropha is divisive. The poisonous, deep-rooted shrub is traditionally used as hedging to protect food crops from hungry animals. Now it has a new purpose, and this time it’s dividing opinion. Some say it can help solve the world’s fuel crisis, others say there are too many uncertainties to call it a sure bet, while environmentalists have another set of reasons again for objecting to its large-scale production. Jatropha seeds can be crushed to extract oil that makes a high-quality biodiesel. The question is whether enough oil can be derived from large-scale plantations to make the product economically viable. Concrete figures on productivity and seed oil yields are at best limited and those that are available often contradict stated projections. This is especially the case in marginal conditions, where jatropha is supposed to prove its worth. Jatropha’s deep root system allows it to grow on marginal land. And, unlike traditional biofuel crops of soy, corn, canola and palm oil, it’s poisonous, rendering the argument of food versus fuel irrelevant. ‘Jatropha is being promoted as a wonder crop but that’s actually not true,’ says Kenneth Richter, of Friends of the Earth. ‘Jatropha can grow on relatively poor soils, but obviously it grows far better on good soils. What we see in Africa is that western companies are going in and buying up large amounts of land from the farmers.’ He says the plant is being introduced to areas where it’s not native, threatening local wildlife. Once it’s been planted, it’s there to stay. ‘It’s difficult to get rid of once you’ve grown the plants; it’s basically a weed in some countries.’ Harry Boyle, analyst at New Energy Finance says his team won’t be convinced of the potential of jatropha until it sees firm figures on the table. ‘Until you see a one million hectare plantation producing regular amounts of jatropha crude year after year then it’s hard to see how quickly the jatropha industry will progress.’ That could be some time away. Many of the seeds that were planted in the rush to gain first mover advantage in what producers say could be a very lucrative field are still years away from maturity. What is agreed right now is that there’s very little scientific information about large-scale production of jatropha oil. While analysts and cautious investors are content to wait for the plant to prove its worth, for producers and speculators there’s no time to waste. Source: CNN, 1 April 2008.  </p>

					<p> 
The Sahel, a vast area stretching from Senegal and Mauritania on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean in the west, to Eritrea in the east, is predominantly sand. The Sahel was once grassland and savanna, with areas of woodlands and shrubs. However, clearing of perennial vegetation by farmers to allow cultivation of the soil, combined with grazing and utilisation of crop residues, has exposed the sandy soil to wind and water erosion and caused the land to become degraded. An initiative to use hardy trees, which grow well in poor soils while yielding a commercially viable product, is the foundation for a regional bioreclamation initiative being promoted by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and partners in western and central Africa. The bioreclamation of degraded lands (BDL) is based on water harvesting techniques for the production of high value crops. Three years of on-station and on-farm research by ICRISAT scientists, joined by a researcher from the World Vegetable Centre (AVRDC), has resulted in the creation of a highly versatile and promising system that exploits all the advantages of the laterite layer over the sandy soil for income generation. The BDL system is still in its infancy and further investigations will be carried out. However, the demand for the approach is high and this year, some 30 BDL plots will be planted in various regions of Niger, impacting on the livelihoods of 1,000 households. If the pilot plantations succeed, the BDL system could provide a means of reclaiming vast areas of unusable land, improving household security, while mitigating the impacts of climate change.Source: New Agriculturalist, March 2008.  </p>

					<p> 
Agricultural growth in sub-Saharan Africa is vital to poverty reduction and to the achievement of the MDGs. Despite its importance, however, investments in agricultural water have seen a continuous decline since the late 1980s, with only a slight recovery in recent years. In response to the decline, five international organizations (the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the FAO, the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the International Water Management Institute) have joined forces on a new agricultural water strategy prepared for NEPAD. Agricultural water includes irrigation on large and small schemes and farms, drainage of irrigated and rain-fed areas, watershed restoration, recycled water use, rainwater harvesting, and all in-field water management practices. The Initiative for Agricultural Water in Africa, or AgWA, looks at the effects of agricultural water management on poverty reduction, the reasons for its slow expansion and the ways in which increased investment in agricultural water management could make a sustainable contribution to poverty reduction and economic growth. ‘Strategic public and related private investment in water management will be essential for the intensification of agricultural production and for meeting targets for poverty alleviation, food production and economic recovery by 2015,’ said Richard Mkandawire, agricultural advisor to NEPAD, which has called for the implementation of land and water management in sub-Saharan Africa. ‘Reliance on irregular and unreliable rainfall for agricultural production is a major constraint on crop productivity in the region.’ The five institutions met in Tunis, Tunisia, in March during the first annual African Water Week, organized by the ADB. The initiative hopes to provide a platform to support agricultural water in the region and will bring together financing instruments including loans, grants and other multilateral and bilateral funding in order to aid governments in improving water management.Source: World Bank press release, 28 March, 2008.  </p>

					<p> 
Experts agree that an estimated 35% of land that was cultivatable 50 years ago is now desert in 11 of Nigeria’s northern states, but what they are not so sure about is why. ‘These are indications of global warming which the world must grapple with,’ Igiri West, a Kano-based environmentalist told IRIN. ‘The level of industrial and vehicular emissions [in industrialised countries] is so high that they are capable of drastically affecting the climate [in northern Nigeria].’ But Kabiru Yammama of the National Forest Conservation Council of Nigeria disagrees: ‘Deforestation constitutes 75% of the environmental problems in northern Nigeria,’ he said. ‘The increasing need for wood fuel for domestic use has caused the rapid depleting of trees which has … caused increasing havoc on the environment and put farming activities at great risk,’ he said. Yammama said the population burns over 40.5 million tonnes of firewood each year which destroys over 400,000 hectares of forest. Environmental activists have been lobbying the government to create a Desert Control Commission and pass a federal bill to address desertification, but parliament has not yet taken action.

The continent’s top science policy bodies have agreed on a plan to overcome their differences and avoid duplication in the future. The move follows a period of conflict between the two that has hampered the implementation of the pan-African Consolidated Plan of Action (CPA) for science. The breakthrough came at a meeting in South Africa attended by representatives from the African Union’s human resources, science and technology department (HRST) and Nepad’s science and technology secretariat. The two fell out spectacularly last year, with HRST accusing Nepad of having failed to consult on a project to measure the quality and quantity of science and innovation in Africa. Nepad was pushing ahead with the African Science, Technology and Innovation Indicators (Astii) project, with financial support from Sida. Meanwhile, the HRST had been working with Unesco on a different project to develop African science indicators. The row was thrust into the limelight at the meeting of science ministers in Mombasa, Kenya, in November 2007. At the time, Bothlale Tema, former director of the HRST department, called for the ‘issue to be resolved—not to cause World War III’. The chequered relationship between HRST and Nepad has ‘seriously affected’ the implementation of the CPA, says HRST director Hakim Elwaer. His office is proposing that African science policy actors form a ‘cluster’ to coordinate their efforts on the continent. ‘The cluster would bring together all players in the S&amp;T field in Africa, including continental and international partners, in order to harmonise work plans and eliminate wastefulness of resources and duplication of efforts,’ he said. The idea will be presented to the bureau of the African Ministerial Council of Science and Technology (Amcost) at a meeting in April in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This month’s meeting also saw the African Union (AU) and Nepad clarify their distinct roles in implementing the CPA. Nepad will provide technical leadership, while HRST will provide policy leadership. A coordinating working group to monitor progress will meet in Nairobi, Kenya, also in April. A joint committee has been established to harmonise Nepad’s science indicator activities with those of HRST. Mohamed Hassan, executive director of the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World (Twas), called the idea ‘an important step’. However, he added, a number of organisations are developing science policies for their activities in Africa, and he was not sure the cluster on its own would be enough to avoid overlaps. Hassan said the Network for African Science Academies (Nasac) was preparing a report on how to coordinate science strategies on the continent. Source: Research Africa, 25 March 2008.  </p>

					<p> 
Botswana is to commence construction of its first International University of Science and Technology (BIUST) early June. BIUST project coordinator, Ms Badumetse Hobona said they are finalizing the tendering process and construction will commence in June this year. The university is intended to direct the country’s human resources towards science and technology and produce a skilled and competent workforce that will facilitate technology transfer. The university, expected to open in March 2010, will offer courses such as evolutionary genetics, forensic chemistry, human computer interactions, industrial mathematics, applied nuclear physics, insurance and investment fund management. Ms Hobona said they decided to start the linkages at the development phase through public private-partnership opportunities. This, she hopes will enhance efficient delivery of public infrastructure and services by accessing private sector innovation, managerial, technical skills and expertise. This partnership will also include mentoring of students by private companies engaging in strong research ideas that could be developed into profitable production entities. BIUST already has 27 staff fellows pursuing postgraduate studies. The first intake is expected to be 150 students. Source: Africa Science News Service, 25 March 2008.  </p>

Nigeria has inaugurated an International Scientific Committee to fast track the contributions of science to national development. Spokesman of the National Mathematical Centre (NMC), Njoku Onyekachi, said that the body inaugurated by the Minister of Education, Dr IgweAja-Nwachukwu, would be an advisory body to the Centre. Aja-Nwachukwu was quoted by the statement, issued yesterday in Abuja, as saying that successive governments were responsible for the brain drain syndrome affecting the country following their failure to invest in science and research. The minister said that the committee was part of a strategy adopted by the present government to correct the mistakes of the past and position the country to attain the vision 2020.

The Secretariat of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) has recently entered into two new partnership agreements. On 7 March 2008, UNCCD and the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), signed a Memorandum of Understanding, through which they will address a number of issues, including science, technology, knowledge management, capacity building, financing and technology transfer, advocacy, awareness raising and education. They will also work with African Ministers of Finance, Planning and Economic Development in mainstreaming issues of land degradation, desertification and drought in national sustainable development strategies, poverty reduction strategy papers and other sectoral and cross-sectoral policies and programmes. The Secretariat recently hosted a meeting organized by CGIAR Centers ICARDA (International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas) and ICRISAT (International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics) to finalize a global proposal for a science program to combat agriculturally caused dryland degradation and desertification. <a href="http://www.oasisglobal.net" target="_blank">The Oasis Challenge Program</a>, will be submitted to the CGIAR Science Council and Executive Council for consideration. The programme will focus on integrating bio-physical with socio-economic science through alliances with stakeholders to build their capacities while ensuring that the outputs meet their needs and can be scaled-up for global impact.Source: ECA press release, 24 March 2008.  </p>

Cassava farmers should increase production and take advantage of rising demand for the crop, says senior agriculture officer, Uraia Waibuta. Mr Waibuta said cassava was in big demand in the local and overseas markets and Fiji had the high potential to meet the demand. ‘There are readily available markets for cassava for agro-processing, fresh exports and now the proposal for bio-fuel from cassava,’ he said. The Central Division has around 20,000 cassava farmers, who mostly produce for their own consumption while a few are involved in large scale farming for local markets and exports.Source: Fiji Times, 21 March 2008.  </p>
