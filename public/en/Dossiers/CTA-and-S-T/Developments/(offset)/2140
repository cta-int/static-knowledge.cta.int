						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p> The Tropical Legumes Project, launched in September, is a cross-continental research and development project that seeks to increase legume yields in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The project involves 14 African and Asian national agricultural research programmes, and is funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. ‘Legumes hold great promise for fighting hunger, increasing income and improving soil fertility,’ the statement said, adding however that legumes had not received the scientific or funding attention needed to increase crop yields of smallholder farmers' in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The first of the two-pronged approach focuses on sub-Saharan Africa and four legumes – beans, cowpeas, groundnut and chickpeas – and will be led by the CGIAR Generation Challenge Programme (GCP), in collaboration with partners from national research programmes, universities and CGIAR centres. The also focuses on large-scale breeding, seed multiplication and distribution, thus paving the way for the research results from the first approach to translate into breeding materials for the ultimate benefit of resource-poor farmers. These projects will partner with the Programme for African Seed Systems, a major initiative within the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, to ensure African farmers have access to seed of improved legume varieties.

					<p> Brazilian President Lula da Silva has urged African countries to take up the use of biofuels as a way of improving their economic independence. He is starting a four-nation tour of Africa, offering help from Brazil in developing biofuel technology. By moving away from fossil fuels African countries can help tackle climate change without sacrificing economic growth, President Lula said. The tour aims to widen the range of countries that produce biofuels. This is the latest stage in an intensive global effort by President Lula to promote the use of biofuels which have powered Brazilian vehicles for 30 years. Speaking in Burkina Faso, he said that a time when Africa was once again taking the path of economic growth ethanol and biodiesel could provide a way to guarantee the continent's energy autonomy and economic sovereignty. Earlier this year Brazil signed a partnership with the US to encourage ethanol production in central America and the Caribbean. The big Brazilian sugar cane growers are keen to see ethanol develop as a global commodity while President Lula sees it as a way of increasing Brazil's influence in the developing world. Some environmental groups in Brazil fear the rapid expansion of sugar cane plantations to grow ethanol could threaten sensitive ecosystems such as the Brazilian Savannah and indirectly the Amazon as cattle are displaced from other regions.

					<p> Unesco has approved a proposal to set up an African Science, Technology and Innovation Policy Initiative (Astipi) to help African countries draft national science, technology and innovation (STI) policies. The absence of a regulatory environment has been a constant cause for concern for scientists who believe the situation impacts negatively on the continent’ s ability to reduce poverty. Last month, the Economic Commission for Africa reported that 33 out of 53 countries in Africa are still without science ministries, which has weakened their ability to negotiate for favourable policies. Unesco hopes the Astipi will help countries create a legislative environment to reform their science systems. The Astipi, to be implemented with the help of Nepad, will kick off with a training program for 100 specialists in policy analysis. The two-year program will begin in 2008, and will include an Astipi postgraduate course, short-term executive workshops for senior government officials and an African e-library of science, technology and innovation policy. Unesco also approved two other projects to develop science in Africa. The science, technology and engineering education initiative will work towards revitalising higher education through the development of policies to retain qualified personnel. An African Virtual Campus, to be funded by the European Commission, is also underway. Source: Research Africa, 19 October 2007.</p>

					<p> South African sugar producers will be reluctant to invest in biofuels until the government finalises a long-delayed biofuel policy, the chairman of an industry body has said. Rodger Stewart, chairman of the South African Sugar Association (SASA), said until there was a definitive policy on biofuels the local industry would invest little in ethanol production. Officials have released draft biofuels policy documents with proposals on issues like ethanol and biodiesel blends, but an apparent wrangle over the more contentious matter of state subsidies has stalled a final policy. The Southern African Biofuels Association says it needs between 2 billion and 5 billion rand ($300 million and $740 million) a year from the government to get the capital intensive industry off the ground. ‘I think the problem is that we're in a policy vacuum at the moment. What we need first for ethanol (production) to work is a clear policy and at the moment the policy environment is not clear,’ Stewart said. South Africa is expected to unveil its own biofuels policy this year and officials hope it will open up new markets for producers in the struggling farming sector. The government wants biofuels to provide up to 75% of its renewable energy needs by 2013, joining the global push for cleaner energy alternatives to harmful fossil fuels.

					<p> Farm schools for vulnerable children affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic are playing an increasingly important role in sub-Saharan Africa, FAO said today. The schools are teaching orphans vital farming and life skills ensuring them sustainable livelihoods and long-term food security. A new manual on how to set up a junior farmer field and life school (JFFLS) has just been published by FAO and the World Food Programme (WFP). HIV and AIDS have a tremendous impact on rural communities in Africa, particularly on children. “Children and youth are charged with the heaviest burden of the AIDS crisis,” said Marcela Villarreal, Director of FAO’s Gender, Equity and Rural Employment Division. “Without their parents, they become more vulnerable to hunger and poverty, disease, conflict, sexual exploitation, forced migration and environmental degradation. The schools are an attempt to give orphans the means and the confidence to survive in an often very difficult environment,” she added. The number of orphans and other vulnerable children is growing in sub-Saharan Africa as a serious consequence of the AIDS epidemic, conflicts and displacement. To date, sub-Saharan Africa accounts for more than 40 million orphans, with an estimated 11.4 million children orphaned by AIDS. Source: FAO Newsroom, 28 November 2007.

					<p> The CDM in Africa should be African-led programme, focused on real projects in partnership with local institutions, said David Mwiraria, Kenya’s environment minister. Progress to kick-start the CDM in Africa has been slow.’ Work is still needed to ensure Africa plays a big role in the project tangible results are to be realized,’ he said. ‘Local institutions should play a big role in the projects.’ Mwiraria called on all parties to the climate change convention to recognize that the challenge of framing of future climate regime is extremely urgent. Out of more than 850 CDM projects now being implemented worldwide, only 23 (2.6%) are in Africa. UNDP, UNEP, the World Bank, African Development Bank and the UN Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) secretariat have joined forces to write a project proposal, and are now seeking donor support. The first outcome is a joint UNEP six-country CDM capacity development project managed by the UNDP in Addis Ababa, which covers Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia, and was launched in October. ‘In Africa, efforts to capture CDM benefits are accelerating, supported by a number of individual and joint UN efforts. Overcoming the complexity of the CDM and general investment barriers cannot be done overnight, but our sustained efforts are producing results,’ John Christensen, head of UNEP Risø Centre in Denmark.

					<p> Confronting the disparity between the role of African women in farming and their limited presence in the agricultural sciences, the CGIAR Gender &amp; Diversity Program will embark on an unprecedented US$13 million initiative to help advance the careers of at least 360 African women scientists. Funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the initiative will reach women in Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. CGIAR President Kathy Sierra announced the new effort during the opening ceremony of AGM07. ‘The CGIAR started the G&amp;D Program to heighten the role of women in international agricultural research and help them advance their careers as scientists. We also wanted to ensure that the results of our work are reaching African women,’ she said. ‘This new commitment will greatly further those goals.’ The African Women in Agricultural Research and Development (AWARD) Program is being funded with a 4-year grant. The grant represents the Gates Foundation’s belief in the importance of engaging women at every level in agricultural development. Today, women farmers produce 60–80% of Africa’s food supply, yet they comprise less than 20 percent of agricultural researchers. Source: CGIAR Press release, December 2007.</p>

					<p> The African Development Bank (AfDB) has approved a €10 million loan for a project in Gabon involving both replanting old and establishing new oil palm and rubber plantations with high-yielding trees. According to the AfDB, the project will have a strong social development impact and help increase the living standards of the rural population. The project will contribute to diversify Gabon’s economy, which is heavily dependent on crude oil, a sector controlled by a tiny elite. The country's petroleum resources are in decline and even though Gabon has a large agricultural potential, the sector has been underinvested because of the past oil boom. Palm oil and natural rubber now offer the most immediate strategy to make Gabon less dependent on oil revenues and to prepare it for the unavoidable post-oil era. Both commodities are experiencing record prices as a result of high petroleum prices (palm oil as a substitute for diesel, natural rubber which follows petroleum-derived synthetic rubber prices).</p>

If implemented, they will provide the information needed by African policymakers and investors to make informed decisions that will lead the region towards satisfying the growing energy demand and catalysing the rapid growth urgently needed in the development and growth of all economic and social sectors. ICSU ROA says it has drawn up a US$10 million budget for the project, to be carried out over five years, which would lead to the creation of a continental energy database. It would also increase human and institutional collaboration between modelling centres in the region. Funding for the projects is expected to come from various sources including the ICSU unions, the AU and regional economic blocks.</p>

					<p> Global animal food production is undergoing a major transformation that could lead to a higher risk of disease transmission from animals to humans, FAO has warned. ‘The risk of disease transmission from animals to humans will increase in the future due to human and livestock population growth, dynamic changes in livestock production, the emergence of worldwide agro-food networks and a significant increase in the mobility of people and goods,’ FAO said in a policy brief. ‘There is no doubt that the world has to depend upon some of the technologies of intensive animal food production systems,’ said FAO livestock policy expert Joachim Otte. ‘But excessive concentration of animals in large-scale industrial production units should be avoided and adequate investments should be made in heightened biosecurity and improved disease monitoring to safeguard public health,’ he added.

					<p> Africa appears to plunge from one corporate nightmare to another. Just as we begin to come to terms with the colonially-sponsored corporate conquest of our oil resources, along comes a new wave of ‘green’ companies turning fertile African lands to Northern ‘gold’. Senegalese president and agrofuel promoter Abdoulaye Wade has called this ‘a new revolution in Africa.’ Others have likened it to ‘the new scramble for Africa’. The first impression of the global agrofuel movement was that of a ‘win-win’ scenario. The rationale offered by the global North was the reasonable sounding desire to minimize dependence on traditional fuel sources such as oil and coal by investing in renewable energy source from plants. This, the argument continued, will ensure that carbon contained in fossil fuels remains safely stored in the earth, thereby reducing the impact to the earth’s climate. Furthermore, fuel crops grown are supposed to provide a ‘carbon sink’ by capturing and storing carbon dioxide and assisting with balancing concentrations of the gas in the atmosphere. The global South was promised that agrofuel would lead to climate-related benefits and an increase in revenue derived from selling the crops to growing green markets. New evidence has, however, challenged each of these presumptions. In the face of reckless new targets, large-scale land conversion for energy crops, increasing food prices and damning scientific reports, government’s actions are increasingly being labeled by environmentalists as fraudulent. Ultimately, the challenge for Africa will be to map its own path for sustainable development, and not to be swept away by the current wave of potentially ill-conceived ‘green’ schemes.</p>

					<p> Jatropha does not offer an easy answer to biofuels problems, as some countries hope, because it can be toxic and yields are unreliable, experts and industry officials have warned. The woody plant can grow on barren, marginal land, and so is increasingly popular in countries such as China that are keen to boost biofuels output but nervous about food security. But its nuts and leaves are toxic, requiring careful handling by farmers and at crushing plants, said experts at an oils and fats conference. In addition, it is labour-intensive, as each fruit ripens at a different time and needs to be harvested separately. Its productivity is also low and has yet to be stabilised. M.R. Chandran, adviser to the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, said it would take five years of intensive research before jatropha could achieve productivity that would make its cultivation economically viable. The oil yield of the plant, originating in Africa and still largely a wild species, is less than 2 tonnes per hectare with large swings from year to year. An engineer specialising in oil and fat processing plants, including for biodiesel production, said special facilities were needed for crushing jatropha nuts as they could produce a toxic vapour.</p>

					<p> A recent poll revealed that 50% of Kenyan men would prefer women who earn less than them, and only 35% of the men would prefer women who earn the same as them. Furthermore, 45% of the men would prefer women with the same education; 20% would be happy with less educated women; and 50% would prefer women who worked part time, while only 39% would prefer women who worked full time. These women, who ought to earn less, learn less and work on part time basis are responsible for half of the world’s food production and produce between 60 and 80% of the food in most developing countries (FAO). In spite of their massive contribution to food security in sub-Saharan Africa, women are continually overlooked in agricultural development. Women’s engagement in agricultural science, technology and innovation systems (only 18% of researchers are women) is low. Increasing their engagement, quantitatively and qualitatively, will contribute to achieving the desired transformation in the agricultural sector. Their contribution will be much greater if they have equal access to essential resources and services. In many societies, tradition and laws bar women from owning land. Without land to serve as collateral, women are cut off from access to credit. And without credit, they often cannot buy essential inputs – such as seeds, tools and fertilizer – or invest in irrigation and land improvements. A marketplace that is free will give women more choices and remove the obstacles they face. This will yield a triple harvest – improving their lives; allowing them to put their labour, knowledge and creativity to work more productively and feeding Africa. It is not a matter of who is better – but of making a combined effort to keep the agricultural engine running!</p>

					<p> The World Bank has approved a US$3.2 million grant to strengthen the rural economy of the Solomon Islands by increasing access to infrastructure and services for rural communities. The Rural Development Project (RDP) is the first phase of the implementation of the Solomon Islands Agricultural and Rural Development Strategy, which aims to promote growth, create jobs and to increase incomes in rural communities using a community-driven approach. The RDP will support the Solomon Islands Government’s national rural development goals and will focus both on institution building and stimulating rural growth, including local infrastructure and service delivery; improved agricultural services; rural business development and program management.</p>

					<p> Africa’s drive to boost food security and to fight off locust swarms and crop diseases has led to an unintended consequence: the build-up of obsolete but toxic pesticides and chemicals. Across Africa, an estimated 50,000 tonnes of pesticides and other heavily contaminated materials have accumulated. Inadequate legislation and lax regulations have exacerbated the problem. The Africa Stockpiles Programme (ASP), a partnership between the World Bank, private sector and civil society, has launched a continent-wide effort to clean up these harmful chemicals, prevent future accumulations, promote safe-handling techniques by working directly with farmers, and strengthen African institutional capacities to tackle the issue. ‘The challenge is a long-term one: to help farmers properly control pests so that they not only minimize immediate risks from dangerous pesticides but also reduce the possibility of accumulating future stocks,’ said Monique Barbut of the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The ASP emphasizes prevention measures and education of farmers, households and communities as key components of its projects. In the first phase, clean-up and prevention activities have started in six countries – Mali, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania and Tunisia – and more will be launched in Ethiopia, Eritrea and Mozambique. ASP partners have begun using radio programs, local theater and mobile cinemas to bring their messages to farmers and communities in remote rural areas. The results and evaluation of these activities will be used to guide the launch of a second phase in 10–15 additional African countries.</p>

<h2><a class="listing" style="link" href="/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Developments/OECD-warns-against-biofuels-subsidies" title="OECD warns against biofuels subsidies" alt="link">OECD warns against biofuels subsidies</a></h2>

	
					<p> A new report from the OECD urges governments to phase-out biofuel subsidies, on the grounds that they are pushing up global food prices and threatening natural habitats. The report says biofuel subsidies will create ‘powerful incentives to replace natural eco-systems such as forests, wetlands and pasture with dedicated bio-energy crops.’ It also indicates that biofuels are not the most efficient way to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Biofuels could be used to reduce energy-related emissions by at most 3%, the report says, but this benefit would come at a huge financial cost. The report recommends instead that governments employ ‘technology-neutral’ carbon taxes to allow the market to find the most efficient ways of reducing greenhouse gases.</p>
