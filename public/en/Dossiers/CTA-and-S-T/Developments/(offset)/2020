						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

A project focusing on the coproduction of food and biofuels will yield an estimated 10,000 formal jobs. The initiative is one in a series of recent bilateral and private investments in Central Africa's very large bioenergy potential. The Eni model combines the traditional activities of hydrocarbon exploration and production with sustainability and important initiatives with unconventional and renewable sources. Throughout the shared program with Eni, the Republic of Congo will maximise its own potential as a major energy producing country and become a benchmark in Africa in the tar sands and biofuels field, as a further benefit of food farming development.

					<p> Japan, New Partnership for African Development, NEPAD and Alliance for Green Revolution in Africa have today launched a project to double Africa’s rice production in the next decade. Launched on Friday, the project aims to provide a variety of measures to increase rice production in the continent and will focus its efforts on getting high-yielding varieties of rice to smallholder farmers, improving soils, and supporting new agricultural research.Called the Coalition for African Rice Development (CARD), the project aims to drastically reduce Africa’s reliance on expensive rice imports through the development and distribution of the new resilient rice varieties for the continent’s smallholder farmers. According to the Africa Rice Center, the sufficiency ratio declined steadily over a 45-year period from 112% in 1961 to 61% in 2006, when the continent relied on the international rice market to satisfy about 39% of its rice consumption needs. The new initiative hopes to build on successful programs in countries like Uganda and Nigeria, where governments have cut rice imports in half over a few short years through investments in high yielding NERICA rice varieties that require little or no irrigation and are capable of growing in upland and lowland environments.

					<p> An Agricultural Officer in Botswana has called for the upgrading of Agricultural Research Stations into institutions that would lead in recommending appropriate technologies for farming. Only about 0.7% of total Botswana land area is arable. Crop production is hampered by traditional farming methods, recurrent drought, erosion, and disease. Most of the land under cultivation is in the eastern region and the principal crops for domestic use are sorghum, maize, and millet. Agricultural research has been devoted to soil conservation, grazing experiments, and developing and distributing improved strains of grain. The construction of dams and the drilling of boreholes to tap underground water are continuing government programs. In early 1990, the government changed its official agricultural policy to emphasize the production only of those foodstuffs which can be raised economically.

					<p> With the global trade in carbon credits soon expected to top $100 billion annually, there is wide recognition that ways must to found to bring Africa, the least developed of the world’s continents, more fully into the market---and Africans are eager for this. Amid signs that global warming is damaging earth’s climate faster than expected, the UN is working with African governments and businesses to attract billions of dollars to the continent in “green” investments in cleaner energy and transport systems through a new financing body known as the Clean Development Mechanism. The opportunities are as great as the obstacles. Speaking on behalf of the African group of nations at Bali, the Nigeria government noted that adequate funding for climate change adaptation in Africa “remains inaccessible due to conditionality of co-financing… There is too much emphasis on seminars, workshops and needs assessment. For how long will our needs continue to be assessed?” In the meantime, the government said, “the suffering of our people continues.” Source: Michael Fleshman, African Science News Service, 6 June, 2008. </p>

Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) today called for renewed commitment to a revolution in sustainable agriculture, which was set for success in the 1990s but then stalled as a result of waning financial support.

Success will require a substantial increase in funding and collective action among all key actors and players,” Frison stressed.

					<p> The quality of statistical information from 17 countries in sub-Saharan Africa will be dramatically increased with grant funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, reported FAO today. The US$ 5.6 million grant over two years will allow the 17 countries identified, through the FAO country statistics information system (CountrySTAT), to substantially improve the quality, accessibility, relevance and reliability of their national statistics on food and agriculture. In so doing, it will facilitate planning and decision-making by policy makers and analysts, particularly in the push to reduce hunger and poverty. “Ensuring reliability of country data is crucial both to governments and to those working with countries to reduce undernourishment and strengthen agricultural and rural development. With good and reliable data it is much easier to pinpoint where assistance is working, where it may be weak and understanding possible future needs”, says Hafez Ghanem, FAO Assistant Director-General for the Economic and Social Development. The countries involved in the two-year project are: Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.

The World Bank competition sought innovative lighting technologies to address this burgeoning need. Unlike solar, wind or hydropower, bio-fuel cells generate electricity instanly, anywhere, any day, regardless of whether the sun shines, the wind blows or the water flows. They do not need batteries to store energy for later use. Moreover, Lebônê's electricity is both very reliable and 'dirt cheap' - a basic requirement for its application in poor rural, off-grid environments.

					<p> The environmental and social costs of producing biofuels on land can be avoided by farming seaweed, says Ricardo Radulovich. The dream of tackling climate change with biofuels has been tarnished by the rush to produce them on land. Not only are there serious environmental costs, including deforestation, water use, production of greenhouse gases, and energy-efficiency limitations, but there are rising concerns about the effects on the world's poor. The oceans are the largest active carbon sink on the planet, covering more than 70 per cent of its surface area, and are predicted to grow as sea levels rise. Our seas also receive a larger proportion of the world's sunshine than land does, particularly in the tropical and subtropical belt where land is more scarce. To agriculturalists, the oceans are vast and grossly underused fields well-provided with sunlight and water. The full potential for sea cultivation (mariculture) has only recently been recognised. The 'blue revolution' of freshwater aquaculture and mariculture is growing exponentially. The greatest spin-off from switching biofuels production to the oceans would be the return of land to food production, making food and nutrition more easily available to the world's poor.

					<p> The Democratic Republic of Congo is debating the pros and cons of its enormous untapped agricultural potential, in particular for the production of biofuels, while in Rome the international community is discussing the food crisis. Surprisingly, the country's stakeholders are rather optimistic about what biofuels can do for Congo's development. According to agricultural experts, the DRC alone has the agro-ecological capacity to grow food for 2 to 3 billion people. It currently uses less than 5 per cent of its potential arable land. With investments in modern agriculture, the country could thus feed all the new people that will be born between today and 2050 (when the planet will have a population of around 9 billion). The FAO says a very large portion of this potential is highly suitable for the production of sustainable energy crops. Biofuels and bioenergy produced in the country would be low cost and highly competitive with current oil and electricity prices, and thus benefit the nation's economic development. What is more, biofuels could actually improve the life of farmers and make them more resilient, as well as making food less costly for the urban populations. Source: Biopact, 5 June 2008.</p>

					<p> Ethiopia said on Monday it planned to produce biofuels to cut high oil import bills, but dismissed fears the strategy could hit food production in a country suffering a severe drought. Some 4.5 million Ethiopians need emergency food aid due to failed rains and high food prices, reviving grim memories of the country's 1984-1985 famine, which killed more than 1 million. &quot;There is no shortage of agriculture land in Ethiopia for food production,&quot; Melis Teka, coordinator of biofuel development in the Ministry of Mines and Energy, told Reuters. &quot;We have up to 23 million hectares which could be developed both for crops and biofuel. Biofuel plants are being developed on arid and barren land not suitable for food production.&quot; The government says it could make one billion litres of ethanol a year from four state-run sugar estates, and has also issued 37 licences to private investors to set up biofuel plants. The country also plans to produce biofuel from jatropha, castor beans and oil palm plantations. &quot;As the country accelerates its economic development, the demand for petroleum is anticipated to increase,&quot; Melis said. &quot;The development of biofuel is expected to be an alternative source of energy to meet the anticipated demand.&quot; Source: Reuters, Addis Ababa, 9 June 2008. </p>

					<p> Thirty years after the first “green revolution” transformed agriculture in Asia and Latin America, as new seed varieties and copious fertiliser enabled farmers to break out of the subsistence trap, Africa is trying to follow suit. Farmers, agronomists and development experts say that new technology alone, particularly in the short term, will bring no radical transformation. Quicker gains can be made improving markets and transport, which will help expand existing, under-used technologies. But there is disagreement over whether Africa should seek an agribusiness model based on big commercial farms or concentrate on improving the lot of its millions of smallholders. Moreover, the difficulties in transforming African agriculture are manifold. Africa’s agricultural research capability has received almost as little attention as its soils in recent decades, its cash-strapped governments having cut back heavily on basic science. The green revolution will have to confront one of the most controversial issues in world farming: genetically modified crops. African countries have been slow to adopt GM. Indeed, the way in which new and existing technologies interact with the economies and societies of Africa is critical, not just to whether the green revolution will work technically but also whether it will bring widespread benefits to Africa’s poor.

					<p> ROME — Is there a food crisis? In the strictest definition, no. There is hunger, but no starvation. There are sporadic food riots in the poorest countries, but no widespread, out-of-control urban panic. Viewed in a different way, the crisis is genuine and potentially horrific. The brutal truth is that the world has consumed more food than it has produced for the past eight years. Global stocks for rice and soya, the staple foods for billions of people, have fallen to 10 to 15 per cent of annual consumption from about 20 per cent (the stock-to-use ratio). In other words, the world is no more than two months - a month short of the next harvest - from running out of food. Medium- and long-term solutions are where the challenges lie. Where should the money and energy go? In spite of food's near vertical price curve since 2006, prices, adjusted for inflation, are still well below their mid-1970s level. The food &quot;crisis&quot; may just be getting started. Source: Eric Reguly, Globe and Mail, June 2, 2008. </p>

					<p> The effects of the food crisis can be seen plastered across the front pages of newspapers: food riots, ration cards, export bans, a US farm bill which included an unprecedented outlay for food stamps. But these short-term responses represent mere acts of desperation intended to temporarily alleviate some of the food shortages, and only hint at some of the medium-term and long-term implications, which are outlined below. In virtually every major country and region, inflation is approaching dangerous levels. The world’s poor have clearly born the brunt of the food crisis, but surely some people are benefiting, right? Look no further then agribusiness, the loose collection of interests that vastly influence the production and distribution of agricultural products in the US. Naturally, the agribusinesses have pledged to use a portion of their profits to help poor countries with their food problems. Source: CurrencyTrading.net, June 4, 2008. </p>

					<p> Key institutions involved in agricultural research and funding have signed a Memorandum of Understanding aimed at significantly increasing food production in Africa’s “breadbasket regions,” link local food production to food needs, and work across Africa’s major agricultural growing areas—or agro-ecological zones—to create opportunities for smallholder farmers. The MOU was signed by the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and the World Food Programme (WFP) at the FAO High-Level Conference on World Food Security. The agreement marks a significant transformation in the way major global agencies work with smallholder farmers to assist them in solving Africa’s chronic hunger and food problems. The new partnership will help to advance the goal of the Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP) of the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD) towards achieving at least 6 percent annual growth rate in agricultural production by 2015.

					<p> The Africa Progress Panel's report, &quot;Africa's Development: Promises and Prospects,&quot; being launched today by Kofi Annan, Michel Camdessus and Tidjane Thiam in London, states that the world food crisis &quot;threatens to destroy years, if not decades, of economic progress&quot; as &quot;100 million people are being pushed back into absolute poverty.&quot; &quot;Unless some way can be found to halt and reverse the current trend in food prices there will be a significant increase in hunger, malnutrition, and in infant and child mortality.&quot; The Africa Progress Panel's report also warns that, despite progress on debt relief and significant increases in assistance by individual countries, &quot;the G8's commitment to double assistance to Africa by 2010 is not likely to be fulfilled.&quot; The report identifies a shortfall of 0 billion in aid that needs to be filled if the G8 is to meet the targets set at Gleneagles.

					<p> Concrete action plans developed to urgently stimulate rice production in 11 African countries as an immediate follow-up to the Rome World Food Summit In response to the current soaring rice prices, an Emergency Rice Initiative for Africa has just been launched to provide urgent assistance to rice-growing countries in the continent in four major areas: seed; fertilizer; best-bet technologies; and post-harvest and marketing. Launched jointly by the Africa Rice Center (WARDA), Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), IFDC, Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the Emergency Rice Initiative will operate under the framework of the FAO Soaring Food Prices Initiative. “Our primary aim is to enhance the capacity of our member countries to significantly increase their rice production as of 2008 and 2009,” said Dr Papa Abdoulaye Seck, Director General of the Africa Rice Center, an association of African member countries and one of the 15 centers supported by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).

					<p> According to a new study by experts from the world's leading agronomic and agricultural economics research institution - the Wageningen University &amp; Research Centre - neither speculation nor biofuels are to blame for the current high food prices. Instead, and despite some people's attempts to focus excessively on these factors, a complex set of many other forces is at play. Wageningen UR also projects world food prices to decline again, continuing the historic long term trend towards ever lower prices for food. What is more, compared with all other commodities, food prices have increased far less dramatically. Wageningen UR asked a number of its experts to contribute to the national and international discussion by offering analysis from different perspectives. It seems that the current wave of price surges is such a peak. The current peaks in the prices are lower than the peak in the food prices in the 1970s, which was the result of the oil crisis. Of course, the trend can change, but the expectation is that the response to the current, high prices - increased, large investments in agriculture - will again cause a decline.
