They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

																									<p class="intro">Introduction:</p>
							 <p>This document describes the methodology for a case study to be implemented by the partner ACP institution.  The relevant term of reference is:</p> <p>' <i>Develop a methodology for the conduct of a case study by an ACP institution in each of the two target countries for developing and implementing demand-led research programmes for one selected sub-sector and bringing relevant issues to the attention of policy makers within a minimum of 6 months following the training intervention.  This activity will serve to evaluate the success of the training intervention in three critical areas; research priority setting, involvement of other actors in the decision making processes, and influencing policy makers.</i>'</p> <p>The key elements required of the case study are therefore:</p> 
<ul>
 
<li> Developing and implementing demand-led research programmes;  </li>
 
<li> Bringing relevant issues to the attention of policy makers;  </li>
 
<li> Research priority setting; and  </li>
 
<li> Involving other actors in the decision making process. </li>
 
</ul>
 <p>The case study is to be completed in six to ten months after the training course, so the methodology is designed with that timescale in mind.  Significant policy changes and realignment of research priority setting procedures in national agricultural research systems are processes which can take years to achieve, so the case study methodology is also designed with the aim of initiating changes that should develop and mature long after the case study is complete.  The methodology is therefore designed not only to provide an achievement within the life of the case study, but to set the scene for longer term individual, organizational and institutional changes that will enhance the collaboration between actors in the ASTI system.</p>

 <p><b>Overview of methodology</b> </p> <p>The case study is to be conducted in the context of the following previous activities:</p> 
<ul>
 
<li> A training workshop on analysis of ASTI systems in ACP countries;  </li>
 
<li> National studies to analyze the ASTI systems in selected sub-sectors;.  </li>
 
<li> National training workshops which 
<ul>
 
<li> Introduced the elements of demand led research; and  </li>
 
<li> Undertook a preliminary research prioritization exercise for the selected sub-sector. </li>
 
</ul>
  </li>
 
</ul>
 <p>The case study will consist of a series of stakeholder consultations in different parts of the country followed by a national meeting involving policy makers.  The results of the study will be:</p> 
<ul>
 
<li> Ownership of a research agenda by a wide range of actors;  </li>
 
<li> A preliminary research agenda based on demand from different stakeholders; and  </li>
 
<li> Awareness and involvement by policy makers of the approach and outcomes. </li>
 
</ul>
 <p> For each stage in the methodology the following information is given.</p> <p><b> <i>Background</i>.</b> An overview of the stage and its objectives.</p> <p><b> <i>Who is involved?</i> </b> The person or organization responsible for the stage, and other participants and their roles.</p> <p><b> <i>How is it done?</i> </b> The methods to be used and activities to be undertaken in the stage.</p> <p><b> <i>What is achieved?</i> </b> The results or outputs of the stage.</p> <p><b> <i>When is it done?</i> </b> The suggested timing of the different stages.  A workplan indicating all the stages is given in Appendix A, but this is for guidance only and can be adjusted as necessary.</p> <p> </p> <p> <b>Stage 1. Form task force</b>  </p> <p><i> <b>Background</b> </i> </p> <p>The ACP organization will have overall responsibility for conducting the case study, and this should be managed by a small task force.  The task force will be involved in the preparations, implementation and synthesis of the case study, and its formation ensures the necessary expertise is available.</p> <p><b> <i>Who</i> </b> </p> <p>An officer of the ACP organization will be the task force leader.  Two or three other members are required, and should be drawn from amongst the training course participants. The taskforce members should represent the different stakeholder or actor categories as defined in the ASTI study.</p> <p><b> <i>What</i> </b> </p> <p>The formation of the task force will facilitate the necessary collaborative arrangements between actor groups and allocation of responsibility for the case study activities.</p> <p><b> <i>When</i> </b> </p> <p>The task force should be formed as soon as possible.</p> <p> </p> <p>
 <b>Stage 2. Plan stakeholder consultations</b> <br /> <b> <i></i> </b>  </p> <p><b> <i>Background</i> </b> </p> <p>The stakeholder consultations must promote active involvement and participation, using the principles covered in the training course.</p> <p><b> <i>Who</i> </b> </p> <p>The task force will design the stakeholder consultation.</p> <p><b> <i>How</i> </b> </p> <p>A draft programme and methodology for the stakeholder consultations is given under stage 3. The task force should meet to fill in details and make any modifications that they feel appropriate.  The host organizations for the consultations, who will be responsible for organizing each consultation, and where they will be held must be clearly defined.  The task force leader is responsible for organizing the meetings in collaboration with a contact person in each of the hosting institutions.</p> <p>Consultations should be planned to take into account the major production areas of the country, as well as provide an opportunity for involvement of different stakeholder groups. At least 4 consultations should be held.</p> <p><b> <i>What</i> </b> </p> <p>The outcome of the planning will be a schedule for hosting the stakeholder consultations, a finalized programme and an agreed methodology for each consultation.</p> <p><b> <i>When</i> </b> </p> <p>The planning for stakeholder consultations should take place in month 1.</p> <p> </p> <p> <b>Stage 3. Stakeholder consultations</b>  </p> <p><b> <i>Background</i> </b> </p> <p>The stakeholder consultations aim to collect views and information from a wide variety of actors, particularly those that are ‘users of innovations’ rather than the researchers. The emphasis is thus on enabling demand to be expressed.  The consultations will build on the preliminary exercise undertaken during the training workshop, to widen the inputs to the process and promote linkages among stakeholders.</p> <p><b> <i>Who</i> </b> </p> <p>The consultations will be organized and led by the task team.  At each consultation there should be about 10 - 15 participants (maximum 20).  The exact balance of participants from the targetted stakeholder groups will depend on the location of the different meetings, but it is recommended that research scientists should constitute no more than a quarter of the number.  Three quarters of the participants should come from other groups such as:</p> 
<ul>
 
<li> Producers, grower organizations;  </li>
 
<li> Processors, transporters;  </li>
 
<li> Service and support organizations working with growers (such as NGOs, extension services, unions);  </li>
 
<li> Input suppliers;  </li>
 
<li> Credit, finance, marketing boards, investment promotion agencies; and  </li>
 
<li> Regulatory boards and agencies. </li>
 
</ul>
 <p><b> <i>How</i> </b> </p> <p>The box shows a suggested programme for the consultation which can be completed in less than one day.  The programme should draw on the methodology and content of the training course to ensure that the consultation promotes participation.  If time allows practical exercise could be conducted to promote interaction.</p> <p>The task force leader or other team member should provide an introduction to the objectives of the meeting which are:</p> 
<ul>
 
<li> To introduce participants to demand led research;  </li>
 
<li> To promote linkages and interaction between different stakeholders; and  </li>
 
<li> To gather views from the users of research on the problems they face and what research areas they would want pursued. </li>
 
</ul>
 <p>The task force leader or one of the team members should also provide a short presentation on demand-led research.  This can be based on presentations made during the training course, emphasizing those parts most relevant to the particular group.</p> <p>A plenary brainstorm should then be held, also following the approach used in the training course.  Participants should be requested to think about the problems and constraints that they face or know about in the selected sub-sector.  A facilitator should lead the session, with participants given the chance to speak briefly about the constraint (s) they perceive.  Each constraint should be written on a card (one per card) and the cards stuck on the wall for everyone to see.  The facilitator should emphasize that the problems can be wide ranging, and not confined to production issues.  When all participants have had a chance to speak, the facilitator should lead a discussion to group the constraints and problems into clusters.  This process should not be laboured over as the clustering is not critical to the success of the exercise.</p> <p> </p>

</div> <p> </p> <p>After the plenary sessions the participants should be divided into three groups, each of which will need flip charts and marker pens.  The groups should be provided clear verbal instructions, based on a handout to be provided (see box).  Each of the groups should then present their results, allowing opportunity for discussion and comment.  The clusters of problem and constraints should be divided between the three groups to give roughly equal workloads.  The division of participants into groups should be done in a way that ensures different categories of actors are represented in all the working groups.  It is suggested that a member of the task force is assigned to each group to act as a facilitator, and to make sure discussions stay on track.</p> <p> </p>

     <p><b>Box: Draft handout for group work</b> </p> <p>
 <b> <i>Research topics</i> </b> <br />In your group, review all the problems and constraints that have been allocated.  For each problem or constraint, consider what Research could be undertaken to help reduce the problem.  Note that research is not the same as solving a problem.  For example, a problem might be that roads used for sending produce to market are bad.  The solution would be to build or maintain the roads, but that is not research.  However, research could be undertaken to help policy makers decide on whether to allocate more funds to road maintenance.  So a suitable research topic to help solve the problem of poor roads could be an economic evaluation of the costs and benefits of maintaining roads in relation to the selected sub-sector.  Look at each problem or constraint and identify any relevant research topics.  Some problems may have no obvious researchable issue, while others might have more than one.  Some research topics may address several problems. </p> <p>
 <b> <i>Ranking</i> </b> <br />After listing all the research topics, give an estimate of the priority of each, as low, medium or high.  During the presentation of the group work, be ready to explain why you ranked the research topics as you did. </p> 
    </td>
</tr>
</table>
</div> <p> </p> <p>The groups should then present their findings, and any similarities and differences noted.  Where there is a large difference in ranking for similar research topics, discussion should seek to obtain a consensus from the participants.</p> <p>A final plenary session should present the key results of the training workshop at which a preliminary identification of research topics was made.  Again any differences or similarities between the topics identified in the consultation and those previously identified should be discussed.  The process of using identified criteria to rank research topics can be introduced, but details should not be given.  The aim of this session should be to stimulate feedback from the participants.  It is important that good notes are taken of the plenary sessions so that the results can be written up.</p> <p><b> <i>What</i> </b> </p> <p>The outcomes of the consultations will be:</p> 
<ul>
 
<li> Involvement of a wide range of people in the process, so broad ownership;  </li>
 
<li> A list of problems and constraints in the sub-sector;   </li>
 
<li> A list of possible research topics with a qualitative assessment of priority; and   </li>
 
<li> Feedback on the research priorities identified at the training workshop. </li>
 
</ul>
 <p><b> <i>When</i> </b> </p> <p>The consultations should take place in months 3-4.</p> <p> </p> <p><b>Stage 4. Synthesis of constraints and research topics</b> </p> <p><b> <i>Background</i> </b> </p> <p>The results of the consultations need to be compiled and synthesized to give a consolidated output.</p> <p><b> <i>Who</i> </b> </p> <p>The synthesis will be undertaken by the task force leader.</p> <p><b> <i>How</i> </b> </p> <p>The constraints and problems from the training workshop and those from the stakeholder consultations need to be merged to provide a single consolidated list.  Where there are obvious duplications they should be eliminated.  If there is any doubt or ambiguity, it is better to retain rather than discard views.</p> <p>The final list should then be clustered for ease of presentation in the report. The groupings used in the training workshop can be retained or new categories created if the task team prefers.</p> <p>Research topics also need to be clustered under the same headings, and presented together with their qualitative priority.  The origin of the topic (which meeting) should also be indicated, again promoting ownership of the output.</p> <p><b> <i>What</i> </b> </p> <p>The output of the synthesis will be consolidated findings of the consultations, comprising problems and constraints, possible research topics to address the constraints, and an initial assessment of their priority.</p> <p><b> <i>When</i> </b> </p> <p>The synthesis should be completed in month 5.</p> <p> </p> <p><b>Stage 5. Scan of existing research</b> </p> <p><b> <i>Background</i> </b> </p> <p>Prioritizing research must take account of existing research to avoid duplication, and use and build on results already available.  This step will not involve a full review but simply identify areas where research is ongoing.</p> <p><b> <i>Who</i> </b> </p> <p>This step is undertaken by the task force with additional technical expertise co-opted as needed.  Other task force members and stakeholders should be encouraged to provide information.</p> <p><b> <i>How</i> </b> </p> <p>For each of the identified potential research topics in the consolidated list prepared under stage 4, a note should be made of any ongoing national research, and whether it is adequately addressing the specific topic.  If little or no research on the topic is in progress, or if research is planned, this should also be stated.</p> <p>The information can be presented in a table as follows.</p> <p><b> <i>Research Topic</i> </b>: The topics identified by the training workshop and stakeholder consultations</p> <p><b> <i>Status</i> </b>: Status of any research on the topic in the country: None, planned, ongoing, or completed</p> <p><b> <i>Organizations</i> </b>: The organizations involved in any identified research</p> <p><b> <i>Brief description</i> </b>: A sentence describing the purpose of any identified research.</p> <p>If there is more than one existing research effort related to a topic, there may be more than one line in the table for the topic. International research projects that members are aware of that have relevance should be mentioned.</p> <p><b> <i>What</i> </b> </p> <p>The output will be a table listing the potential research topics identified by the training workshop and stakeholder consultations, together with a brief indication of any existing relevant research.</p> <p><b> <i>When</i> </b> </p> <p>The scan should be completed in month 5.</p> <p> </p> <p> <b>Stage 6. National seminar</b>  </p> <p><b> <i>Background</i> </b> </p> <p>An important part of demand-led research is engaging policy makers, and raising their awareness of the issues and options.  The national seminar will do this through presenting the findings of the case study and promoting dialogue among stakeholders at a senior level.</p> <p><b> <i>Who</i> </b> </p> <p>The task force will organize and lead the seminar.</p> <p><b> <i>How</i> </b> </p> <p>The seminar should be short (half day maximum) so that policy makers are able to attend.  Participants should be senior representatives of the different stakeholder groups, including small-scale farmers.  Policy makers and government representatives should be invited not only from the ministries relating to science, research, agriculture, education, but also trade, industry and commerce and any others that are relevant to specific research topics.  For example, if transportation of produce due to poor roads is a problem, and a research topic has been identified as an economic analysis of the cost to the sub-sector of poor roads, then representatives from the ministries responsible for roads and/or transport should be invited.  Thus the participants should be a group of people who perhaps do not usually meet to discuss such issues.  A meeting which is largely composed of researchers and scientists should be avoided.</p> <p>With senior government representation it should be possible to ensure good media coverage of the event.  A press briefing should be prepared to hand out at the seminar, together with the policy brief.</p> <p>A draft programme is shown in the box.</p> <p>A keynote address on the sub-sector should be presented by a policy maker, preferably from the economic or trade perspective rather than the agricultural perspective.</p> <p>The presentation on demand-led research can be based on the one used in the stakeholder consultations, and should aim to make the policy makers aware of the changes that are required, particularly at organizational and institutional level.</p> <p>A presentation on the research prioritization exercise should be made covering the outcome of the training workshop and the stakeholder consultations, highlighting any issues of particular importance to policy makers.</p> <p>A final plenary discussion can cover any points arising from the presentations, but possible questions for discussion include:</p> 
<ul>
 
<li> How can research in the sub-sector become more demand-led?  </li>
 
<li> What institutional and organizational changes need to be made to support demand-led research;  </li>
 
<li>  What formal structures (such as cross-sectoral committees, public-private sector fora etc) can be used or created to enhance communication and linkages in the ASTI system.  </li>
