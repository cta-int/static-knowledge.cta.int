They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="../../../../S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems.html">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	When Odaly Aroche set out from the mountains of Topes de Collantes in central Cuba to see what other women farmers were doing in San Andrés, 380 km west of her home, her neighbours told her she was crazy. But that didn’t stop her. More than a year after her first trip, Aroche has become a leader in her community, where she has won admiration for her innovative ideas that have helped improve economic and environmental conditions in this rural area, which has thrown itself open to new farming techniques.

					<p>The July-issue of I4d is completely devoted to the role of women in the ICT4D domain. Gender has not been on the conscious agenda of the ICT4D domain area. It is not therefore unusual for development programmes to be conceptualised without taking into consideration the key or special needs of women. Even when development programmes have addressed access issues, like the telecentres, infrastructure development, etc they have been put in place with a concern for reaching the unreached, but not necessarily developed with gender sensitive designs, or bearing in mind the language and social needs of women. With the advent of new technologies for communications, be it the telephones or mobiles, or computers, there has been a slow but steady uptake of the technologies by women. Wherever women’s organisations have consciously designed programmes to suit the specific needs of women, they have created new opportunities for empowerment, improvement in livelihoods, and overall well being of the families that women nurture.</p>

					<p>Lack of access to water and sanitation is already exposing rural women in conflict areas to more dangers like battering, rape, and poverty. But with the looming impacts expected due to climate change, these dangers are feared that they will double. Due to social gender roles, women are made responsible to meet water and sanitation needs of the family. In North Eastern Uganda, like Karamoja and Teso, a woman walks an average of ten kilometers in the dry season for water, spending 15-17 hours a week looking for water. Girls too are being affected with the lack of water and sanitation---affecting their schooling the most and have to share toilet facilities with boys. Many of them have ended up dropping out of school. Discrimination against women due to gender violates women’s rights, undermines their health and well-being and cripples development of individual women’s status (Source: Pius Sawa, Africa Science News, 5 August 2008). </p>

					<p>According to the Ministry of agriculture in Zimbabwe 80% of communal farmers in Zimbabwe are women and 10% of the extension staff are women. On a global scale, women constitute the majority and are most engaged in agriculture. If interventions in agriculture are to engineer a green revolution in Africa and turn Africa from its hunger, disease and malnutrition brand, it is urgent that the continent revisits gender issues in the agricultural development. An X-ray view of gender issues in agriculture will reveal constraints ranging from-lack of relevant client based and customized agricultural extension aimed at serving the needs of women in agriculture, a skewed resource ownership tilted against women, patriarchal views discouraging women from leadership roles in society, limited land rights to women in Africa and lack of technical know-how (Source: by Hillary Kundishora, The African Executive, 18-25 June 2008).</p>

The Final Declaration of the FAO High Level Conference on World Food Security and Climate Change – Rome - 5 June / FAO Summit ignores women farmers as solution to agricultural renaissance, says ActionAid. Women farmers have the potential to be a rural engine for growth but the crisis food summit this week has failed to seize on women as part of the solution, said ActionAid today (Friday 5 June).“Women produce up to 80% of the food in some developing countries on a day to day basis but they own 2% of the land and receive only 1% of the resources allocated to agricultural enterprise and will struggle to grow more food unless rich countries massively increase their support,” said Magdalena Kropiwnicka, ActionAid’s Food Policy Analyst. “A sustainable response can only take place if women are put at the centre of strategies to solve the food crisis. Without women, failure is inevitable,” she added. Source: African Press Organization (APO), Rome, June 6, 2008. </p>

Women entrepreneurs can face the same problem worldwide: the difficulty of starting and expanding a business in a male-dominated business environment that often is not receptive to their efforts. One woman who has flourished despite such challenges is South African Cheyyann Bodington, who started TESA Palisade Fencing and Security Systems. Bodington recently was honored in New York, along with 11 other international women entrepreneurs, as a winner of the second annual International Women's Entrepreneurial Challenge (IWEC). Two other African women were honored along with Bodington: Ibukun Awosika, of The Chair Centre Group of Lagos, Nigeria, and Winifred Mwendia (Winnie Gitau), founder andpresident of Pure Health Products of Kenya. The IWEC awards are a joint project by the Chamber of Commerce of Barcelona in association with the Indian Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Manhattan Chamber of Commerce of New York. The project hopes to promote a global dialogue on women's entrepreneurship so that women entrepreneurs can exchange experiences, forge partnerships among enterprises and potential customers worldwide, and build personal contacts and networks among women's usiness associations and individual entrepreneurs.
