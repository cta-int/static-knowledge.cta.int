						<dt><a href="../../../S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation.html">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Women play a critical and potentially transformative role in agricultural growth in developing countries, but they face persistent obstacles and economic constraints limiting further inclusion in agriculture. The Index is a significant innovation in its field and aims to increase understanding of the connections between women’s empowerment, food security, and agricultural growth. It measures the roles and extent of women’s engagement in the agriculture sector in five domains: (i) Decisions about agricultural production; (ii) Access to and decision making power over productive resources; (iii) Control over use of income; (iv) Leadership in the community; and (v) Time use. It also measures women’s empowerment relative to men within their households. It allows us to identify women who are disempowered and understand how to increase autonomy and decision making in key domains.</p>

She writes:&quot;As we mark the 100th anniversary of International Women’s Day, a global day celebrating the economic, political and social achievements of women past, present and future, it is unfortunate that it is only those women who enjoy a space and platform in academics, science, economics and politics who are celebrated and yet in Africa there is a deserving group of extraordinary women who still have no voice – the African women farmers.&quot;Read the full announcement below by Dr Lindiwe Majele Sibanda.</p>

	A study conducted by the West and Central African Council for Agricultural Research and Development (WECARD) and published early November 2010 in Dakar, Senegal, found that women own less than two per cent of arable lands in West and Central Africa, although they are responsible for about 80 per cent of the agricultural production for the supply of households and markets. The study noted that women constitute about 70 per cent of agricultural workers and are producing 50 to 60 per cent of cattle breeding products. Ten per cent of agro-processors are women and they account for 60 to 90 per cent of trade in the rural areas. The study listed the problems women are confronted with including the burden of customary and traditional practices, the lack of access to credit, their limited participation in agricultural extension services and limited access to commercial facilities and services. The results will be used by WECARD to design the organization’s gender policy and strategy. (Source: Afriquejet, 6 November 2010).</p>

	In September 2010, the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC, Nairobi, Kenya) published its ‘Special Paper’ No.46. It features an article by Abena D. Oduro (from the Department of Economics at the University of Ghana in Legon, Ghana) in which the authors analyze the representation of women in AERC research programmes. This report on women in economic research and graduate training in West Africa summarizes the findings of studies conducted in Ghana and Liberia (Geegbae, 2007; Oduro, 2007). The reports on Ghana and Liberia are intended to provide the AERC with data and the information required to design specific strategies and activities to increase the participation of women. In this report, the population statistics of women and men in undergraduate and graduate economics programmes in Ghana and Liberia are detailed, then used to explain, along with results from female student surveys, a variety of phenomena such as preferred areas of specialization, plans after graduation, barriers to professional growth, and other challenges, like family responsibilities. A series of recommendations is given as conclusion to the report, covering identified needs such as the strengthening of capacity in quantitative methods, the production of more core textbooks by local researchers, and the increase in short and specialized courses.

	The regional meeting of the International Network of Women Engineers and Scientists (INWES) took place on 26-27 August 2010 at the headquarters of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Washington DC. Representatives from 11 countries, including England, Poland, France, Japan, South Korea, Rwanda, and Egypt attended the conference. The conference was ‘part of a much larger global effort to improve women's position in regard to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)...as well as to improve women's empowerment and development by way of STEM,’ said Shirley Malcom, director of Education and Human Resources at AAAS. It focused on workforce and economic development for women scientists and engineers. (Source: American Association for the Advancement of Science, 21 September 2010)</p>

	The African Youth Forum on Science and Technology (AYFST) launched almost one year ago on 28th June 2006 has taken off to a flying start with national events to harness the views and expand opportunities for greater youth involvement in science and technology policy debates in their countries. AYFST has organized, through its national focal points, national youth workshops on science and technology in six African countries in the 1st quarter of 2007. These national level meetings have been designed to respond to national issues in Kenya, Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Benin.</p>

					<p> 'It’s all in the mind,' psychologists say, if we can control the mind then an obstacle will be turned into an opportunity. It translates that the solution to youth obstacles is to change their mind sets! This is not an easy task, it takes a determined effort by the youth to first recognize the need for a change and then make that change. In this essay the obstacles facing youth in attaining wealth and employment will be identified, proposals will be made at to alleviate these obstacles and an organization involved in helping youth obtain wealth and employment will be highlighted.</p>

					<p> Agriculture in the Caribbean has now become the second income earning activity in many of its countries and to some, agriculture is becoming extinct.  The Caribbean islands have now almost placed agriculture on the back burner while placing emphasis on other areas such as tourism and finance which is not a bad thing. However, this transition has significantly hampered the agricultural sector causing the rural communities to divert their attention to more or less urbanization because they believe that more money can be made through the other activities.  Because of this, some of the Caribbean countries go through severe socio-economic and political situations and with these problems; the countries are faced with a high population growth rate, while the economic growth remains some what stagnant.  In addition to the high population growth rate, the countries are then faced with unemployment, and a lack of food security thus creating greater ordeal for the country.</p>

					<p> 'Getting unemployment down requires two things. It requires businesses to offer more jobs, and it requires the unemployed to have the needed skills to enable them to take the new jobs as they open.'  The Australian Chamber of Commerce puts the solution to unemployment simply and even though we know these answers are correct we also know that they are not as simple to achieve. </p>
