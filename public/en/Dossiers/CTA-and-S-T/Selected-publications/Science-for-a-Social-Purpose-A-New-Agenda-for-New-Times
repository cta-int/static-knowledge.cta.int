They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

<p><b>Introduction</b>: The African continent is home to 1.1 billion people spread over 54 countries. Despite its amazing resources, the continent entered the new millennium as the world’s poorest continent, with economies growing slowly or declining, and per capita incomes low or falling. However since 2004, things are changing and the economies have steadily grown by 4.5% on average annually. This rise can be attributed to many factors such as the global recovery, demand from consumers globally, good macroeconomic management, agricultural performance and improved political stability (Stiglitz and Charlton, 2006).</p><p>Africa today has a collective GDP roughly equal to Brazil’s or Russia and in 2008, a combined consumer spending of US$860 billion. Mobile phone penetration has increased and there has been over 300 million new subscribers since 2000. Africa still has 60% of the world’s total amount of uncultivated, arable land and 52 African cities have more than 1 million people each. Twenty African companies have revenues of at least US$3 billion. A total of 128 million Africans households will have discretionary income by 2020 and 50% of Africans will be living in cities by 2030 (Roxburg <i>et</i><i>al.</i>, 2010).</p><p>The projection for the future is that by 2020, Africa’s collective GDP will be around US$2.6 trillion, with US$1.4 trillion in terms of consumer spending. Africa’s youth and those of working age will be around 1.1 billion by 2040 (Roxburg <i>et al.</i>, 2010).</p><p>Nonetheless, GDP alone is misleading as a marker for prosperity. Although the continental GDP has improved in many countries, this has not been translated into higher income, or more employment or better access to health and education for example and yet these are key factors for sustained economic growth.</p><p><b>Health</b>: This is an area of major concern especially for sub-Saharan Africa. The rapid spread of HIV/AIDS has proven cataclysmic and life expectancy has dropped to an average of 46 years compared to the North African average of 71 years (UNAIDS, 2010). The Southern African regions did not fare better; Botswana has the lowest life expectancy at 38 years. The devastating impact of HIV/AIDS has been exacerbated by poverty and the breakdown of the health care systems. Preventable diseases such as malaria are one of the biggest challenges facing the African continent. The fact that so many people are dying from these diseases on the continent is no longer acceptable. Low-cost insecticide-treated nets or vitamin supplements remain largely unavailable. Meanwhile, over 1 million African children die each year from vaccine-preventable illnesses.</p><p>Poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition and inadequate water supply and sanitation, as well as poor health affect almost 50% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa. The continent accounts for only 1.1% of the total value of the global pharmaceuticals market. The implication is that the large pharmaceutical companies have not prioritised African health needs (Singer and Daar, 2010). Hence, ensuring reliable access to – and proper use of – safe, effective and affordable diagnostic tests, safe and efficacious herbal medicines and vaccines, is essential to health. The continent has sufficient knowledge and natural resources to alleviate some of the minor ailments if safe and efficacious medicines are made available.</p><p><b>Education</b>: Education in Africa is critical. In 2005, over 40 million children were estimated to be out of school. Many countries run the risk of not attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) on universal primary education and gender equality by 2015. Where more children are completing primary schools, there is growing demand for secondary and vocational training and education. Whilst enrolment in higher education is critical for building knowledge-driven industries and secure jobs for the youth, the enrolment rate at university level remains alarmingly low (Altbach <i>et al.</i>, 2011).</p><p><b>Science and Technology (Learning, Innovation and Development)</b>: The weak development of science, technology and innovation has delayed the emergence of African countries as knowledge economies (Juma and Yee-Cheong, 2005). A major contributor to this state of affairs has been the shortage of skills. Africa only contributes 0.1% of global health researchers and needs 1–2 million more health workers, for example, to provide for the health sector. In terms of scientific output, Africa accounts for 13.4% of the world’s people and yet produces only 1.1% of the scientific knowledge. Few African universities are among the top 500 worldwide and has only 35 scientists and engineers per million inhabitants, compared with 168 for Brazil, 2,457 for Europe and 4,103 for the United States (Kamoun, 2011).</p><p>In terms of wealth creation, the continent has lagged behind as institutions have been slow to commercialise its innovations. Investing remains at a paltry 0.42% of GDP in research and development, well below international targets. With resolutions taken by the AU leadership, a leap to 1% of GDP has been pledged to foster STI growth, but only a few African countries have approached this target (Malawi, South Africa, Tunisia and Uganda) (AU, 2007).</p><p>There are however, encouraging signs of growth not only in economic development, but also in science production. Africa collective GDP growth accelerated over the past decade reaching US$1.6 trillion in 2008 – a level similar to that found in Brazil or Russia. Increasingly, this growth surge can be attributed in large part to internal structural changes that have created macroeconomic stability and microeconomic reforms aimed at creating a more market-driven business environment.</p><p>The specific challenge, therefore, is how to take advantage of these positive indicators and move towards an inclusive and people-centered development agenda that fully harnesses the power of science and research across the continent and more importantly, how to transform this knowledge into commercially viable products and enterprises.</p><p><b>Science, Technology and Innovation (ST&amp;I) wealth creation</b>: It is an undeniable fact that ST&amp;I play a significant role in economic change and sustainable development. Knowledge creation and the translation of research into products and processes are key components for development. Economic transformation in developed and emerging countries are directly linked to technological innovation, processes and the management of human capital. One sector where this feature is visible is agricultural productivity. Between 1961 and 1998, without increasing the land area under cultivation, food production has almost doubled. Trade of high tech manufactured goods in the period 1980–1996 almost doubled. Many East Asian countries have capitalised on these opportunities and have transformed themselves into middle- to high-income countries.</p><p>However for these <i>miracles</i> to happen, the human capital issue comes across very strongly. African States need to focus on building their human capital (local and ways to attract highly talented diaspora) (Oyelaran-Oyeyinka, 2005). Investment in human capital (schools, universities, colleges etc.) must go side by side with infrastructure (e.g. roads, internet access etc.). These investments, along with the appropriate policies, would nurture the emergence of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are among the engines for economic development.</p><p><b>Potential for Biotechnology in development</b>: The potential for biotechnology to play an important role in development was recognised in the Action Programme in Agenda 21 at the Rio Earth Summit.</p><p class=" text-center">“<i>Promises to make a significant contribution in enabling the development of, for example, better health care, enhanced food security through sustainable agricultural practices, improved supplies of potable water, more efficient industrial development processes for transforming raw materials, support for sustainable methods of afforestation and reforestation and detoxification of hazardous wastes”.</i></p><p>Other developing countries that have made significant progress within the realm of biotechnology are Brazil, China and India. The emerging economies of India and China are leading in the commercialisation of innovative health products. Biotechnology is critical to Africa’s development but it would be unfair to say that research and development in biotechnology is not happening on the continent. Although research is taking place on the continent, they have yet to make a dent in the transformation of livelihoods. The examples in Box 1 highlight such initiatives but they have remained <i>stagnant</i> as the appropriate venture capital has not been found to transform the research into product development. Singer <i>et</i><i>al.</i> (2010) explain why this situation has arisen and highlight one important aspect i.e. access to capital.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p class=" text-center"><b>Box 1: Stagnant technologies in Africa</b> (Singer <i>et al.,</i> 2010).</p><p><i>Schistosomiasis dipstick test</i></p><p><i>Professor Kwabena Bosompem of the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, Ghana, has developed a dipstick assay for schistosomiasis disease, an endemic problem in Ghana caused by parasites, which are present in infected water. Although it has a low mortality rate, schistosomiasis is a chronic illness that can damage internal organs and, in children, impair their growth and cognitive development. Schistosomiasis is the second-most socio-economically devastating disease after malaria. Despite having developed a prototype test for the disease several years ago, the commercial potential of the test has not been exploited due to a lack of technology transfer capacity or support for product development, field trials or market assessment.</i></p><p><i>Artemisia annua</i></p><p><i>Artemisia annua grows in the highlands in Arusha, Tanzania, with 2–10 times higher yield than anywhere else in the world (transcripts from participant interviews, Tanzania). At the National Institute for Medical Research, scientists developed an innovative process to enhance the production of Artemisia, which is not being locally applied. Once grown, however, all Tanzanian Artemisia is dried and exported to Kenya, where extraction occurs, before being shipped to Switzerland where it is further processed for use in the antimalarial drug Coartem® produced by Novartis. Little commercial value is captured locally, and though there are efforts to commercialise Artemisia locally using innovative processes these remain uncoordinated across the private sector, government and universities.</i></p><p><i>Agricultural research</i></p><p><i>This included a fertiliser formulated at the Institute of Research into Science and Technology in Rwanda by a scientist who refused to disclose its formula. Due to lack of awareness of the innovation process and support structures to protect inventions, the potential value of this discovery was untapped. In another example, seed varieties developed at Rwanda’s Institute of Agriculture and Scientific Research are being marketed in Malawi – no royalties are flowing back to the institute, hence no local value has been captured.</i></p><p><i><b>&nbsp;</b></i></p><p><b>Access to capital</b>: African Life Sciences, with applications as diverse as health, infrastructure to commercialise R&amp;D, turning it into products and services for local benefit and, ultimately, regional and global export innovation can become the drivers for wealth and economic development. However for this to happen, key ingredients are: a vibrant private sector, flexible financing mechanisms for small businesses, support structures for small business development and expertise in management, technology transfer, intellectual property and regulation (Hecht <i>et</i><i>al.</i>, 2009).</p><p>Policy-makers need to be apprised that the ‘linear’ policy for funding research and development is no longer valid and the disparate elements of science, business and capital need to be brought together and collectively energised and that the commercialisation of research in Africa would be through ‘convergence innovation’. The latter concept addresses the missing links between science, business and capital and provides a specific focus on product development (Singer and Daar, 2010).</p><p>Whilst the majority of existing funds invest in traditional sectors such as agriculture, mining and energy, there seem to be little space for biotechnology on the continent, except for South Africa where investment has been made in the life sciences sector. This can be understood when one looks at the history and image of the continent: poverty, war, diseases, lack of infrastructure and inexperienced human capital. Yet there are so many unique opportunities, assets and viable options that can make a difference to livelihoods.</p><p><b>Leveraging traditional knowledge</b>: This continent is blessed with abundant resources as well as untapped natural biodiversity. With the growing number of African governments and international development agencies now recognising that local knowledge and organisations are a vital foundation for participatory approaches to sustainable and cost-effective development, the region stands to gain much by exploiting its application on a much wider scale. Strengthening the framework for developing, applying and sustaining indigenous knowledge will prevent loss of this asset, which is invaluable to social development (Gorjestani, 2000; World Bank, 2011).</p><p>The region’s older generation who are the traditional custodians of indigenous knowledge are dying off without leaving written records of their knowledge; at the same time rapid environmental, socio-economic and political changes are occurring in many communities in the region, which place indigenous knowledge in danger of extinction and obliteration by globalisation and new technologies (UNEP, 2008). The recent signing and ratification of the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing has been a wake-up call for the countries/institutions/individuals who are custodians to ancient traditional knowledge and to the potential that this knowledge has in transforming their economies.</p><p>In Mauritius, the rich local biodiversity, diverse traditional knowledge, wealth of data on biological assays on medicinal plants and the existence of a contract research organisation performing phase 3 and 4 clinical trials on drugs and cosmetics were the right ingredients for the establishment of the Centre for Phytotherapy Research Ltd. With a combination of private capital and VC, CEPHYR Ltd came to life in 2009. The aims of CEPHYR Ltd are highlighted in Box 2.</p><p>The business case for CEPHYR Ltd articulated on the premises that: the demand for phytomedicine was being driven by the grass roots; the pharmaceutical, perfume and cosmetic and nutrition companies are also on the look-out for new, innovative ingredients and active molecules; standardised medications are increasingly being shown to be a good response to antibiotic resistance, for example. The existing clinical testing facility in the sister company was an excellent opportunity to start bidding for external contracts on which the engines of CEPHYR Ltd have started firing on.</p><p>This bet has worked, as contracts started to come in not only for the search of innovative ingredients but also for the testing of phyto-products, amongst others.</p><p><b>Conclusion</b>: Africa’s history has been marked by a development narrative in which science and technology as well as innovation were often viewed as a preserve for the very few as opposed to using S&amp;T as a tool for development. Fortunately this narrative is changing and increasingly, African leaders are increasingly committed to using ST&amp;I as tools for human development and with potential to impact their efforts, programmes and initiatives in attaining global competitiveness and ecological management.</p><p>For this transformation to take place effectively, the innovation communities could be anchored by geographically defined ‘local innovation areas’ with clustering of professionals and universities as well as talents from the agricultural, health, industrial and environmental biotechnologies. Leveraging diaspora’s as well as international financial contribution is key (Barugahara and Tostensen, 2009; Mugabe, 2009).</p><p>The strengthening of institutions is called for as well as for increasing enrolment by women. The merging of research, education and the reforming of existing knowledge-based institutions, especially universities, to serve as centres of technology development and entrepreneurship will all be key to make Africa emerge from the adage of a ‘dark continent’ to becoming a ‘beacon of hope’ for the youth of today and tomorrow.</p><p>The following elements should be part of such a new agenda of change in Africa: (i) capitalise on the momentum gained in global environmental and conservation movements (<i>recognise all actions are local); </i>(ii)<i>&nbsp;</i>emphasise maintenance and sustainable use of ‘natural capital’ (<i>recognise the important role of local communities)</i>; (iii) mobilise cutting-edge knowledge (<i>recognise the value of indigenous knowledge and cultural traditions)</i>; and (iv) forge partnerships anchored in the common good for the benefit of all (<i>become the voice of change).</i></p><p><b>References</b>:</p><p>Altbach, G.P. and Salmmi, L.
