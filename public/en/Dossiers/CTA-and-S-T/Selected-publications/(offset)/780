						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

Issue 31 of AJFAND is ready. We at the Secretariat have great expectations and anticipation for year 2010. During the last Foreword (issue 30), I appealed for support to host student interns. The response has been encouraging and has come in form of students applying for attachment, and a number of potential donors seeking details on how we can work together to achieve this goal. If this model works, it will fit squarely in AJFAND’s initial objective to operate as a capacity building undertaking to improve manuscript preparation, and analytical, reviewing and editing capabilities. The deliverables would be clearly visible. I continue to appeal for support in this area. Contact us, please, for discussions on how we can move forward together. Another request is for readers of AJFAND to send in comments which we can carry on the “comments” page of the journal. These constitute spontaneous, quick-to-read comments which we take fairly seriously. Issue 31 has a Guest Editor, Prof. Henry Laswai, a seasoned scholar of Sokoine University, Tanzania. We wish to foster a sense of ownership by inviting participation in various aspects of the journal. New ideas are welcome on how to increase not only the readership, but also contributions to the journal.

					<p>By IISD, January 2010. A new study by IISDs Water Innovation Centre, presents the case for technological and institutional innovation for effective ecological watershed management. Key elements of this innovation agenda include governance reform at the water-land interface, re-purposing existing resources, and designing new economic instruments to support watershed management, including ecological goods and services programs in the agricultural sector. Manitoba is a region of high water variability—floods and droughts have always characterized the region. Climate change threatens to make that variability more extreme and may already be happening. At present, over 90 per cent of the available water budget returns to the atmosphere as evaporation; only 8 per cent is available as watershed runoff. As climate change brings more and more variable rainfall, ecological watershed management (for water conservation, groundwater recharge, and flood and drought protection) becomes an ever more important adaptation strategy and has the major co-benefit of also reducing nutrient loads on Lake Winnipeg.</p>

					<p>By IFPRI, 2009. The majority of poor people in developing countries rely on agriculture for their food and livelihoods. However, they are increasingly vulnerable and food insecure due to declining agricultural productivity growth, climate change susceptibility, and volatile food and energy prices. As part of its commitment to improving livelihoods and reducing poverty, IFPRI is undertaking substantial work on food- and nutrition-related science and technology policy, with an emphasis on innovations that are relevant, safe, and accessible to poor people. Assessing the socioeconomic opportunities and risks of agricultural biotechnology for smallholder farming systems, poor consumers, biodiversity, and trade is a priority on IFPRI’s research agenda. IFPRI’s biotechnology research is also complemented by its work on biosafety policy issues.</p>

					<p>By IIED, December 2009. This special issue of Participatory Learning and Action focuses on recent approaches to climate change adaptation which are community-based and participatory, building on the priorities, knowledge, and capacities of local people. It discusses how community-based approaches to climate change have emerged, and the similarities and differences between CBA and other participatory development and disaster risk reduction approaches. It highlights innovative participatory methods which are developing to help communities analyse the causes and effects of climate change, integrate scientific and community knowledge of climate change, and plan adaptation measures. Whilst CBA is a relatively new field, some lessons and challenges are beginning to emerge, including how to integrate disaster risk reduction, livelihoods and climate change adaptation work, climate change knowledge gaps, issues around the type and quality of participation, and the need for policies and institutions that support CBA. </p>

					<p>By FAO, 2009. Food systems of Indigenous Peoples who retain connection to long-evolved cultures and patterns of living in local ecosystems present a treasure of knowledge that contributes to well-being and health, and can benefit all humankind. This book seeks to define and describe the diversity in food system use, nutrition and health in 12 rural case studies (f.e. Nigeria, Kenya and the Federated States of Micronesia) of Indigenous Peoples in different parts of the world as a window to global Indigenous Peoples’ circumstances. The collective intent of this documentation is to show the inherent strengths of the local traditional food systems, how people think about and use these foods, the influx of industrial and purchased food, and the circumstances of the nutrition transition in indigenous communities. </p>

					<p>By Notenbaert, A., Thornton, P., Herrero, M., ILRI, 2007. The main purpose of the study presented here is to shed some light using simple and aggregated methods on the following question: In view of the expected climate change, is there also a long-term perspective for livestock development in the area, i.e. will the Turkana ecosystem be able to sustain livestock production during the next few decades? In our search for an answer to this question, we looked at the current pressure on the environment, tried to interpolate the predicted climate change to the Turkana District scale and started exploring some of the possible impacts of climate change on the environment and the people depending on it. Due to the simplistic nature of the analyses performed, we consider these figures to be indicative only. This study goes hand in hand with another one focussing on market access and opportunities. </p>

					<p>The authors of this book approach the debate on Innovation and knowledge for economic growth acutely aware of the complexity of this process. They argue that economic development is largely driven by innovation, concentrating on the dynamics of process, product and organizational changes and how they are embedded within specific and varied contextual institutions. However, they emphasize the centrality of knowledge, technology and innovation to the process of economic development. What is at issue is the precise mechanics of overcoming economic development challenges in different contexts. Income convergence between the poorer South and the wealthy North has proved a mirage; a new economic divide has in fact occurred within the South itself. The debate relating to latecomers is thus framed in discussions about regions and countries that arrive late to mastering industrialization in achieving economic prosperity through the use of knowledge.</p>

					<p>ByE. Kyomugisha, IFPRI brief, 2009In Uganda most increases in aggregate crop production have been achieved from the expansion of cultivated land rather than increased investment in production technologies to raise crop yields per unit area of land. As access to land is increasingly constrained by high population growth, further expansion of cultivated land will be unsustainable. Research has shown that secure land tenure is an important institutional factor affecting agricultural technology utilization by smallholder farmers by providing incentives for greater investment to enhance the productivity of the land. This brief seeks to determine the relevance of security of land tenure to agricultural development in Uganda.</p>

Africa’s stock of human capital with secondary- and tertiary-level skills is comparatively small. Its quality is highly variable, and the accumulation of skills in some countries is dampened by mortality arising from infectious diseases and by emigration of many of the most talented. Only by raising the rate of investment in human capital can the region reach and sustain the level of economic performance it needs to generate an adequate volumeof employment for expanding populations. This report identifies and analyzes the challenges that countries in SSA face in seeking to achieve these aspirations. It underscores the role of tertiary education in meeting these challenges and, by drawing on African and international experience, it indicates the policy steps that will enable African tertiary institutions to support knowledge-intensive growth strategies.</p>

	An academic revolution has taken place in higher education in the past half century marked by transformations unprecedented in scope and diversity. Comprehending this ongoing and dynamic process while being in the midst of it is not an easy task. Arguably, the developments of the recent past are at least as dramatic as those in the 19th century when the research university evolved, first in Germany and then elsewhere, and fundamentally redesigned the nature of the university worldwide. The academic changes of the late 20th and early 21st centuries are more extensive due to their global nature and the number of institutions and people they affect. This report is especially devoted to examining the changes that have taken place since the 1998 UNESCO World Conference on Higher Education. While many trends included in this report were discussed in 1998, this report examines the main engines of change and their impact on higher education.</p>

					<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenous gaseous molecule and regulates a variety of biological processes in animals. However, whether CO regulates nutrient stress responses in plants is largely unknown. In this paper, we described an observation that CO can regulate iron-homeostasis in iron-starved <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Exogenous CO at 50 lM was able to prevent the iron deficient-induced chlorosis and improve chlorophyll accumulation. Expression of AtIRT1, AtFRO2, AtFIT1 and AtFER1 was up-regulated by CO exposure in iron-deficient seedlings. CO-regulated <i>iron homeostasis</i> could also be found in monocot maize and green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. Treatment with external CO increased iron accumulation in iron-deficient <i>Arabidopsis </i>and<i> C. reinhardtii</i>, and restored leaf greening in Maize ys1 and ys3 mutants (defective in Fe uptake). Moreover, endogenous CO level was increased in <i>Arabidopsis</i> under iron-deficiency. Finally, CO exposure induced NO accumulation in root tips. However, such an action could be blocked by NO scavenger cPTIO. These results indicate that CO may play an important role in improving plant adaptation to iron deficiency or cross-talking with NO under the iron deficiency.Authors: Wei Wei Kong, Li Ping Zhang, Kai Guo, Zhao Pu Liu and Zhi Min Yang.
