						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p> 19 December 2007 Wageningen International organized a discussion meeting on the World Development Report 2008 Agriculture for Development. The WDR2008 report which, the day before, was officially presented by a World Bank delegation to the Netherlands’ Ministry of Development Cooperation was scrutinized on its implications for research by some 70 participants – including staff and students of Wageningen UR, other members of the Agri-Profocus family, representatives from the Netherlands’ Ministries of Development Cooperation/DGIS and Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, the Technical Centre for Agriculture and Rural Cooperation (CTA) and staff and students of other Netherlands knowledge institutes (KIT, ISS) and NGOs. The Powerpoint Presentations of the various speakers can be downloaded here. Reports of the break-out sessions on the implications for research and policy can be downloaded from the website.</p>

					<p> 
Ed. Andrew Mold, Amsterdam University Press, 2007 On many fronts, EU development policy is at a critical juncture. In the face of major new challenges, such as the current impasse in the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, and increasing concerns over security threats, the European Union is having to rethink much of its development policy both with its ‘near neighbours’ and in the South. How has the process of enlargement impacted on EU development policy? What would a ‘development-friendly’ trade policy look like? What kind of relations should the EU aspire to with North Africa and Middle East? Can the EU design a coherent approach towards developing countries or will its other interests, such as protectionism in agriculture or its neighbourhood policy, constrain its development policy? This volume, drawing on the expertise of well-known specialists in their respective fields, provides a critical overview of EU development policy and the challenges that it must confront in an increasingly volatile and changing world. </p>

					<p> 
Robert Paarlberg, Harvard University Press, February 2008 In many parts of Africa farmers are mostly women, hardworking but visibly poor. They have no improved seeds, no chemical fertilizers, no irrigation, and with their meager crops they earn less than a dollar a day. Many are malnourished. Nearly two-thirds of Africans are employed in agriculture, yet on a per-capita basis they produce roughly 20% less than they did in 1970. Although modern agricultural science was the key to reducing rural poverty in Asia, modern farm science – including biotechnology – has recently been kept out of Africa. In this book Paarlberg explains why poor African farmers are denied access to productive technologies, particularly genetically engineered seeds with improved resistance to insects and drought. He traces this obstacle to the current opposition to farm science in prosperous countries. Having embraced agricultural science to become well-fed themselves, those in wealthy countries are now instructing Africans – on the most dubious grounds – not to do the same. </p>

					<p> The Eco-Patent Commons is an initiative to create a collection of patents that directly or indirectly protect the environment. The patents will be pledged by companies and other intellectual property rights holders and made available to anyone free of charge. The Commons is a resource for connecting those who have had success with a particular challenge in a way that benefits the environment and those who are facing similar challenges. Sharing knowledge and technology that protect the environment is one way to address a wide range of challenges and threats to our planet. One vital way to share such knowledge and technology is through making patented technology available. Yet, to date, there has been no organized effort to make patents available, without royalty, to help enable the world community to reduce waste, pollution, global warming, and energy demands. Asking an enterprise to relinquish such key assets is not the objective of the Commons. However, leading businesses may hold some patents that provide environmental benefit and do not represent an essential source of business advantage for them. Though these patents may provide nominal license or exclusivity potential for companies, they may provide greater value in a public commons. As has been demonstrated by the open source software community, the free sharing of knowledge can provide a fertile ground for new collaboration and innovation. Sharing environmental patents can help others become more eco-efficient and operate in a more environmentally sustainable manner — enabling technology innovation to meet social innovation.</p>

					<p> 
Johannes Rosebomm, 2007The EU Sugar Reform has negative consequences for the sugar industries in Sugar Protocol (SP) countries as their export revenues will decline sharply. In order to adapt to new market realities the EU is offering the SP countries a significant development assistance package (€ 1.2 billion) to restructure their industries as well as various other forms of assistance. One of them is a five-year ACP sugar research programme to be funded by the European Development Fund. This programme aims to improve the overall competitiveness of the sugar industry in ACP countries (and in particular in the SP countries among them) in order to survive in a less-protected global sugar market. At the same time, the Everything-But-Arms (EBA) agreement has created new opportunities for sugar-producing EBA countries to export to the EU sugar market. </p>

					<p> 
In: World Development Report 2008: Agriculture for Development, World Bank, November 2007. Investments in agriculture research and development have turned agriculture in much of the developing world into a dynamic sector, with rapid technological innovation accelerating growth and reducing poverty. However, the technological challenges facing agriculture in the 21st century are probably even more daunting than those of recent decades. Land and water are becoming increasingly scarce, so the main source of growth to satisfy increased demand for food and agricultural products will be through gains in productivity. </p>

					<p> 
Andrew Mushita and Carol B. Thompson, Africa World Press, 2007The struggle for control of biodiversity is passionate: Corporate leaders assume they can make billions; many scientists aspire to manufacturing ‘new’ species; the promise of new cures tantalizes. But no scientist, no patent lawyer, or economist can depict the whole picture. This book gives voice to those in Africa who know better—and are willing to help others see the horror of the biopiracy and enclosure behind the camouflage of advancing ‘innovation,’ ‘land reform,’ and ‘free trade.’ Sharing bioresources requires not only different views of science, of law, of trade, but also of community. </p>

K. Havnevik et al., Nordic Africa Institute / Nordiska Afrikainstitutet, Uppsala, 2007Smallholder agriculture is the dominant occupation in many sub-Saharan African nations. The influence of World Bank policies on this sector is well documented, particularly with reference to structural adjustment policies of the 1980s and 90s. Despite widespread criticism of the World Bank's agriculture policy prescriptions, its major annual publication, the World Development Report (WDR), remains focused on this economic sector. This paper offers a critical reflection of the WDR’s portrayal of world agriculture with respect to Africa.  </p>

GRAIN Briefing, November 2007For some time now, there's been talk of a new Green Revolution for Africa – because ‘Africa missed the first Green Revolution’ or because ‘the first Green Revolution missed Africa’. Now a new project, the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), is trying to put the concept into operation. This paper describes what a Green Revolution really signifies, why such projects haven't worked before and why AGRA won't work either, in order to help people trying to take positions at the local, national and regional levels. </p>

					<p> 
F. William Engdahl, Global Research, November 2007 This skillfully researched book focuses on how a small socio-political American elite seeks to establish control over the very basis of human survival: the provision of our daily bread. ‘Control the food and you control the people.’ This is no ordinary book about the perils of GMO. Engdahl takes the reader inside the corridors of power, into the backrooms of the science labs, behind closed doors in the corporate boardrooms. The author cogently reveals a diabolical world of profit-driven political intrigue, government corruption and coercion, where genetic manipulation and the patenting of life forms are used to gain worldwide control over food production. If the book often reads as a crime story, that should come as no surprise. For that is what it is. Engdahl's carefully argued critique goes far beyond the familiar controversies surrounding the practice of genetic modification as a scientific technique. The book is an eye-opener, a must-read for all those committed to the causes of social justice and World peace. </p>

					<p> 
Alessandra Giuliani, Earthscan/ Bioversity International (IPGRI), 2007Reduced agrobiodiversity can leave communities highly vulnerable to changing climatic, economic and political pressures. This book, based on research in Syria, presents practical proposals for establishing markets and securing livelihoods in difficult dryland areas. Four crops - maize, potatoes, rice and wheat - provide more than 90% of the world's food. Increasingly, old varieties of even these crops are disappearing as farmers and consumers strive for more uniformity in food products. This narrowing of the diversity of agricultural systems' main components has a knock-on effect on less obvious elements, such as insects that play a role in pollinating plants or controlling pests, and the soil organisms that help plants extract nutrients from the soil. Also, farmers need a broad base of agrobiodiversity to be able to respond and adapt to environmental changes and to improve their production. This is especially important in the face of climate change and changing economic and political pressures. The book describes how communities are developing markets for local products derived from neglected and underutilized plants. Based on case studies, the data and processes documented in the book show the potential of biodiversity to make a significant contribution to livelihood security in communities that inhabit difficult environments with unique resources. The study also highlights the importance of local cultural knowledge and institutions in sustainable development of biodiversity markets. </p>

					<p> 
D. Bigman, CABI Publishing, December 2007 One of the most notable changes in the world economy during the past three decades has been the diverging trends in the growth of the developing countries. Compared to East Asian countries that have integrated well into the global economy, those of Sub-Saharan Africa have remained stagnant and have become the world's least developed area. The policies and programmes of international organizations have failed to improve the situation while the global economy becomes dominated by trans-national corporations. A review of the suitability of globalization as an economic strategy for these under-developed countries is therefore needed. Focusing on the impact of globalization and on the constraints imposed by the changes in the world's production and trade, this book examines the opportunities open to the least developed countries as they design their strategies to accelerate growth and alleviate poverty. As the world's awareness of issues concerning globalization grows, this study will provide valuable insights.  </p>

The Bank’s strategy for agriculture has been increasingly subsumed within a broader rural focus, which has diminished its importance. Both arising from and contributing to this, the technical skills needed to support agricultural development adequately have also declined over time. The Bank’s limited—and, until recently, declining— support for addressing the constraints on agriculture has not been used strategically to meet the diverse needs of a sector that requires coordinated intervention across a range of activities. The lending support from the Bank has been ‘sprinkled’ across various agricultural activities such as research, extension, credit, seeds, and policy reforms in rural space, but with little recognition of the potential synergy among them to effectively contribute to agricultural development. As a result, though there have been areas of comparatively greater success — research, for example—results have been limited because of weak linkage with extension and limited availability of such complementary and critical inputs as fertilizers and water. Hence the Bank has had limited success in contributing to the development of African agriculture. </p>

					<p> 
M. Morris et al., World Bank, 2007The limited use of fertilizer by farmers in Africa stands in striking contrast to the much more extensive use of fertilizer by farmers in other developing regions. This contrast has stimulated considerable discussion about what should be the role of fertilizer in helping the countries of Africa achieve their agricultural development goals, and what types of policies and programs can help realize the potential benefits of fertilizer in African agriculture. This book summarizes the findings of a major study to identify promising policy options for promoting increased fertilizer use in Africa, with the ultimate goal of boosting agricultural productivity in smallholder farming systems and reducing poverty. The book summarizes lessons learned from past efforts to promote fertilizer in Africa, provides an overview of the current state of knowledge about technical aspects of fertilizer use in Africa, and presents good practice guidelines for promoting sustainable increases in fertilizer use. The good practice guidelines—which form the basis of an interactive policymaker’s tool kit included on a CD accompanying the book—relate not only to the more focused problem of encouraging increased fertilizer use by farmers, but also to the broader challenge of creating the type of enabling environment that is needed to support the emergence of efficient, dynamic, and commercially viable fertilizer marketing systems.  </p>

					<p> 
World Bank/UNU-MERIT, 2006 This book is based on an international workshop, ‘Development of Research Systems to Support the Changing Agricultural Sector,’ in June 2004, which concluded that ‘strengthened research systems may increase the supply of new knowledge and new technologies, but such strengthening may not necessarily correlate very well with the capacity to innovate and adopt innovations throughout the agricultural sector, and thereby with economic growth.’ This book uses an innovation systems perspective to explore which other interventions may be required. The innovation systems concept is not new, but is considered to have great potential to add value to previous concepts of agricultural research systems and growth by drawing attention to the totality of actors needed for innovation and growth, consolidating the role of the private sector and stressing the importance of interactions within a sector, and emphasizing the outcomes of technology and knowledge generation and adoption rather than the strengthening of research systems and their outputs. Although the concept has raised interest within the agricultural sector, the operational aspects of the concept remain largely unexplored. At the same time, agricultural investment strategies have gone through a number of changes, some of which are closely related to the innovation systems concept. This book takes stock of real-world innovation systems and assesses the usefulness of the innovation systems concept for guiding investments in agricultural technology development and economic growth. The paper incorporates prior innovation systems work and eight new case studies of innovation systems, plus potential investments to support their development.  </p>
