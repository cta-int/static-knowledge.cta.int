						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p> 
Increased biofuel production, driven by the rise in oil prices and the threat of climate change, has also caused the price of food to increase, especially those food crops used in biofuel production such as maize and sugarcane. This paper examines the likely effect of raised prices such as these on South African (SA) consumers, especially on the very poor who are particularly dependent on staples like maize and sugar. Four recommendations are made on how the SA government strategy could be modified to ensure that the potential benefits of bioenergy are captured by the poor in rural areas, rather than monopolised by rich, urban consumers.Source: A.

					<p> 
Land degradation is a severe problem in the densely populated highlands of East Africa and elsewhere on the African continent. Soil erosion resulting from cultivation on steeply sloping terrain, mining of soil fertility due to continuous cultivation with limited application of inorganic or organic sources of soil nutrients, and deforestation and overgrazing of rangelands are among the key factors causing low agricultural productivity, widespread poverty, and food insecurity in the region. Finding ways to achieve more sustainable and productive land management is an urgent need, requiring policy, institutional, and technological strategies that are well targeted to the heterogeneous landscapes and diverse biophysical and socioeconomic contexts found in the East African highlands. This volume helps to address this information need.Source: John Pender, Frank Place, and Simeon Ehui (eds.) (2006) IFPRI </p>

This paper assesses the usefulness of the innovation systems concept in guiding investments to support the development of agricultural technology. To that end, it develops an operational agricultural innovation systems concept for the World Bank’s client countries and collaborators. This paper does not challenge the importance of investing in science and technology capacity, which is recognized in innovation systems theory. Rather it focuses on the additional insights and types of interventions that can be derived from an innovation systems perspective and that can influence the generation and use of science and technology for economic development. The paper incorporates prior innovation systems work and eight new case studies of innovation systems and potential investments to support their development. The manuscript has been produced through collaboration between the World Bank’s Agriculture and Rural Development Department and UNU-MERIT.Source: IBRD/World Bank (2006) </p>

					<p> 
While almost all of the investment in agricultural biotechnology to date has been in temperate crops suitable for developed countries, developing countries are the greatest potential beneficiaries of this major technological advance. To realise this potential requires investment in crops appropriate to climatic and agronomic conditions in developing countries. Protection of intellectual property rights is a necessary condition for the private sector to invest in appropriate biotechnologies. This paper develops a game theoretic model of a bioscience firm that adapts a new technology to a range of agronomic conditions in response to the enforcement of intellectual property rights in a developed and a developing country. Over a range of potential penalties, low levels of enforcement by the developing country remain endemic despite the desire to have the bioscience firm adapt the biotechnology to its local conditions. In particular, the trade penalties contained in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights are likely to be ineffective. The developing country might increase enforcement if the developed country was more aggressive in liberalising agriculture trade because there would be greater symmetry in the benefits of the technology.Source: J.D.

					<p> 
This paper was drafted by the members of UN-Energy, which includes all of the UN agencies working the area of energy, and is intended to contribute to international discussions on the strategies and policies needed to ensure economic, sustainable, and equitable development of bioenergy in the years ahead. The paper describes bioenergy and its potential benefits and trade-offs and provides a framework for decision-makers to consider nine key sustainability issues facing bioenergy development, including: 1) the ability of modern bioenergy to provide energy services for the poor; 2) implications for agro-industrial development; and 3) implications for food security. When establishing a policy framework for the development of bioenergy, a number of food security and agriculture-related issues need to be considered. These include the risks to food security of various bioenergy scenarios and possible ways to avert them; and the positive impacts of expanded bioenergy due to diversification and new rural infrastructure.Source: UN-Energy (2007) </p>

					<p> 
In semi-arid East and West Africa, population pressure is increasingly forcing agriculture into marginal and forested areas. Crop yields, both per hectare and per capital are declining and environmental degradation is on the rise. Sustainable intensification of agriculture is desperately needed by a population that largely depends on agriculture for both food and income, but decades of development assistance and millions of dollars of investment have done little to reverse the environmental problems or intensify traditional farming systems. Such at least is the picture painted by a paper in this collection from three American scientific societies. The first 300 pages of this substantial volume go over the background of dryland farming, including efficient use of water, soil and water conservation, soil fertility and crop choice. The remaining chapters provide a broad overview of the characteristics of, and challenges facing dryland agriculture throughout the world. With such massive scope, detail is limited, making this a useful reference for students and lecturers more than, perhaps, a tool for researchers. However, there are suggestions for future research directions. In the case of East and West Africa, the author emphasises the need to reverse land degradation and soil fertility decline, and points out the need for better communication between the physical and socio-economic branches of science.Source: G.A.

Global drylands face a myriad of problems that present tough research, management, and policy challenges. Recent advances in dryland development, however, together with the integrative approaches of global change and sustainability science, suggest that concerns about land degradation, poverty, safeguarding biodiversity, and protecting the culture of 2.5 billion people can be confronted with renewed optimism. We review recent lessons about the functioning of dryland ecosystems and the livelihood systems of their human residents and introduce a new synthetic framework, the Drylands Development Paradigm (DDP). The DDP, supported by a growing and well-documented set of tools for policy and management action, helps navigate the inherent complexity of desertification and dryland development, identifying and synthesizing those factors important to research, management, and policy communities.Source: J.F.

					<p> 
As a way of stimulating and mainstreaming the new products, services, and practices that drive greater productivity, efficiency, and overall economic growth, innovation has enormous implications in the African context. As a follow up to an international conference in South Africa (May 2006) on innovation in Africa, this forum aimed to advance innovation policy agendas in selected African countries and develop the capacity of relevant leaders and institutions. The World Bank’s Knowledge for Development (K4D) Program examines the application of knowledge as a key source of growth in the global economy. Innovation is a crucial part of any country’s development and should be understood broadly as something new to a local context. The concept of innovation also encompasses not only ‘technological’ innovation, (i.e. the diffusion of new products and services of a technological nature into the economy), but equally includes non-technological forms of innovation such as ‘organization’ innovations that encompass new approaches to management and marketing, supply and logistics, communications and positioning, etc. The innovation system in any country consists of the institutions, rules, and procedures that affect how it acquires, creates, disseminates, and applies knowledge. Innovation policies in developing countries must deal primarily with the building of an appropriate technical culture and the creation of incentives to promote entrepreneurship and cooperation among key actors.Source: Report of workshop sponsored by Irish Aid and the World Bank Institute, March 6-8, 2007, Dublin, Ireland  </p>

In Africa, millions rely directly on rainfed agriculture for their livelihoods; climate-sensitive diseases are a major public health problem; and climate-related disasters regularly threaten development gains. Yet climate information often fails to reach them. The partners behind this new publication would like to see this change. Case studies in this new publication -- which was produced by African and global partners -- highlight efforts already underway that are helping populations better adapt, and show that when climate information successfully reaches vulnerable populations, it can be used to improve livelihoods and economies, and even save lives. The publication was launched at the African Union Heads of State Summit, which focused on two central themes: science, technology and scientific research for development; and climate change in Africa. This publication aims to bring these efforts to the surface, and to inform key stakeholders, including the media, government agencies, and others, about the positive and negative experiences of new and ongoing examples of climate risk management in Africa.Source: M.E.

					<p> InterAcademy Council , 2005. The science, technology, and innovation capacities of nations will be strengthened through the greater participation of women in all aspects of science, engineering, and medicine. National academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine can perform an important role in this effort. In this spirit, in 2004 the Board of the InterAcademy Council formed an Advisory Panel on Women for Science. This panel recently published a consensus report with a set clear recommendations and specific action items. It urges academies to assume a leading role in:  

 
 Fully including women in science and technology and advancing them into senior and leadership positions  
 
 Acting individually and jointly to engage the public, specifically women and girls, in the science and technology enterprise  
 
 Empowering not only professional women but also women at the grassroot levels in the rural and urban areas of the developing world.

7th Meeting of the Africa Partnership Forum, Moscow, Russia, 26-27 October 2006.This Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) monitoring report presents a mixed picture, but finds that there has been some progress on CAADP pillar 4 (research and technology), and partial progress under CAADP pillar 1 (land and water management). It finds, on balance, little progress to date under the other CAADP pillars. It also finds no evidence of significant progress in developing national resources and capacities. It is important to recognize the importance of awareness and buy-in for CAADP, and that implementation will inevitably take time. Nonetheless, on the basis of the evidence to date, the report assesses the overall score as ‘red’. Although this issue is a very high priority for African leaders, and for the achievement of the MDGs, it has not yet benefited from the sustained efforts needed to generate significant progress. In this sense, this report constitutes a ‘wake-up call’. </p>

M.W. Rosegrant et al, World Bank/IFPRI, 2006.To allow the agriculture sector to develop its full potential for achieving the MDGs, the share of ODA spent on agriculture needs to increase significantly. It is a promising development that the review of progress – and lack thereof – in achieving the MDGs has reached global attention. Calls for accountability and action that have real impact on people are growing because of that attention. Policy action and increased investment in the critical arenas of sustainable agriculture productivity and food and nutrition security will be essential for responding effectively and responsibly to reach the MDGs. </p>

Gatsby Charitable Foundation (2005) Gatsby Occasional Paper.This paper describes a novel approach to crop management that exploits the natural relationships between plants and insects. When scientists investigated the ecology of a widespread cereal pest, they discovered that introducing a carefully selected mix of forage plants into maize fields had a dramatic effect on cereal yields and total farm output. The so-called ‘push– pull’ technology that emerged from their research makes use of natural plant chemicals that drive insect pests away from the crop and attract them to other host plants, which withstand attack better than maize. Along the way, the scientists discovered intriguing new properties in the forage legume, desmodium. Besides being nutritious for dairy cows, it repels insect pests of maize and substantially reduces damage from striga, a destructive parasitic weed. In short, the push–pull system can improve food security and farm income in an environmentally friendly way, making it an ideal ingredient in the long-term struggle to reduce hunger and poverty in Africa. </p>

D.P. Delmer (2005) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 102(44): 15739. Enhancing agricultural productivity in those areas of the world bypassed by the Green Revolution will require new approaches that provide incentives and funding mechanisms that promote the translation of new innovations in plant science into concrete benefits for poor farmers. This article is an attempt to analyze both the constraints and the opportunities presented by the challenge to translate new discoveries in plant sciences into successes in agriculture for the benefit of the poor of the world. </p>
