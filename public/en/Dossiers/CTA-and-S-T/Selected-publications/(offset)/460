						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p><b>(Keynote paper, finals of the ‘Young Professionals in Science’ competition)</b>Climate change affects all sectors of society at local, regional and continental scales, but available evidence is not sufficient to guide policies. Unravelling past climatic events is essential if we are to understand the present and to derive reliable scenarios of future climate change. Thus interdisciplinary and international collaborations are needed to extend research frontiers and to develop regional and sub-regional climate models at a scale relevant for decision-makers. Tree rings and stable isotopes in tree rings provide evidence of past climate variability. Given the short instrumental climate records that exist in Africa, dendrochronology adds an essential longer-term perspective on climate change and variability and on the adaptation of agroforestry landscapes and forest ecosystems. Tree-ring analyses were conducted as part of three independently established international research collaborations with different partner institutes in Germany and Africa. Stable carbon and oxygen isotopes in tree rings of Sclerocarya birrea from the Sahel region (Burkina Faso) showed strong climatic signals. Tree-ring chronologies spanning more than 100 years are under development for Burkina Faso and Tanzania. The ongoing project in Munessa Forest, Ethiopia may result in chronologies of more than 350 years. Finally, the tree-ring series developed in the three projects will be combined to establish large-scale correlation patterns between tree growth and sea-surface temperatures in order to explore continent-wide climate teleconnections. In order to have representative data sets and draw continent-wide recommendations, however, there is a need to extend the study to other parts of Africa.Article taken from the <a href="http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Selected-publications/CTA-FARA-publication-Agricultural-Innovations-for-Sustainable-Development-Volume-3-Issue-2-2011" target="_blank">2011 CTA/FARA publication ‘Agricultural Innovations for Sustainable Development’ Volume 3, Issue 2</a>.</p>

					<p>This <a href="http://www.asareca.org/resources/reports/Impactsofanimprovedseedpolicyenvironment.pdf  " target="_blank">discussion paper</a> assesses the impacts of an improved seed policy environment in the Eastern and Central Africa (ECA) region using a case study of formal trade in seed maize in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania that employs a spatial equilibrium model (SEM). The paper commences by reviewing the progress made in the harmonization of seed policies in ECA region with regard to five thematic areas agreed for harmonization namely: (i) facilitation, building and empowering of public-private partnerships; (ii) observation of the importance and differences amongst technical, political and legislative stages in the process of reform; (iii) dialogue at two levels: national and regional; (iv) nurturing transparency, institutional cooperation and multi-disciplinarity; (v) differentiation between administrative/procedural and legislative issues in discussions and consensus building. The results of the welfare analysis give compelling evidence in support of an improved seed policy environment. While improved policy environment requires in contributions from many players and actors, it is assumed that harmonization of policies, laws and regulations is a critical addition to this process.</p>

					<p><b>(First prize, ‘Women in Science’ competition)</b>Efforts to improve livestock feeding in Uganda have had great strides in identifying nutritious feed resources for cattle. These include pasture grasses and legumes, leguminous shrubs and multipurpose trees, crop residues and agro-industrial by-products. Despite knowledge and the use of appropriate feed resources, milk production of dairy farms has remained low (2 to 5 L per cow per day). The poor performance indicates a gap in dissemination of knowledge to farmers. One major gap identified was that farmers did not know the quantities of feed that would adequately meet the nutritional requirements of their animals. This study demonstrates the use of decision-support tools (DST) in meeting such challenges. It provides information on low status of dairy cattle feeding. In conclusion, the DST that was developed and tested led to improved cattle feeding and increased milk production by 24%. The tool is available on the website of the Uganda National Agricultural Research Organisation (NARO-Uganda), and is recommended for use by farmers, researchers, trainers and policy-makers.Article taken from the <a href="http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Selected-publications/CTA-FARA-publication-Agricultural-Innovations-for-Sustainable-Development-Volume-3-Issue-2-2011" target="_blank">2011 CTA/FARA publication ‘Agricultural Innovations for Sustainable Development’ Volume 3, Issue 2</a>.</p>

					<p><i>K. Fuglie, et al. USDA Economic Research Report No. 147. 12/2011.</i>Meeting growing global demand for food, fibre and biofuel requires robust investment in agricultural research and development (R&amp;D) from both public and private sectors. This <a href="http://purl.umn.edu/120324 " target="_blank">study</a> examines global R&amp;D spending by private industry in seven agricultural input sectors, food manufacturing, and biofuel and describes the changing structure of these industries. In 2007 (the latest year for which comprehensive estimates are available), the private sector spent $19.7 billion on food and agricultural research (56 percent in food manufacturing and 44 percent in agricultural input sectors) and accounted for about half of total public and private spending on food and agricultural R&amp;D in high-income countries. In R&amp;D related to biofuel, annual private-sector investments are estimated to have reached $1.47 billion worldwide by 2009. Incentives to invest in R&amp;D are influenced by market structure and other factors. Agricultural input industries have undergone significant structural change over the past two decades, with industry concentration on the rise. A relatively small number of large, multinational firms with global R&amp;D and marketing networks account for most R&amp;D in each input industry. Rising market concentration has not generally been associated with increased R&amp;D investment as a percentage of industry sales.</p>

					<p><i>University of California, Berkeley, Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, CUDARE Working Papers No. 1119.</i>This <a href="http://purl.umn.edu/120415" target="_blank">paper</a> provides an overview of the environmental, economical, and policy considerations related to biofuels. While the biofuel production and consumption exhibited significant increase over the first decade of the new millennium, this and further increases in biofuel production are driven primarily by government policies. Currently available first generation biofuels are with a few exceptions not economically viable in the absence of fiscal incentives or high oil prices. Also the environmental impacts of biofuels as an alternative to fossil fuels are quite ambiguous. The review of the most recent economic models dealing with biofuels and their economic impacts provides a distinction between structural and reduced form models. The review of reduced models is structured toward the time series analysis approach to the dependencies between prices of feedstock, biofuels, and fossil fuels.</p>

					<p><b>(Keynote paper, finals of the ‘Women in Science’ competition)</b>Horticultural biodiversity which was once an integral part of African diets should have been part of the celebrations of the 2010 International Year of Biodiversity. However, with the introduction of exotic temperate crops, indigenous green vegetables lost popularity in Africa and are regarded mostly as ‘weeds’ or ‘poor man’s food’. With over 50% of the African population living below the poverty line, resulting in malnutrition and poor health, there is need for a paradigm shift in food production patterns to harness the nutrition and economic potential of indigenous vegetables and fruits. Agrobiodiversity has a crucial part to play in revolutionalising the horticultural sector for food security, nutrition, income and sustainable development in Africa. This article outlines strategies and recommendations that could be used to raise the status of agrobiodiversity in the continent.Article taken from the <a href="http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Selected-publications/CTA-FARA-publication-Agricultural-Innovations-for-Sustainable-Development-Volume-3-Issue-2-2011" target="_blank">2011 CTA/FARA publication ‘Agricultural Innovations for Sustainable Development’ Volume 3, Issue 2</a>.</p>

					<p>The Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) has released an e-book analysing the vulnerability of Pacific fisheries to climate change which includes contributions from 88 international scientists and fisheries specialists. The book was launched on the sidelines of the seventh Conference of the Pacific Community, which convened from 7 – 8 November 2011, in Noumea, New Caledonia. It predicts that ocean acidification and loss of important habitats, such as coral reefs, seagrass beds, mangroves and intertidal flats, will dramatically decrease the fish and shellfish that support many coastal communities. Communities are instead predicted to become more reliant on rich tuna resources. Freshwater fisheries are predicted to be 'winners' with the book outlining expected improvements in freshwater pond aquaculture. However, the publication notes that improved aquaculture will not be able to feed the rapidly increasing population.</p>

					<p>Women continue to be underrepresented and underserved, and their contributions remain mostly untapped in national and international agricultural research. Even within the agricultural research community, most scientists and extension agents are male. This publication, argues that the paradigm for agricultural and food security development needs to move beyond a focus on production and toward a broader view of agricultural and food systems, one that recognizes women’s distinct role in ensuring the food security of their households. Incorporating gender issues into agricultural research and paying attention to gender sensitivity when developing extension systems is necessary to meet the needs and preferences of men and women, satisfy the food needs of future populations, and improve the welfare of the poor.<a href="http://www.ifpri.org/publication/engendering-agricultural-research-development-and-extension" target="_self">http://www.ifpri.org/publication/engendering-agricultural-research-development-and-extension</a> </p>

					<p>In Uganda, agricultural extension has been hotly debated since the implementation of the National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS) program in 2001. Due to methodological challenges arising from the complex ways that many factors influence the relationship between extension inputs and outcomes, as well as data-quality issues, the effectiveness of agricultural extension in raising agricultural productivity and incomes and reducing poverty is often viewed with scepticism among policymakers and development practitioners. This study rigorously assesses the outcomes and impacts obtained thus far, in order to help offer lessons for implementing or planning demand-driven agricultural advisory services in developing countries. The findings presented here are useful to policymakers of central and local governments, farmer groups, advisory service providers, donors, and others seeking to improve agricultural extension services in Uganda and elsewhere.<a href="http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/rr175.pdf" target="_self">http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/rr175.pdf</a> </p>

					<p>Fundamental components of RUFORUM’s strategic and operational plans are to develop competitive high quality regional MSc and PhD programmes for Eastern, Central and Southern Africa. A RUFORUM workshop on Quality Assurance raised the following issues (1) The new RUFORUM supported PhD programmes need to be developed using knowledge from other experienced systems, and (2) The RUFORUM regional PhD and MSc programmes are hosted by universities with different quality assurance systems at various levels of sophistication. The programmes are now being implemented, drawing resources from regional and global centres of knowledge through partnerships brokered and maintained by RUFORUM. Programme implementation requires a quality assurance mechanism that fosters high standards within the spirit of learning and co-sharing of knowledge.

					<p><i>C. Juma et al. Discussion Paper 2011-09, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School. 2011.</i>The challenge of feeding the world’s population is an old one – but with the anticipated population growth, the world’s farmers are hard‐pressed to find a quick solution. Today, in our increasingly connected world, international and domestic policies must complement each other to help ensure food security and smooth international trade, as well as ensure farmer access to innovative technologies and to markets. Meeting this challenge will be no small task. The purpose of this volume is to explore some of the potential solutions to address this important challenge. This paper's overall conclusion is that genetically modified crops can and should play a critical role in agricultural productivity. It offers a roadmap for those interested in objectively evaluating both the risk and benefits of biotechnology in agriculture.<a href="http://farastaff.blogspot.com/2012/01/feeding-next-generation-science.html" target="_self">http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/FEEDING%20THE%20NEXT%20GENERATION_FINAL%20December%202011.pdf</a></p>

					<p><i>CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS). Working Paper no. 12. 2011.</i>The analogues approach connects sites with statistically similar (‘analogous’) climates, across space (i.e. between locations) and/or time (i.e. with past or future climates). A CCAFS dissimilarity index or Hallegatte index can be used to systematically identify climate analogues across the world, for certain regions, or among specific locations. Users may use default criteria or choose from a variety of global climate models (GCMs), scenarios, and input data. Once analogue sites are identified, information gathered from local field studies or databases can be used and compared to provide data for further studies, propose high-potential adaptation pathways, facilitate farmer-to-farmer exchange of knowledge, validate computational models, test new technologies and/or techniques, or enable us to learn from history. Users may manipulate the tool in the free, open-source R software, or access a simplified user-friendly version online.<a href="http://ccafs.cgiar.org/sites/default/files/assets/docs/ccafs-wp-12-climate-analogues-web.pdf" target="_self">http://ccafs.cgiar.org/sites/default/files/assets/docs/ccafs-wp-12-climate-analogues-web.pdf</a></p>

					<p><i>Lemma, T., et al. Improving Productivity and Market of Ethiopian Farmers (IPMS) Working Paper 29. 2012.</i>Graduate Programs in agriculture and allied disciplines in Ethiopia are expected to make concrete contributions towards achieving market-led and knowledge-based transformation of smallholder agriculture. Hence, strengthening capacities of graduate programmes and attracting policy attention is crucial. This paper discusses key challenges of the graduate programmes to realize their mandates and to meet ever changing expectations. It also presents a case study linking graduate programmes through research by students to commodity value chain development and actors, and discusses qualitative and quantitative indicators of outcome in terms of enhanced research and learning experience. The paper draws out some lessons and identifies strategic and practical options that may help to improve learning and research in the graduate programmes.<a href="http://mahider.ilri.org/handle/10568/16385" target="_self">http://mahider.ilri.org/handle/10568/16385</a> </p>

					<p><i>D. Vivas-Eugui. International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development, Issue Paper 34. 2012.</i>Biodiversity-rich countries and traditional knowledge (TK) holders have become concerned about the presumed lack of respect for national access and benefit-sharing (ABS) legislation and the misappropriation of their genetic patrimony and TK by some intellectual property (IP) applicants. More than a decade after its creation, the world Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)’s Intergovernmental Committee (IGC) has an opportunity to contribute towards providing meaningful responses to concerns relating to biodiversity and IP. A binding instrument is the surest way to see biodiversity-related measures in the IP system implemented by user countries taking into consideration that the solutions it provides will have an effect in practice. This paper makes recommendations regarding processes, substance and existing research gaps that could contribute towards advancing the IGC’s deliberations.
