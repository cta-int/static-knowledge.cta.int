						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

By C. Seré, A. Ayantunde, A. Duncan, A. Freeman, M. Herrero, S. Tarawali and I. Wright, International Livestock Research Institute, June 2008Rangelands are the largest land use system on earth. They constitute some 35 million km2 of the earth’s surface, with the majority in developing countries and some 65% (almost 22 million km2) of this in tropical Africa. Over 180 million people in the developing world depend for their livelihoods on these systems, with just over half of them living on less than $2 per day and a quarter on less than $1 per day (Thornton et al., 2002). Rangelands predominate in dryland areas where they may be defined as regions where there are less than 20 persons/km2 and where the length of the growing period (LGP) is less than 60 days/annum and does not permit significant crop growth. Figure 1 shows the location of the arid and semi-arid rangeland systems in tropical and subtropical regions of the World.</p>

By Willer, Yussefi-Menzler and Sorensen (eds), Earthscan, 2008Few people will need convincing that organic agriculture is developing rapidly, but here is the statistical proof. Worldwide, over 30 million hectares - some 700,000 farms - are now managed organically and the figure continues to rise year-on-year. Significant gains have been made in the developing world, with organic techniques improving productivity and helping address the problems of food security and climate change in Africa. This 8th annual edition gives a concise, up-to-date overview of how the industry is growing on a global scale, with detailed studies of aquaculture, new standards and regulations, notable achievements, and the challenges ahead. Not only packed with facts and figures, it includes expert insights into the latest issues, from the adoption of the new East African Organic Products Standard to the state of organics in Iran. More general coverage includes information on crop production worldwide.</p>

					<p>
By Johnnie W. F. Muwanga-Zake, Science in Africa
Why is there a need to improve and encourage science in South Africa? A greater number of science graduates results in a more skilled and therefore a more productive work force, which in turn contributes to an internationally more competitive nation and to redressing the balance of trade problems (Robottom &amp; Hart (1993: 591). This belief is reiterated frequently, for example in the South African White Paper on science and technology (1996: 10), which states that science is considered to be among the requirements for creating wealth, and improving the quality of life. Realising the importance of science to development, Africa has, according to Ogunniyi (1996: 268), been eager to develop its scientific human power to attain a measure of self-reliance in the production of goods and services, by expanding its educational facilities, and setting up curriculum development and research centres, as well as developing policies on science education.</p>

					<p>
By Bernadette P. Resurreccion and Rebecca Elmhirst (eds.), International Development Research Centre, 2008
The impetus for this book came from a growing sense of unease about the 'discursive landslide' of gender mainstreaming in natural resource management, which seemed to be at odds with our own research encounters and our engagement with emerging theoretical debates about gender in the social sciences more broadly. We observed a number of problematic and yet stubborn conceptual antecedents that continue to characterize the growing 'feminization' of natural resource management interventions. Our aim with this book is thus to initiate a response to recent calls to re-establish more politicized approaches to gender at the heart of environment–development debates. We accomplish this through exploration of the uneasy negotiations between theory, policy and practice that are evident within the realm of gender, environment and natural resource management across a range of contexts marked by hybridized neo-liberal and populist agendas of decentralization, community-based natural resource management and participation.</p>

Grain, July 2008The July issue of Seedling focuses on the food crisis. One of the few benefits of the current food crisis is that it is focusing attention on the way food reaches some of the most disadvantaged people in the world. For the poor in countries such as Haiti, Eritrea and Burundi, which are heavily dependent on food imports, this is having a catastrophic impact. But for multinational food traders it is a chance to clock up extraordinary profits. It is a graphic illustration of the huge – and increasing – disparity of wealth in the modern world. Such moments of crisis offer a chance for change. It is for this reason that a fierce battle is currently being fought. On the one hand, multinational biotechnology corporations, with the support of the US government, are taking advantage of the crisis to launch a huge offensive to promote hybrids and genetically modified organisms (GMOs). On the other hand, organisations of small-scale farmers, fisherfolk and indigenous people are saying that the current crisis has shown how dangerous it is for countries to allow multinational corporations and speculators to take control of their food supply. The way forward, they say, is sustainable food systems, based on indigenous knowledge and controlled by local farmers.</p>

By Alyson Brody, Justina Demetriades and Emily Esplen, BRIDGE, Institute of Development Studies (IDS), UK, June 2008The issue of climate change is not new, but its take-up as a key development concern and its integration into pro-poor planning is a fairly recent departure. Even more recent is the integration of a gender-sensitive perspective in climate change research and responses. For this reason, there is little existing research considering the linkages between climate change and gender. Similarly, while there is a wealth of literature on gender and the environment, gender and energy, gender and water, gender and conflict and gender and disasters, there are few explicit references to gender and climate change. This paper, prepared for the UK Department for International Development’s (DFID) Equity and Rights Team, seeks to make the most of the available resources, pulling from them useful insights that could inform and strengthen future research on and interventions into gender and climate change.</p>

					<p>
By Joachim von Braun, International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), Washington D.C, 12 June 2008
World agriculture is at a turning point: economic growth, energy needs, and climate change redefine the equations of agricultural supply and demand and contribute to accelerate food prices. Biofuels have been particularly high on the global agenda largely due to rising concerns about national energy security, high energy prices, and global climate change, as well as the income expectations of farmers and other investors (von Braun and Pachauri 2006). The rapid expansion of ethanol and biodiesel has increased dependency on natural vegetationand crops grown specifically for energy. Biofuel production has also introduced new foodsecurity risks and new challenges for the poor, particularly when resource constraints have lead to trade-offs between food and biofuel production and rising food prices. For the further development and use of biofuels, it is necessary to carefully assess the impact of different technologies, products (ethanol, bio-diesel, bio-gas), and feed stocks (e.g. sugar cane, corn, oilseeds, palm oil, agricultural waste and biomass).</p>

					<p>
By Davis, Kristin; Ekboir, Javier; Spielman, David J. (2008) Journal of Agricultural Education and Extension 14(1): 35-51.This paper examines how post-secondary agricultural education and training (AET) in sub-Saharan Africa can contribute to agricultural development by strengthening the capacity to innovate—to introduce new products and processes that are socially or economically relevant to smallholder farmers and other agents. Using the AET system in Mozambique as a case study, this paper examines the role of AET within the context of an agricultural innovation system. The paper emphasizes the importance of improving AET systems by strengthening the capabilities of organizations and professionals; changing organizational cultures, behaviors, and incentives; and building innovation networks and linkages. The paper offers several recommendations to enhance the effectiveness of AET for agricultural innovation and development. Key reforms include aligning the mandates of AET organizations with national development aspirations; inducing change in the cultures of AET organizations through the introduction of educational programs and linkages beyond the AET system; and enhancing innovative individual and organizational capacity by improving incentives to forge stronger links between AET and other stakeholders. </p>

					<p>
By Robert Paarlberg, Harvard University Press, 2008Nearly two-thirds of Africans are employed in agriculture, yet on a per-capita basis they produce roughly 20 percent less than they did in 1970. Although modern agricultural science was the key to reducing rural poverty in Asia, modern farm science—including biotechnology—has recently been kept out of Africa. In Starved for Science Robert Paarlberg explains why poor African farmers are denied access to productive technologies, particularly genetically engineered seeds with improved resistance to insects and drought. He traces this obstacle to the current opposition to farm science in prosperous countries. Having embraced agricultural science to become well-fed themselves, those in wealthy countries are now instructing Africans—on the most dubious grounds—not to do the same.</p>

					<p>
By Mariechel J. Navarro with Contributions from the Biotechnology Information Centers, ISAAA, 2008Crop biotechnology, one of the many possible scientific options to improve agricultural productivity, has delivered significant socio-economic and welfare benefits to farmers. It is the use of advanced scientific approaches to produce crops that may have any or a combination of the following traits: increased yield, pest and disease resistance, abiotic stress tolerance, enriched nutrient content, and other quality traits. Concerns related to crop biotechnology must be balanced with adequate science-based, authoritative information to enable various stakeholders to engage in an objective and transparent debate. Mutual understanding and dialogue will enable the global community to understand the attributes of crop biotechnology and help farmers and consumers to realize its potential benefits.</p>

					<p>
By Wilhemina Quaye, African Journal of Agricultural Research Vol. 3 (5): 334-342, May 2008This paper looks at the food security situation in three most deprived and poverty-stricken regions in the Northern parts of Ghana and examines how farmer households cope during food insecure periods. The study concludes that although farmers in these regions cultivate purposely for household consumption and sell the surplus, food was not available throughout the year in the farmer households interviewed. On the average staple foods produced lasted for seven months. Coping mechanisms during months of inadequate household food provision included migration to southern Ghana for wage labor, support from relatives and friends outside the regions, sales from livestock and household valuables as well as reduction of food intake and consumption of less preferred food. Erratic rainfall patterns, high cost of agrochemicals, lack of knowledge on improved farming and post harvest practices as well as lack of production credit and markets for farm produce were some of the constraints militating against increased production and improvement in food security. Measures to remove these constraints will therefore go a long way to improve the household food security situation in Northern Ghana.</p>

The purpose of this Assessment, undertaken by UNU-IAS from 2004 - 2007, was to provide a neutral, independent and objective assessment of the various internationally funded training programmes for biosafety and biotechnology, especially to the extent that it is necessary for biosafety, in the developing world. This Assessment does not advocate the use, or avoidance, of modern biotechnology. Rather it seeks to examine whether capacity building activities are delivering to developing countries the capacity to make and implement choices about biosafety and biotechnology.The Assessment sought to make broad observations about what the overall levels of existing capacity in the developing world mean for the direction of biotechnology and the international biosafety system, as much as to examine detailed questions about the challenges and successes of capacity building implementation.</p>

An evaluation of Dutch-funded research programmes in developing countries raises questions about the concept of local &quot;ownership&quot;. It highlights several projects where having potential users of research results in the driving seat undoubtedly had a beneficial effect. Projects in Bolivia, South Africa and Tanzania, for example, proved to be highly successful, notably because they included a strong focus on research capacity building. But the evaluation also identifies cases where projects failed. Understanding the reasons for this failure provides important indicators to the components of success.</p>

					<p> Andy Hall, 2007. A typology of restrictive/supportive attitudes and practices affecting (pro-poor) innovation processes and relationships in agricultural research projects is presented. In recent years, there has been an increasing recognition of the potential of the innovation systems concept to provide new ways of making more effective use of agricultural research and improve its impact on socially desirable outcomes. This paper documents the experiences of a group of researchers in India who experimented with this framework and tried to operationalise its principles in project design. The paper comments on some of the implications of using this approach and the challenges it presents for implementers of agricultural research projects in developing countries.</p>

					<p> 
Julio A. Berdegué, 2005A pro-poor innovation system is a multi-stakeholder social learning process, that generates and puts to use new knowledge and which expands the capabilities and opportunities of the poor. The innovation systems framework is outlined, focusing on rural development work. Important trends and changes in rural innovation systems are discussed, from the perspective of rural poverty reduction and agricultural development. Opportunities for pro-poor innovation are highlighted, based on a framework that takes into consideration the heterogeneity of rural poverty. </p>

					<p> Mark E. Halsey, 2007. A country that is setting out to explore the benefits of modern agricultural biotechnology for national development must be prepared to do so in a safe, systematic and transparent manner. In a Confined Field Trial (CFT), researchers are able to safely evaluate genetically engineered plants in the natural environment by following simple procedures of biological confinement and good management practices. Planning for biosafety procedures in the conduct of a CFT requires a comprehensive approach that foresees all the individual steps required to perform a field trial, from initial planning through trial conduct and oversight, post-harvest management, and final reporting.</p>

					<p> Ann Waters-Bayer, Chesha Wettasinha &amp; Laurens van Veldhuizen, 2007. The international programme PROLINNOVA seeks to build partnerships among major stakeholders in agricultural research and development to enhance processes of farmer-led participatory innovation. It starts with identifying innovations developed by farmers in order to give recognition to their creativity and to serve as entry points to genuine partnership in local-level research and development. The stakeholders involved in participatory innovation development (PID) reflect on how this differs from the way they conventionally work. They consider whether and how it leads to better results, above all, to strengthening the capacity of farmers and other actors to continue to innovate and adapt to changing conditions. They identify what institutional and policy changes are needed to enhance PID. Based on their joint analysis and on-the-ground PID experiences, they engage in policy dialogue to bring about these changes. This paper describes the origins of the PROLINNOVA initiative and the concepts behind it, the structure of partnerships at different levels - field, national and international - to promote local innovation, and the experiences made in establishing them. Particular attention is given to the role of NGOs in facilitating these multistakeholder partnerships. The numerous challenges faced and PROLINNOVA partners’ attempts to address them are a source of mutual learning.</p>
