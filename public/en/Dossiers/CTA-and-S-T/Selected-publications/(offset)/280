						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Is cassava the crop of the future for food and nutrition security and industrial development? Not unless, we increase investments in science, technology and innovation. An interesting presentation on the Global Cassava Partnership for the 21st century (GCP 21) by Dr Claude Fauquet at CTA Headquarters on 28 March 2013 triggered further reflection on the need for a coordinated approach to cassava development.
  Dr Fauquet indicated that 105 countries produce cassava; 50% of which are in Africa where surface area is almost double that of Asia and Latin America. However, yield is lower (10t/ha) as compared to 12t/ha and 19t/ha in Latin America and Asia, respectively. What is the role of African universities and research organisations in driving the research and development agenda for cassava on the continent? Which organisations are studying future consumer and industry trends for cassava?
  Which are leading programmes on: (i) documenting and characterising cassava landraces, farmer knowledge and practices; (ii) the performance of various varieties and landraces under changing climatic conditions including for drought and pest resistance; (iii) new product development for food and other industrial uses; (iv) increasing yield potential; (v) standardising height of plants (dwarf varieties) and size of roots to support industry expansion for food products, starch or animal feed etc.?
  Work is going on at some leading international centres and in collaboration with national R&amp;D organisations to produce virus-free varieties through genetic engineering and on rapid multiplication but while these are critical research areas, the success of a cassava ‘green revolution’ in Africa or world-wide requires interlinked thinking, an innovation systems approach, foresight, investments in science and engineering, an enabling policy and institutional framework and visionary leadership from scientists/academicians, policy/governments and the private sector including farmers.</p>

					<p>This book from the Centre for Development and Environment (CDE, University of Bern) details the use of geoprocessing tools to support rural extension and development. The main tools discussed are the Global Positioning System (GPS), virtual globes, and simple geographic information systems (GIS). Based on examples, the book offers a range of insights into the use of geoprocessing tools in interventions in the context of international development cooperation. Agricultural extensionists and rural advisors who have little or no experience with mapping tools are encouraged to begin using such tools in their work with communities, whenever appropriate, to add value to their initiatives and projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sdc-foodsecurity.ch/en/Home/News_in_A_RD/News_Detail?itemID=10258" target="_blank">http://www.sdc-foodsecurity.ch/en/Home/News_in_A_RD/News_Detail?itemID=10258</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(University of Bern CDE, 2012)&nbsp;</p>

					<p>This paper calls for upgrading the training, extension, and commercialisation functions of existing national agricultural research institutes (NARIs). This would build on a strong research tradition, ongoing training efforts, connections with the private sector and farmers, and extensive international partnerships. Upgrading NARIs in this manner would also lay the foundation for the emergence of the first generation of research universities in Africa with an initial focus on agriculture. The creation of agricultural innovation universities would serve as a starting point for broader efforts in Africa to strengthen the role of science, technology, and innovation in economic transformation. The paper provides a roadmap that can be used to guide the proposed reform efforts.&nbsp;<a href="http://web.hks.harvard.edu/publications/workingpapers/citation.aspx?PubId=8428" target="_blank">http://web.hks.harvard.edu/publications/workingpapers/citation.aspx?PubId=8428</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Harvard Kennedy School, 06/2012)&nbsp;</p>

Three policy areas determine the benefit from agroforestry: 1) Long term private property rights; 2) Policies related to tree germplasm multiplication and dissemination; 3) Recognition of agroforestry as an attractive investment area within agricultural programmes. Policy-related constraints include: land and tree tenure, germplasm systems, subsidies for other land use practices, extension systems, departmental structure of governments, and recognition of environmental services. Policy reforms that have been pro-agroforestry did tackle some of these issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://agroforestry.net/overstory/overstory251.html" target="_blank">http://agroforestry.net/overstory/overstory251.html</a> &nbsp;(<i>The Overstory</i> No. 251, January 2013)</p>

					<p>This report, prepared for the EC Joint Research Centre (JRC), presents the final results of the study named AVEMAC (Assessing Agriculture Vulnerabilities for the design of Effective Measures for Adaptation to Climate Change). The study tackles the lack of information on vulnerabilities, risks, and needs for the adaptation of European priority crops (maize, wheat, rapeseed, sunflower, rice) under a changing climate. Assessing the importance of climate change vulnerability requires not only the localisation of relative yield changes, but also the analysis of the impact of the change on the acreage affected. The assessment has shown contrasting results in response to the different realisations of the emission scenarios.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/analysis/external/avemac/index_en.htm" target="_blank">http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/analysis/external/avemac/index_en.htm</a> &nbsp;(EC JRC, 04/2012)&nbsp;</p>

					<p>This report by the Fridtjof Nansen Institute (FNI, Norway) presents the EU legislation on the marketing of seed and plant propagating material, detailing how it affects agricultural biodiversity. It discusses the principles of the EU’s twelve basic directives in this area and the three directives providing derogations for the purpose of conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture.

					<p>This synthesis paper by university researchers from Norway and Denmark is an analysis of how resilience theory can be applied to agroecosystems. Building on the premise that agroecosystems are too complex for resilience to be measured in any precise manner, the authors have delineated behaviour-based indicators of resilience within agroecosystems. They discuss an index of 13 such indicators, which, when identified in an agroecosystem, suggest that it is resilient and endowed with the capacity for adaptation and transformation (examples of such indicators are connectedness, self-regulation, functional diversity, spatiotemporal heterogeneity). Absence of these indicators can help identify points of intervention for stakeholders to build resilience where there is vulnerability.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seachangecop.org/node/1141" target="_blank">http://www.seachangecop.org/node/1141</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;(SEA Change CoP, 2012)&nbsp;</p>

					<p>The European Network for the Durable Exploitation of Crop Protection Strategies (ENDURE) submitted this brief for the Foresight Breakout Session of GCARD2012. It is based on <a href="http://www.endure-network.eu/about_endure/all_the_news/available_now_european_crop_protection_in_2030" target="_blank">a foresight study</a> that provided crop protection stakeholders with the tools to proactively respond to new EU legislation on pesticides. The study posed questions on how to reconcile health and environmental concerns with export-oriented agriculture, food production for food self-sufficiency, energy-saving farming, or multi-functional agriculture. It shows that many of the driving forces impacting crop protection are outside and beyond the sphere of influence of the crop protection world itself. These regard macro-economic choices affecting the role of European agriculture on the world market or the place that Europe wishes to give to local development. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.endure-network.eu/content/download/6653/48461/file/Marco%20Barzman_Brief%2005_Final.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.endure-network.eu/content/download/6653/48461/file/Marco%20Barzman_Brief%2005_Final.pdf</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.endure-network.eu/about_endure/all_the_news/available_now_european_crop_protection_in_2030" target="_blank">http://www.endure-network.eu/about_endure/all_the_news/available_now_european_crop_protection_in_2030</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;(ENDURE, 14/12/2012)&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Although disease is a major threat to aquaculture production, the underlying global epidemiological patterns are unknown. This research analysed disease outbreak severity across different latitudes in a diverse range of aquaculture systems. It found that disease at lower latitudes progresses more rapidly and results in higher cumulative mortality, in particular at early stages of development and in shellfish. Tropical countries suffer proportionally greater losses in aquaculture during disease outbreaks and have less time to mitigate losses. The authors believe that as the incidences of some infectious diseases may increase with climate change, adaptation strategies must consider global patterns in disease vulnerability of aquaculture. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.une.edu.au/staff/tleung/2012-leung-bates-more-rapid-and-severe-disease.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.une.edu.au/staff/tleung/2012-leung-bates-more-rapid-and-severe-disease.pdf</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Journal of Applied Ecology</i>, 5/12/2012)</p>

					<p>Conventional wisdom among policymakers and development agencies is that smallholders must be integrated into modern markets and organised within value chains in order for them to increase their income. Thus the focus of national and regional agricultural policies is on helping farmers to meet the quality and quantity requirements of supermarkets, processors and export firms. Research and experience from work by IIED, Hivos, and partners, documented here suggests that this focus ignores the majority of small-scale farmers who are not organised in value chains or producing for supermarket or export, and who supply the majority of consumers (many still buy their food from traditional markets and small retailers). The paper describes how and where small-scale farmers are trading, how their markets work and how these markets can help improve mechanisms that support the flexibility of informality.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://pubs.iied.org/16520IIED.html" target="_blank">http://pubs.iied.org/16520IIED.html</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(IIED, 11/2012)</p>

					<p>This report tells the story of an agreement on access to teff genetic resources in Ethiopia, and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from their use, that was hailed as one of the most advanced of its time. The agreement was seen as a pilot case for the implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in terms of access and benefit sharing. The implementation of the agreement failed and as a result, Ethiopia was left with fewer possibilities for generating and sharing the benefits from the use of teff genetic resources.

					<p>At the global level, two thirds of the 774&nbsp;million illiterate adults are women, and this&nbsp;percentage has not improved over the past&nbsp;two decades. This is prompting some&nbsp;serious reflection and prospective thinking.&nbsp;Robert Zoellick, for example, former&nbsp;president of the World Bank, once said that&nbsp;investing in girls is not just a good thing&nbsp;but a smart thing to do. MDG Goal 3, which&nbsp;emphasizes gender equality, is most likely&nbsp;to be missed but remains a laudable&nbsp;objective. It is increasingly recognized that&nbsp;eliminating the gender gap can boost GDP&nbsp;in the United States, the Eurozone and&nbsp;Japan by 9%, 13% and 16%, respectively. In&nbsp;the BRICS, and other fast-growing&nbsp;developing countries, including Mauritius,&nbsp;the gap is already narrowing.&nbsp;</p>

For example, a Dutch policy think&nbsp;tank, noted that while the Netherlands&nbsp;ranked 8th in the Global Competitiveness&nbsp;Index, the Dutch innovation system faced&nbsp;several challenges that needed to be&nbsp;addressed by policy.It recommended: (i)&nbsp;increasing ‘the levels of output and quality&nbsp;in higher education, a more ambitious&nbsp;learning culture and a research climate that&nbsp;fosters excellence’; (ii) strengthening ‘the&nbsp;innovative capacity of Dutch (small and&nbsp;medium-sized) companies and improving&nbsp;the relationships between the public&nbsp;knowledge institutes and the private sector&nbsp;(especially SMEs)’ and; (iii) creating ‘a more&nbsp;attractive business and investment climate&nbsp;and more room for entrepreneurial&nbsp;activities’.</p>

					<p>Devra Jarvis of Bioversity International and colleagues, reviews and discusses how studies on (i) on-farm diversity assessment; (ii) access to diversity and information; (iii) extent of use of available materials and information; and (iv) benefits obtained by the farmer or farming community from their use of local crop diversity, are necessary to identify the different ways of supporting farmers and farming communities in the maintenance of traditional varieties and crop genetic diversity within their production systems. Throughout this paper, two key themes are emphasized. First, any description or analysis within the four main areas (assessment, access, use and benefit) can, and most probably will, lead to a number of different actions. Second, the decision to implement a particular action, and therefore its success, will depend on farmers and the farming community having the knowledge and leadership capacity to evaluate the benefits that this action will have for them. This in turn emphasizes the importance of activities (whether by local, national and international organisations and agencies) of strengthening local institutions so as to enable farmers to take a greater role in the management of their resources.(<a href="http://www.bioversityinternational.org/index.php?id=7038" target="_blank">Bioversity International</a>, 10/12/2012)</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415537865/" target="_blank">This book</a> by William Critchley (VU University Amsterdam, the Netherlands) and John Gowing (Newcastle University, UK), published November 2012, reviews the state of the art of water harvesting for crop production and other uses in Sub-Saharan Africa. It defines water harvesting as a set of approaches which occupy an intermediate position along the water-management spectrum extending from in situ moisture conservation to irrigated agriculture. It includes an assessment of water harvesting schemes that were initiated two or three decades ago when interest was stimulated by the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s. These events provide lessons to promote sustainable development of dryland agriculture in the face of changing environmental conditions. Case studies from eight countries across Sub-Saharan Africa provide the evidence base, with a focus on attempts to promote adoption of water harvesting, both horizontally (spread) and vertically (institutionalization).</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.cirad.fr/en/research-operations/research-results/2012/what-is-the-role-of-conservation-agriculture-on-family-farms-in-the-south" target="_blank">This meta-study</a> conducted by scientists from CIRAD (France) and partner institutions in Brazil, presents the advantages and limitations of conservation agriculture (CA). It shows that while CA is a viable option to achieve sustainable and intensive crop production, its success mostly results from the permanent presence of organic mulch on the soil surface and the incorporation of cover crops in the rotations. Thus, applying CA principles requires a significant reorganisation of the production process at farm level, and when facing technical or socioeconomic constraints, most farmers usually opt for applying only partially the three main principles of conservation agriculture. The authors point to further investigations into the consequences of such partial implementation of conservation agriculture principles on its actual efficiency.(CIRAD, 09/2012)</p>

					<p>Zerihun Tadele (University of Bern, Switzerland) and Kebebew Assefa (Debre Zeit Agricultural Research Center, Ethiopia) have compiled <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/2/4/240" target="_blank">a review</a> of the major understudied (‘orphan’) crops of Africa (for example: teff, fonio, grass pea, okra, amaranth, among several other crops), listing their desirable and undesirable properties and the current knowledge (economic and scientific) on their production and improvement efforts (and the organisations working on the subject). The call for an agricultural revolution must point to further research on orphan crops of Africa if they are to benefit from modern improvement techniques to enable a truly secure agricultural sector on the continent. Partnerships, farmer participation and modern research capacity dedicated to these understudied crops may well get improved varieties out in the fields.(<i>Agronomy</i> 2012, 2(4), 240-283)</p>

					<p><a href="http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/tipping-the-balance-policies-to-shape-agricultural-investments-and-markets-in-f-254551 " target="_blank">This report</a> by Oxfam and IIED identifies key policy levers at a national level that can tip commercial investments in favour of either small- or large-scale farming. It shows how policy levers influence market governance to constrain or to support the fair sharing of risk and reward between small-scale producers and the rest of the market. This report develops a framework to examine the role of policy at three levels: at the level of agricultural policy basics (Agriculture within wider development policies; Infrastructure and institutions; Cross-cutting gender laws and policies; Voice and participation); at the level of directly shaping investments (Investment policies; Control over land and natural resources; Conditions for investor access to land and natural resources; Contract farming and supply chain relationships); and at the level of market governance (Support for producer organisations; Diversity of market outlets; Market co-ordination; Competition policy; Quotas and market preferences; Public policies for private standards; Trade policy). The report also examines policy elements that can specifically contribute to gender-equitable results. Case studies, conducted in Guatemala, Nigeria, Tanzania and the Philippines, supported the research.(Oxfam and IIED, 6/12/2012)</p>

					<p>This <a href="http://www.kva.se/Documents/Vetenskap_samhallet/Forskningspolitik/2012/akademirapport_breakthrough_research_121209.pdf" target="_blank">comparative study</a> of the research policy system of five countries, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Switzerland was commissioned by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (KVA). Worried that the international importance of Swedish research is declining, the KVA sought to understand the reasons and explore avenues to counteract the decline. Some reasons that were identified include: 1) the rapid increase in undergraduate education without adequate funding and the increasing separation of education from research; 2) the ongoing shift towards more strategic research and the increase in short-term external funding which has weakened the sector’s more challenging, investigator-driven basic research, which requires a longer-term view. The report recommended that the Swedish research universities take steps to improve conditions for research which a) give the universities more independence from government regulations and thus greater freedom; b) secure the universities’ long-term block funding for core, basic research; c) develop more efficient administration systems for operational sectors; undergraduate education, independent long-term academic research prioritized by the university, externally financed, targeted research and externally funded commercialization; d) establish internationally attractive research chairs and increase researchers’ national and international mobility and e) handle issues of intellectual property rights (IPR) more professionally.(<a href="http://www.kva.se/Documents/Vetenskap_samhallet/Forskningspolitik/2012/akademirapport_breakthrough_research_121209.pdf" target="_blank">KVA report</a> via <i><a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20121214121354858" target="_blank">University World News</a></i>, 16/12/2012)</p>
