						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>The National Science Foundation funded a synthesis study on the status, contributions, and future direction of discipline-based education research (DBER) in physics, biological sciences, geosciences, and chemistry. DBER combines knowledge of teaching and learning with deep knowledge of discipline-specific science content. It describes the discipline-specific difficulties learners face and the specialized intellectual and instructional resources that can facilitate student understanding. Discipline-Based Education Research is based on a 30-month study built on two workshops held in 2008 to explore evidence on promising practices in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. This book asks questions that are essential to advancing DBER and broadening its impact on undergraduate science teaching and learning. The book provides empirical research on undergraduate teaching and learning in the sciences, explores the extent to which this research currently influences undergraduate instruction, and identifies the intellectual and material resources required to further develop DBER.</p>

					<p>New research by the STEPS Centre, the Stockholm Resilience Centre and the Tellus Institute argues that sustainable development goals (SDGs) that keep human societies within a 'safe operating space' requires an approach to innovation that gives far greater recognition and power to grassroots actors and processes, involving them within an inclusive, multi-scale innovation politics. In this jointly-authored paper, current development goals focussing on one-track scientific solutions to global challenges are seen as failing to respond effectively to the uncertainty and shifting dynamics of today's world, and to the diverse needs of the poor. Research and experiences across the world, in areas like agriculture, water, energy and health, illustrate what the paper suggests are a set of underlying principles that need to guide innovation for sustainability and poverty reduction. Three interlinked dimensions need to be assessed together: Direction, Diversity, and Distribution.

	The strategic position of cassava in the food and farming systems of millions of rural households, especially in Africa, is highlighted. Key issues in cassava agronomy, especially regarding planting materials and productivity per unit area are discussed. The development of improved varieties as well as status and constraints in the cassava seed distribution system in Nigeria are emphasised. Also, development of the technology of rapid multiplication of improved cassava varieties is discussed with special regard to reasons for and processes of the technology’s use by farmers. A case study of the adoption and competence of use among farmers in a cassava-growing location in Southern Nigeria is reported. Essentially, the opportunities and constraints associated with the technology in the agricultural innovation processes of cassava are examined and questions raised as to its suitability for up-scaling, given the challenges in obtaining substantial quantities of roots.</p>

					<p>IFPRI’s <i>2011 Global Food Policy Report</i> – the first in a new annual series – provides an in-depth, contextualised look at the past year’s major food policy developments and events. It both raises and answers these key questions: What happened in food policy in 2011 and why? What challenges and opportunities resulted? What could have been done differently? What should be done in the future? The topics covered in the <i>2011 Global Food Policy Report</i> were selected after numerous consultations by a strategic advisory council consisting of policymakers, researchers, and other experts that sought to represent the most profound, relevant, and broadly applicable food policy issues that arose in 2011.</p>

					<p>As human populations grow and resources are depleted, agriculture will need to use land, water, and other resources more efficiently and without sacrificing long-term sustainability. ‘Darwinian Agriculture’ presents an entirely new approach to these challenges, one that draws on the principles of evolution and natural selection.R. Ford Denison, professor of ecology at the University of Minnesota, shows how both biotechnology and traditional plant breeding can use Darwinian insights to identify promising routes for crop genetic improvement and avoid costly dead ends. Denison explains why plant traits that have been genetically optimized by individual selection are bad candidates for genetic improvement. Traits like plant height and leaf angle, which determine the collective performance of plant communities, offer more room for improvement. Agriculturalists can also benefit from more sophisticated comparisons among natural communities and from the study of wild species in the landscapes where they evolved.Darwinian Agriculture reveals why it is sometimes better to slow or even reverse evolutionary trends when they are inconsistent with our present goals, and how we can glean new ideas from natural selection's marvellous innovations in wild species.(<a href="http://agro.biodiver.se/2012/04/nibbles-book-watermelon-pests-diseases-lime-juice-disinfectant-seed-laws-bibliography/" target="_self">Agro.biodiv.se</a>, 19/04/2012)</p>

					<p>This publication by the <a href="http://www.acbio.org.za/" target="_self">African Centre for Biosafety</a>, an advocacy and research group, provides a comprehensive update of the situation with genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in South Africa. Since the group’s last South African update, published in 2008, on genetically modified crops and the transnational companies that control the technology, GMOs have become more entrenched in the country’s agricultural landscape. Over three quarters of South Africa’s maize is now GM, Roundup Ready soybean cultivation has increased nearly fourfold. If Pioneer Hi-Bred’s acquisition of Pannar seed is accepted, the Centre believes that the country will relinquish all control over its seed system to two US-based multinational corporations. The Centre has recent publication documenting the country’s seed system and also its biofuels programme. (ACB; 15/5/2012)</p>

					<p>The manual, by Salvatore Ceccarelli of ICARDA describes how to organize a Participatory Plant Breeding (PPB) programme in self-pollinated, crosspollinated and vegetatively propagated crops, how to design the trials, collect, organize and analyse the data, and eventually how to use and share the information generated by a PPB programme. The overall objective is to show that Institutions responsible for plant breeding can organize their plant breeding programmes in a participatory manner and therefore in many cases the topics discussed are common to PPB and to Conventional Plant Breeding (CPB); this underlines that a PPB programme can be organized on scientific grounds as solid as those on which a CPB programme is based.

					<p>The preparation of this Interagency Report, drafted April 2012, coordinated by the FAO and the OECD, responds to Mexico’s invitation, as G20 President, to examine practical actions that could be undertaken to sustainably improve agricultural productivity growth, in particular on small family farms.The report examines current trends in productivity and its main drivers – innovation, investment and policy. It takes stock of actions underway, in particular those included in the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/jun/23/g20-agriculture-summit-main-points" target="_self">2011 G20 Ministerial Action Plan</a>. Two other sections focus on four broad areas that require attention: providing an enabling environment conducive to investment and innovation in agriculture; investing in agricultural innovation, broadly defined; improving national and international research collaboration; and, closing the gap between actual and potential productivity levels of agriculture in developing countries. The recommendations provided are broadly of two types: specific actions that can contribute in one way or another to improving productivity growth or sustainable resource use (whether building on existing initiatives or suggesting new activities) and more general proposals that may not be actionable as presented but that serve to highlight areas for priority attention.

	In Uganda as well as in many other countries, labour-saving tools have been advocated as important in increasing productivity, and improving the quality of life. Women have been specifically targeted because they are seen as central to overcoming rural poverty. Engineers have always assumed that by considering women in technology development and dissemination processes, this will guarantee use of the labour saving tools and consequently reduce time spent on agriculture related activities. However, existing processes which focus on the technology and the problem it is intended to solve, without necessarily giving women a role in their development, have little chance of succeeding. This paper demonstrates how women can be incorporated in reshaping technological solutions. The argument is made that an integrated approach that is grounded not only in engineering but also in the sociology of gender, and insights from Science and Technology Studies (STS) is needed, if labour saving tools are to be used for women’s empowerment.</p>

	Although fisheries, mainly small-scale as well as a few industrial size operations, contribute only a small percent to gross domestic product in most Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries: they are important for food security, livelihoods, culture and tourism among other economic activities. In many fisheries value chains, postharvest processing is minimal and mainly fresh chilled and frozen seafood products are supplied to domestic and premium export markets. Ecosystem and economic contexts place these value chains within the arena of governance for socio-economic development. However, social-ecological interactions within fisheries, and between fisheries and other sectors, are complex and adaptive. In this article, Patrick McConney explores the increasing convergence of value chains and governance issues which are expanded to include additional elements of institutional analysis as well as civil society and power dynamics. He argues that there needs to be a stronger connection between value chains and the governance of socio-ecological systems from a network perspective. This would clearly show that fisheries value chains are more than financial and commodity transactions as they are linked to ecosystem health and the well-being of human communities. What lessons can be learned and what are the future directions for research and development are critical questions. Drawing on examples of CARICOM fisheries value chains, one answer is that enabling fisheries policies are needed. Responses from CARICOM fisherfolk organizations are also highlighted.</p>

					<p>
The IAASTD, which ran between 2003 and 2008, involving over 400 scientists worldwide, was an ambitious attempt to encourage local and global debate on the future of agricultural science and technology. Responding to critiques of top-down, northern-dominated expert assessments of the past, the IAASTD aimed to be more inclusive and participatory in both design and process. But how far did it meet these objectives? Did it genuinely allow alternative voices to be heard? Did it create a new mode of engagement in global arenas? And what were the power relations involved, creating what processes of inclusion and exclusion? These questions are probed in an examination of the IAASTD process over five years, involving a combination of interviews with key participants and review of available documents.

					<p>The importance of addressing capacity gaps to enable Africa to achieve its 6% sustainable growth in agriculture has been widely articulated within Africa and explicitly addressed in the <a href="http://knowledge.cta.int/en/Dossiers/CTA-and-S-T/Selected-publications/CHEA-Communique-Ministerial-Conference-on-Higher-Education-in-Agriculture-in-Africa-Kampala-November-2010" target="_blank">Communique from the Ministerial Conference on Higher Education in Agriculture in Africa</a> (CHEA, Kampala, 18th November 2010). The need to invest in a radical transformation of the tertiary agricultural education (TAE) system to ensure that they can meet these needs has been highlighted in the Framework for African Agricultural Productivity (FAAP) and has resulted, through a series of workshops and discussions, in the development of TEAM-Africa – the Tertiary Education for Agriculture Mechanism in Africa.</p>
