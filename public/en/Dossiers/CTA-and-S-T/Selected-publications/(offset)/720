						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>By Pedro A. Sánchez, The Earth Institute, Columbia University, 2010. Between 1960 and 2000, Asian and Latin American food production tripled, thanks to the use of high-yielding crop varieties. Africa can follow suit, but only if the depletion of soil nutrients is addressed. Decades of farming without adequate fertilizer and manure have stripped the soils of the vital nutrients needed to support plant growth. Replenishing soil fertility, by using mineral and organic fertilizers, is therefore the primary biophysical requirement for increasing food production in tropical Africa. Many studies have shown that, once this fundamental deficiency has been addressed, the road to food security is open. The ongoing development of a high-resolution digital soil map of Africa19 will enable farmers to pinpoint exactly which forms of mineral and organic fertilizers are needed in each field, helping to replace the current blanket recommendations that are often used in tropical Africa. The digital soil map will also provide information on which leguminous trees or nitrogen-fixing crops to use.</p>

					<p>By the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), May 2010. Agricultural research and development (R&amp;D) in Sierra Leone virtually ceased in the 1990s due to the ravages of civil war. Several researchers were killed by rebels, research facilities and equipment were destroyed or severely damaged, and many research stations were abandoned as staff took refuge in Freetown. When peace was finally declared in 2002, Sierra Leone embarked on what will be a long road towards reconstructing its agricultural research infrastructure and capacity. As a result, agricultural R&amp;D spending rose rapidly.</p>

					<p>By the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), May 2010. Public agricultural research and development (R&amp;D) in Senegal has been negatively affected by contractions in funding and capacity since the mid-1980s. In 2008, the country employed 141 full-time equivalent (FTE) agricultural researchers and spent 6.5 billion CFA francs, or 25.9 million purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars on agricultural R&amp;D (both in constant 2005 prices), which is well below the levels recorded in the 1980s and 1990s. PPPs are synthetic exchange rates used to reflect the purchasing power of currencies; they typically compare prices among a broader range of goods and services than conventional exchange rates do.</p>

					<p>
By Global Donor Platform for Rural Development, April 2010. Issue Paper 9 highlights priority areas for intervention in 2010 in ongoing efforts to mainstream agriculture, food security and development in the global climate change debate. What next for agriculture? Uncertainty remains on how best to proceed to reach a new climate change agreement, and on the relevance of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The first post-Copenhagen UNFCCC meetings, held in Bonn from 9-11 April, sought agreement on how to proceed with UNFCCC negotiations in 2010. Two of the main issues in Bonn were the Copenhagen Accord’s relevance to the work of the Ad Hoc Working Groups, and whether the work of the two groups should be linked. There were differing views on both issues. Developed countries – and those having associated themselves with the Accord – wanted the Accord included in negotiations; other countries, which wanted to keep the UNFCCC at heart of negotiations, did not. Most developed countries wanted a close link between the two working groups; most developing countries preferred to keep them separate. </p>

					<p>By International Foundation for Animal Genetics, 28 October 2009. The domestication of livestock species and a long history of migrations, selection and adaptation have created an enormous variety of breeds. Conservation of these genetic resources relies on demographic characterization, the recording of production environments and effective data management. In addition, molecular genetic studies allow a comparison of genetic diversity within and across breeds, and a reconstruction of the history of breeds and ancestral populations. This has been summarized for cattle, yak, water buffalo, sheep, goats, camelids, pigs, horses, and chickens. Further progress is expected to benefit from advances in molecular technology.</p>

					<p>By American Chemical Society, 21 December 2009. Over the last few decades, there has been growing concern about antibiotic resistance (AR). The emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), resistant Clostridium difficile and multi-resistant pseudomonads, which are epidemic ‘Super Bugs’, threatens health care systems worldwide. Interestingly, resistance to antibiotic compounds in environmental microorganisms (i.e. species non-native to enteric systems) is a natural phenomenon, especially in soils; however, how the Super Bug epidemic relates to resistance in environmental species is not known. For example, although industrial production of antibiotic and antimicrobial agents has increased substantially since World War II, concurrent changes in basal AR levels in natural soil communities have not been assessed. This is relevant because the exposure of environmental organisms to antimicrobial agents, heavy metals, and resistant commensal and pathogenic species might create reservoirs of resistance traits in soil organisms, which may have broader consequences for public health. </p>

					<p>
By Stephen N. Ngigi, December 2009. Agriculture will be affected by reduced growing seasons and higher temperatures. The IPCC predicted that rainfed crop yields in some countries will decrease by 50%, and that an estimated 50–250 million Africans will face increased water stress by 2020. With only about 6% of African crop lands irrigated, the impacts on smallholders could be catastrophic.The study points out that current poor performance in terms of water-use efficiency, plus competition over diminishing water resources, suggests the need for investment in better water management systems. Also, where access to irrigation is limited, smallholder farmers need to develop water conservation and rainwater harvesting systems to maximize on-farm water management. Smallholder AWM is emphasized for a number of reasons. The performance of large public irrigation schemes in Africa is associated with poor governance and insecure land tenure, leading to low farmer investment and exploitation by government agencies. This partly explains the low cost recovery, poor performance, low water use efficiency, poor crop yields, low water productivity and weak sustainability that typify public irrigation schemes. A key policy change would be to support increased investment in smallholder irrigation as opposed to large-scale irrigation projects.</p>

					<p>By Uma Lele, Jules Pretty, Eugene Terry and Eduardo Trigo, with assistance from Maggie Klousia. This paper by the Global Authors’ Team (GAT) was commissioned by the Global Forum on International Agricultural Research (GFAR) as an input into the Global Conference on Agricultural Research for Development (GCARD). It builds on the consultations conducted over nearly a year as part of the GCARD process. Some 2000 stakeholders of agricultural research from different sectors participated in these consultations. It also draws on the team’s analysis of the state of the world agricultural research undertaken by or for the benefit of developing countries and the rapidly changing international context in which the research is conducted. The Team reviewed nearly 300 recent and historical documents, drew on their own collective experience of nearly 35 years as well as benefiting from perspectives and comments on the earlier draft from the authors of Regional Papers, leaders of international, regional and national research systems, colleagues in IFAD, FAO, GFAR, the CGIAR, the World Bank, IDS and many others. The team also reflected on the discussions during the GCARD and the paper will be finalized by the end of April 2010. Comments are welcome from all readers.

	By Savitri Mohapatra, Rice Today, April 2010. New findings presented by Africa Rice Center (AfricaRice) scientists and their partners during the Africa Rice Congress held 22nd -26th March 2010 in Bamako, Mali, have sparked renewed interest in the African rice species. A few African farmers, such as the villagers in the Danyi plateau, have continued to grow African rice because of its adaptability and its ceremonial and cultural value. These farmers inspired AfricaRice scientists to investigate the species and tap into its rich reservoir of genes for resistance to several stresses, including weeds. Studies have shown that one of the O. glaberrima varieties, CG 14, is weed competitive and has good resistance to iron toxicity, drought, nematodes, waterlogging, and major African rice diseases and pests. </p>

	By TWAS, January 2010. Advances in science depend on the open migration of scientists. While such free movements benefit both science and scientists, science-poor countries continue to be hampered by the ‘brain drain’ phenomenon. Nevertheless, countries such as China and India have begun to reap the benefits of ‘brain circulation’, as highly skilled migrants return home and diaspora networks create valuable opportunities for the development of science and the economy.</p>

UWI in consultation with its key stakeholder noted that over the years UWI had not established a strong link with other CARICOM states to solve problems affecting the agricultural sector and related industries. One of the recommendations is that UWI should be recognized by CARICOM not only as an institution involved in building human capacity but as a research, innovation and outreach institution and configure itself into a think tank to address current issues and provide pro-active policy direction for Caribbean states.</p>

					<p>Agricultural biotechnology alone will not solve the multitude of problems that farmers in Africa face; however, it has the potential to make crop breeding and crop management systems more efficient thereby generating improved crop varieties and higher yields. The challenges facing the continent on biotechnology and biosafety include lack of fund; loss of trained technical expertise; slow development of the biotechnology sector; inadequate Intellectual Property Rights infrastructure; government not taking a more active political role in promoting the technology and the issue of public acceptance brought about by activism. The lag in development of a governance capacity for biotechnology is seen in the current status of the development of national biosafety frameworks (NBFs) in Africa. </p>

This document is the result of a joint effort of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA). The main conclusions highlight the fact that the agriculture of tomorrow will require greater investments in: a) research and technologies that make more efficient use of water, and environmentally more sustainable production systems; b) restoration of agrobiodiversity, local production systems and traditional knowledge, and food products to help diversify diets; c) promotion of healthier food habits and development of production systems and products with a reduced environmental impact (e.g., in terms of water and energy requirements and generation of greenhouse gases); and d) financial and non-financial mechanisms for the management of risks related to markets and climate change.</p>

					<p>By O'Farrell, PJAnderson, PML Milton, SJ Dean, WRJ. Human adaptation and response to drought is primarily through evasion or endurance. A review of historical agricultural practices in southern Africa demonstrates evidence of drought evasion response strategies in well-established transhumance routes, where herders move livestock on a seasonal basis in order to exploit resources subject to different climatic regimes. European settlers to the arid regions of South Africa quickly recognised the necessity of these evasion options to survive drought, and adopted the transhumance practices of indigenous farmers. Areas of geographically diverse resource bases became hotly contested by settlers and indigenous farmers. The success of evasion systems are shown to hinge on good social and institutional support structures. Climate change predictions suggest an increase in drought, suggesting that the adoption of mitigating strategies should be a matter of urgency. To do this South Africa needs to build social and institutional capacity, strive for better economic and environmental sustainability, embed drought-coping mechanisms into land restitution policy to ensure the success of this programme, and acknowledge the diversity of the agricultural sector.</p>
