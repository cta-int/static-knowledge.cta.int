						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

B. Schlamadinger and I. Jürgens, FAO, 2004 This paper describes the eligibility of different types of biomass energy projects in developing countries, as a means for offsetting emissions through the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism. Specifically, the replacement of non-renewable types of biomass with renewable energy, or the improvement of the efficiency of energy systems based on non-renewable biomass, will be difficult if not impossible as CDM projects under current rules. These problems are caused by the categorical exclusion of land-use from the CDM (with the exception of afforestation and reforestation projects). The paper offers some possible solutions for both small-scale and ‘regular’ CDM projects.  </p>

					<p> 
Calestous Juma, presentation at the African Development Bank, Tunis, April 14, 2006African countries are as diverse in culture as they are differentiated in their political heritage. Most of them are historically been associated with natural resources and raw materials. Most of the economies have either stagnated or decline. A few have prospered but their lessons are not easy to extend to others. There is growing recognition, however, that Africa can only strengthen its economic performance through considerable investment and use of new knowledge. A new economic vision for the region - expressed at the highest level of government - should focus on the role of knowledge as a basis for economic transformation. Doing so will entail placing policy emphasis on emerging opportunities such as renewing infrastructure, building technical capabilities, stimulating business development, and increasing participation in the global economy. These areas should provide a firm foundation upon which to base development investments and international partnerships. </p>

The 200 participants included vice-chancellors, deans of faculties and heads of academic departments in African universities. There were also participants from among the donor community and agencies involved in higher education and in promoting S&amp;T in Africa. The participants deliberated on many issues and developed proposals for resolving the problems and strategies to make S&amp;T institutions more relevant to national development objectives. An action plan was developed for the revitalization of African Science and Technology training Institutions (ANSTI). This report of the conference gives an account of the problems affecting S&amp;T training institutions and proposes strategies and actions to overcome them. The last chapter identifies priority areas requiring regional cooperation.  </p>

Philip G. Pardey et al. (Eds), IFPRI Issue Brief No. 46, June 2006Throughout the 20th century, improvements in agricultural productivity have lifted millions from poverty and starvation and primed the pump of economic progress. These improvements have been closely linked to investments in agricultural R&amp;D. In the past quarter century, many countries have made major changes in the way they fund and organize public agricultural R&amp;D and in the incentives affecting private R&amp;D. These changes raise questions about the prospects for sustaining productivity over the next 25 years and beyond. Toward the end of the 20th century, public and private roles shifted in many countries and support for public agricultural research slowed, especially for market, applied, productivity-enhancing research. Today, a slower growing, stagnant, or shrinking public agricultural research pot is increasingly being diverted away from the traditional agenda toward environmental objectives, food quality and safety, and so on. Who, then, will do the research required to generate sustenance for a growing world population when - at least for another quarter century - virtually all the population growth will occur in the poorer parts of the world?  </p>

Philip G. Pardey et al. (Eds), IFPRI Food Policy Report No. 17, August 2006Sustained, well-targeted, and effectively used investments in R&amp;D have reaped handsome rewards from improved agricultural productivity and cheaper, higher quality foods and fibers. As we begin a new millennium, the global patterns of investments in agricultural R&amp;D are changing in ways that may have profound consequences for the structure of agriculture worldwide and the ability of poor people in poor counties to feed themselves. This report discusses these changing investment patterns, highlighting developments in the public and private sectors. Some past trends are continuing or have come into sharper focus, while others are moving in new directions. This report also illustrates the use of spatial data to analyze spillover prospects among countries or agro-ecologies and the targeting of R&amp;D to address specific production problems like drought-induced production risks.

Philip G. Pardey et al. (Eds) IFPRI, September 2006.This book was conceived as a companion to the volume Paying for Agricultural Productivity (Johns Hopkins University Press/ IFPRI, 1999), which dealt with investments, institutions, and policy processes regarding agricultural R&amp;D in developed countries. This book addresses the same set of issues for the developing countries, and the relationship of those countries to the richer parts of the world where most agricultural innovation still takes place. It also reviews developments within the CGIAR, along with the changing roles of international research generally, in light of the substantial shifts in science funding and policy (as well as in the science itself) that are taking place throughout the world. The book combines new evidence with economic theory and an economic way of thinking about science policy, as well as a set of in-depth, comparative country studies. These studies take us well beyond generalities, providing insights into the important changes taking place within these countries and others they represent. The information assembled here and the lessons learned in this volume argue for refocusing attention on agricultural R&amp;D as an instrument for long-run economic development to help avert a continuation of the chronic hunger and malnutrition that afflict all too many people around the world. These lessons will pay off if they help revitalize multinational engagement and investment in the global public benefits of international agricultural research. </p>

					<p> 
John Pender et al. (Eds), IFPRI, 2006Land degradation is a severe problem in the densely populated highlands of East Africa and elsewhere on the African continent. Soil erosion resulting from cultivation on steeply sloping terrain, mining of soil fertility due to continuous cultivation with limited application of inorganic or organic sources of soil nutrients, and deforestation and overgrazing of rangelands are among the key factors causing low agricultural productivity, widespread poverty, and food insecurity in the region. Finding ways to achieve more sustainable and productive land management is an urgent need, requiring policy, institutional, and technological strategies that are well targeted to the heterogeneous landscapes and diverse biophysical and socioeconomic contexts found in the East African highlands. The book is based on papers presented at the conference ‘Policies for Sustainable Land Management in the East African Highlands,’ held at UNECA in Addis Ababa in April 2002. The material focuses on land management issues in Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda, which include most of the people and area of the East African highlands. </p>

					<p> 
FAO Focus, March 2006Better forest management has a key role to play in dealing with climate change. Climate change and forests are intrinsically linked. On the one hand, changes in global climate are already stressing forests through higher mean annual temperatures, altered precipitation patterns and more frequent and extreme weather events. At the same time, forests and the wood they produce trap and store carbon dioxide, playing a major role in mitigating climate change. And on the flip side of the coin, when destroyed or over-harvested and burned, forests can become sources of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. FAO has warned that action should be taken now to manage these complex relationships in a more holistic manner. ‘We need to stop deforestation and expand the land area covered by forests, certainly,’ says Wulf Killmann, who chairs FAO’s interdepartmental climate change working group. ‘But we also need to substitute fossil fuels with biofuels - like wood fuels from responsibly managed forests -- in order to reduce carbon emissions, and we should use more wood in long-lasting products to keep trapped carbon out of the atmosphere for longer periods of time.’  </p>

					<p> 
Id21 Research Highlight, September 2006The productivity of irrigated smallholder agriculture in Africa is poor. Failure to consult women can be a major reason for poor results. To fulfil the potential of irrigated production, both women and men must contribute to designing and developing small-scale systems that are easy to use. Research from HR Wallingford Limited, UK, shows how a failure to consider gender issues contributes to poor performance in fourteen irrigation schemes in southern Africa. The author shows that a lack of participation from the outset - and particularly by women - is closely associated with poor agricultural performance and even people abandoning irrigation. The connection between irrigation design and workloads is poorly understood. Farmers do not always appreciate the implications of changing to irrigated production. Designers are preoccupied by efficient water distribution and may have limited experience of the many tasks involved in farming. Designers rarely consider the dynamics of working relationships between men and women, and the essential tasks they each do, prior to establishing irrigation systems. Irrigation agencies and donors emphasise potential profits rather than costs or risks. Each irrigated acre needs more preparation and greater labour and inputs investment. When irrigators depend on credit and water supply is inadequate, losses can be crippling. Paying electricity and water bills can be difficult for elderly people, widows, single mothers and those with many dependents. </p>

					<p> 
Edited by Nicci Diederichs, Sun Press, 2006While the use of medicinal plants in southern Africa is widely recognised for its cultural significance, as well as making an important contribution to primary health care and to livelihoods, the sector faces several challenges. Unsustainable harvesting is putting plant resources at risk, poor regulation is potentially putting human health at risk, and an influx of commercial producers is threatening small scale growers and traders. There is also very poor regulatory capacity to enforce sustainability or quality standards. This excellent guide does, however, offer some solutions. Several chapters focus on practical subjects such as sustainable harvesting techniques (including a detailed case study on the harvesting of tree bark), propagation and cultivation methods, including plant-based pest control. Useful tools includes lists of questions to be asked when assessing plant resources or monitoring the impact of harvesting. There are fact sheets covering over forty popular species, and chapters focussing on the economics of setting up a commercial operation, chemical analysis of medicinal properties and legislative frameworks.  </p>

					<p> Special issue, November 2006. Biofuels, including bioethanol, biodiesel and biogas, are renewable fuels generally produced from agricultural crops or organic matter such as livestock waste. In this edition of Focus on, we examine the case for and against existing mainstream biofuel technologies - and highlight some exciting alternatives. With rising oil prices, the debate over the viability of biofuels as an energy source for the future has been heating up. Increasing pressure on water resources, reduction in food production and loss of biodiversity are three objections to biofuel crops that have been cited in recent months. While these concerns must be addressed, the image of vast biofuel plantations causing habitat loss and environmental degradation is not the only vision on offer. Creating a viable biofuel industry, however, takes time and investment and these fuels need to be environmentally and economically sustainable if they are to provide a long-term option. Can biofuel crops with a bad reputation revive themselves - and what are the most compelling options for the future?</p>

InterAcademy Council, June 2006On the whole, the disproportionately small number of women in the science and technology (S&amp;T) enterprise, particularly in leadership positions, is a major hindrance to strengthening science capacity worldwide. Immediate action is needed to help remedy the under-representation of women in scientific and technical fields. The mandate of the IAC’s Advisory Panel on Women for science was to review previous studies, provide examples of effective projects already implemented, and issue a set of actionable recommendations addressed particularly to the world’s science and engineering academies. The panel’s recommendations and action items are grouped around three themes: academies advocating and promoting the education and careers of women; academies acting, both individually and jointly, to engage women in global capacity building; and academies building inclusive institutional climates and advising governments and other principal players on specific actions toward similar ends. </p>

					<p> 
Peter Hazell, and R. K. Pachauri (Eds), 2020 Focus No. 14, IFPRI, November 2006Bioenergy—that is, biofuels of biological and renewable origin, like bioethanol, biodiesel, and biomass for energy—is the subject of increasing attention around the world. Oil prices have climbed to unprecedented heights, and concerns about the environmental effects of fossil fuel use are on the rise. Bioenergy appears to offer hope for addressing these concerns while also providing new opportunities for poor people and farmers in developing countries. Can bioenergy fulfil the promise claimed by its proponents? Can it become an environmentally sustainable, economically viable, pro-poor source of energy? And what challenges will meeting these goals present? This set of policy briefs examines the potential opportunities and risks bioenergy may pose for poor people and farmers in developing countries. The briefs consider economic, social, environmental, and science and technology issues. They look at how increased bioenergy production may affect the global food balance and examine the need for further research and development in the bioenergy field. Lessons from the experiences of Europe, as well as Brazil and other developing countries, are reviewed. Recommendations on how to move forward to develop bioenergy in ways that can serve the poor and the environment are presented. </p>

					<p> 
IFPRI Forum, December 2006Global climate change poses particular risks to poor farmers in developing countries, but there are steps that farmers, policymakers, and researchers can take to minimize losses and adapt to climate change. Awareness of climate change and its risks has now made it firmly onto the international agenda. ‘Climate change is rapidly emerging as one of the most serious threats that humanity may ever face,’ said Kenyan Environment Minister Kivutha Kibwana at the UN Climate Change Conference in Nairobi on November 6. The conference brought together representatives of the 166 parties to the Kyoto Protocol. Agriculture will feel the effects of climate change through changes in both temperature and precipitation, and the availability of water for growing food. In addition, current weather extremes are likely to be exacerbated. It is likely that wet areas of the world will get even wetter, and dry areas will get drier. Thus, for example, monsoons in South Asia will intensify, while arid regions of Africa will become drier. IFPRI’s Mark Rosegrant points out that ‘Agriculture is the largest consumer of water globally, and as climate change alters the quantity and reliability of water supplies, it could threaten the welfare of millions of poor farmers.’ </p>

					<p> 
Sub-Saharan Africa must improve its scientific and technological capacity if it is to boost social and economic development. According to UNESCO, there is less than one scientist or engineer for every ten thousand people in Africa — compared with two to five per thousand in Europe and the United States. But experts disagree on how to improve this capacity. Some suggest investing in select institutes as centres of excellence; others argue that efforts should focus on strengthening existing infrastructure. Some think policymakers should support capabilities within individual firms, while many believe that informal research and development activities, or cross-sector networks, best encourage industrialisation. This spotlight provides relevant articles, background reading and links. <a href="http://www.scidev.net/dossiers/index.cfm?fuseaction=specifictopics&amp;dossier=13&amp;topic=183&amp;CFID=6210450&amp;CFTOKEN=13924430" target="_self">http://www.scidev.net/dossiers/index.cfm?fuseaction=specifictopics&amp;dossier=13&amp;topic=183&amp;CFID=6210450&amp;CFTOKEN=13924430</a>  </p>
