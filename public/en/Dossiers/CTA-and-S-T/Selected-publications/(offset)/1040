						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>
By Shenggen Fan and Mark Rosegrant, IFPRI Policy Brief 3, June 2008. In many parts of the world, increased agricultural growth will play a key role in addressing the current world food crisis, in contributing to overall economic growth, and in helping to achieve the first Millennium Development Goal of halving the proportion of poor and hungry people by 2015 (MDG1). The challenge of meeting MDG1 under the current circumstances is considerable, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Of the means used to promote agricultural growth, sound government spending can be one of the most direct and effective. This brief presents ranges of estimates of the costs involved using two different approaches. </p>

					<p>In conformity with the decision of seventeen West and Central African countries, members of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS), on the organization of the West African Catalogue of Plant Species and Varieties (COAFEV), this document presents the list of varieties or varietal types whose seeds can be produced and commercialized within the territory made up by the seventeen Member States. It is the aggregate of the varieties registered in the national catalogues of the Member States. To be registered in the West African Catalogue of Plant Species and Varieties, a variety must be previously registered in a national catalogue. This document, that constitutes the first version of the COAFEV, also lists the most widely disseminated varieties within the Members States. This variety list has been established based on data provided by the Member States. After a period of transition of five years, this catalogue will only contain varieties registered in the Member States catalogues.</p>

US Climate Change Science Program, Synthesis and Assessment Product 3.1, July 2008. The use of computers to simulate complex systems has grown in the past few decades to play a central role in many areas of science. Climate modelling is one of the best examples of this trend and one of the great success stories of scientific simulation. Building a laboratory analogue of the Earth’s climate system with all its complexity is impossible. Instead, the successes of climate modelling allow us to address many questions about climate by experimenting with simulations – that is, with mathematical models of the climate system. Despite the success of the climate modelling enterprise, the complexity of our Earth imposes important limitations on existing climate models. This report aims to help the reader understand the valid uses, as well as the limitations, of current climate models.</p>

World Bank, UNDP, UNEP, World Resources Institute. Three-quarters of the world’s poorest citizens – those living on less than $2 per day – are dependent on the environment for a significant part of their daily livelihoods. Climate change, therefore, adds a real urgency to the efforts of the many institutions that work to improve the lives of the poor. World Resources 2008 argues that properly designed enterprises can create economic, social, and environmental resilience that cushion the impacts of climate change, and help provide needed social stability. Increased resilience must be part of the response to the risks of climate change. The efforts that foster resilience chart the first steps on the path out of poverty. What can we say with some certainty about environment and development as we approach the end of the first decade of the 21st century?</p>

Indigenous Information Network and International Alliance of Indigenous and Tribal Peoples of the Tropical Forests (IAITPTF). Drought is generally defined as a temporary reduction in moisture availability that is significantly below the normal for a specified period. Culturally, the definition of drought depends on local perceptions. It is essential to understand local perception of drought. Causes of drought in Africa are related to climate variability and non-availability of surface water resources. Droughts are frequent and severe in many countries of Sub-Saharan Africa and have a devastating impact on their peoples and economies. The extreme vulnerability to rainfall in the arid and semiarid areas of the continent and the poor capacity of most African soils to retain moisture result in almost 60 percent of Subsaharan Africa being vulnerable to drought and 30 percent being extremely vulnerable. The frequent drought impacts the social, environmental, and economical standard of living of the indigenous peoples.</p>

By Valdete Berisha-Krasniqi et al., IFPRI Briefing Note, July 2008. The benefits least developed countries (LDCs) can draw from a multilateral trade reform as designed by the modalities made public in May 2008 are negligible, and some countries will even face adverse effects. World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiators should make a supplementary effort in favor of the poorest countries. The Duty-Free Quota-Free (DFQF) Initiative moves in the right direction, but it should be extended not only from a product point of view—with a 100, not 97, percent application—but also in terms of geographic coverage. This initiative has to be supported by both Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) and BrIC (Brazil, India, and China) countries. It is in the interests of Asian LDCs to prioritize full openness of OECD markets (a 100-percent DFQF regime) and full access to the U.S. market in particular, while African countries will draw more benefits from a geographic extension of this regime to BrIC countries.</p>

					<p>
By Jamie Morrison et al., Economic and Social Perspectives Policy Brief 1, July 2008. The prices of many staple food commodities have increased substantially over the past year. As a result, many developing countries are facing larger food import bills. The cereal import bill of the world’s poorest countries is forecast to rise by 56 percent in 2007/08, following an already significant increase of 37 percent in 2006/07. Given the growing dependency of many developing countries on imported food commodities and on foreign aid, as well as their generally high levels of debt, increasing food prices have important implications for growth and development. At the micro level, poor households in both food importing and food exporting countries are exceptionally vulnerable to increases in food prices, given the large share of food in total expenditure and the constraints they face in terms of low income and capital endowment. On the other hand, higher global food prices present an opportunity for agriculture. </p>

					<p>
Terrestrial Carbon Group, terrestrialcarbon.org, July 2008. Human-induced climate change is caused by the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases have only two other places to go: the oceans and the terrestrial system (including land and vegetation). The best available science tells us that to have a 50% chance of avoiding dangerous climate change, we must stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere below 450 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) by 2050. As better information has become available, climate scientists have revised this ‘safe’ concentration downwards, with some now arguing for 350 ppm. The concentration of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere at a particular time is determined by the net volume of greenhouse gasses emitted and sequestered up to that time, rather than by an emissions rate at that time. It is therefore more useful to speak in terms of a ‘carbon budget’ than an emission reduction target.</p>

National Academy of Sciences, Report in Brief, July 2008.Increased agricultural productivity is a major stepping stone on the path out of poverty in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, but farmers there face tremendous challenges improving production. Poor soil, inefficient water use, and a lack of access to plant breeding resources, nutritious animal feed, high quality seed, and fuel and electricity—combined with some of the most extreme environmental conditions on Earth—have made yields in crop and animal production far lower in these regions than world averages. This report identifies sixty emerging technologies with the potential to significantly improve agricultural productivity in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Eighteen technologies are recommended for immediate development or further exploration.</p>

WBCSD, July 2008. This new report published by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and IUCN presents details of trends in agricultural production and consumption to help governments, farmers, consumers and industry better understand the challenges facing the sustainable management of agricultural ecosystems, such as meeting demands from a fast-growing world population, adapting to climate change impacts, and managing the natural resources of an increasingly depleted planet. On climate change, the report notes that while agriculture is directly affected by changing temperatures, rainfall and the spread of invasive species, it is also a major source of greenhouse gas emissions originating from fertilizer use, livestock and wetland rice production, burning of agricultural residues, or conversion of long-term grassland. According to the report, the challenge is thus ‘to adapt agriculture fast enough to a changing climate, and to shift production practices to reduce and preferably mitigate the carbon footprint of the food production system.’</p>

					<p>
International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), 2008.This report on the World Bank’s proposal for a Global Forest Partnership warns that the Bank will have to heed the advice of hundreds of experts IIED consulted if it is to make a real breakthrough in tackling the problems of past decades and the weaknesses of typical international forest programmes. More than 600 forest experts responded to IIED’s survey or participated in focus groups in Brazil, China, Ghana, Guyana, India, Russia and Mozambique, as well as at international meetings. A majority agreed a new partnership was needed to protect forests and forest-based livelihoods, but pointed out several ways in which it should diverge from the Bank’s initial idea if it is to really serve local needs on an equitable basis with the rapidly changing global forestry agenda. IIED also reviewed more than 50 existing initiatives to identify the proposed alliance’s potential partners and the gaps it could fill. The consultation identified key features that would make a truly progressive global partnership and a new way for international forestry to work. It should focus on empowering primary stakeholders such as forest dwellers so that their rights, knowledge and needs are centre-stage. It should greatly improve flows of finance to activities that support local needs alongside global public goods such as carbon storage. It should interact effectively with other sectors such as water and agriculture, where the underlying causes of forest problems – and the seeds of sustainable solutions – are often lodged.

By C. Breisinger et al., IFPRI Discussion Paper 784, August 2008. This paper has been prepared in support of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) roundtable in Ghana. The study also takes a fresh perspective on the role of agriculture for development in light of the global food crisis. It addresses two main questions: what are the impacts of Green-revolution type agricultural growth to reach the CAADP goal in Ghana? Given the large investments required to achieve such productivity-led growth, what is the sector’s contribution to the overall economy? Results from the dynamic computable general equilibrium model suggest that by closing the existing yield gaps in crop production and supporting essential growth in the livestock sector Ghana can achieve CAADP’s 6 percent growth target. In this process, agriculture supports the rest of the economy through substantial and largely invisible monetary transfers to the non-agricultural sectors, which are primarily driven by the reduction of domestic food prices. </p>

Charlotte Streck et al, Brookings Institution Press, 2008. Once the province of think tanks, academics, and global agencies such as the UN, climate change has finally penetrated the world’s consciousness. To date, international attention has focused primarily on the industrial and energy sectors. However, the agriculture, forestry, and land use sector is a major driver of the climate change problem and, thus, must be an integral part of the solution. In this wide-ranging volume, international experts explain the links between climate change and forests, highlighting the potential role of this sector within emerging climate policy frameworks and carbon markets. After framing forestry activities within the larger context of climate-change policy, the contributors analyze the operation and efficacy of market-based mechanisms for forest conservation and climate change. Drawing on project examples from around the world, the authors present concrete recommendations for policymakers, project developers, and market participants. They discuss sequestration rights in Chile, carbon offset programs in Australia and New Zealand, and emerging policy incentives at all levels of the U.S. government. The book also explores the different voluntary schemes for carbon crediting, provides an overview of carbon accounting best practices, and presents tools for use in future sequestration and offset programs. It concludes by considering a range of incentive options for slowing deforestation and protecting the world’s remaining forests.</p>

					<p>
By Liangzhi You and Michael Johnson, Discussion Paper No. 776, July 2008Agriculture plays a dominant role in nearly all the countries of East and Central Africa, and many face similar agroecological, climatic, and development challenges. As a result, significant scale economies can be made through the regionalization of research and development (R&amp;D) using networks such as the Association for Strengthening Agricultural Research in Eastern and Central Africa. The challenge for such networks, however, is to determine both regional and national research priorities with the highest potential rates of economic return. Methodology to assess regional research priorities is a critical input into this process, particularly when it comes to weighing likely complementarities among individual research programs, thus maximizing impact across countries at the regional level.</p>

					<p>
Agriculture for Development Policy Brief, World Bank World Development Report 2008Biofuels offer a potential source of renewable energy and could lead to large new markets for agricultural producers. However, few current biofuel programs are economically viable, and most have social and environmental costs: upward pressure on food prices, intensified competition for land and water, and possibly deforestation. National biofuel strategies need to be based on a thorough assessment of those opportunities and costs. Globally, lower tariffs and subsidies in industrial countries will be essential for ensuring efficient allocation of biofuels production and guaranteeing social benefits to small farmers in developing countries.</p>

					<p>
FEWS NET, 2008The FEWS NET Outlook for Southern Africa incorporates the findings from six country outlooks for the period October 2007 to March 2008. This outlook provides a basis for regional and global resource allocation and contingency planning, as well as in-country planning. This report summarizes the results of this process for Southern Africa, highlighting what FEWS NET believes are the major threats to food security in the period October 2007 to March 2008. The most likely regional food security scenario between October 2007 and March 2008 is a continued decline in food security conditions in areas now facing moderate to high levels of food insecurity as noted above. The worst case scenario would arise if the assumptions under the most likely scenario do not hold, and instead, conditions deteriorate leading to extremely high levels of food insecurity, particularly in Zimbabwe and southern and central Mozambique, countries which face moderate to extreme food insecurity even in the most likely scenario. The situation would be further exacerbated if rainfall performance is poor with a delayed start and/or lengthy dry spells.</p>
