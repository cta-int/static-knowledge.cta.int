						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	By International Energy Agency (IEA), February 2010. IIED has published an information paper entitled ‘Sustainable Production of Second-Generation Biofuels: Potential and Perspectives in Major Economies and Developing Countries”. The paper focuses on opportunities and risks presented by second-generation biofuels technologies in eight case study countries: Brazil, Cameroon, China, India, Mexico, South Africa, Tanzania and Thailand. The report begins by exploring state-of-the-art second-generation technologies and their production, followed by projections of future demand and a discussion of drivers of that demand. The report then delves into various feedstock options and the global potential for bioenergy production. The final chapter offers a look at the potential for sustainable second-generation biofuel production in developing countries including considerations of economic, social and environmental impacts.</p>

	By A. Vatn; P. Vedeld and J.G. Petursson, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, 2009. This paper examines whether reduced emissions from forests – from deforestation and forest degradation (the REDD project) – should be included in a post-Kyoto agreement. It focuses on how REDD could be instituted at the national level, and sheds light on specific challenges for two African countries – Tanzania and Uganda. The paper demonstrates that REDD would require an international agreement concerning its role and format and an international governance structure to distribute the resources involved. It would also need national governance structures in countries where REDD activities are supposed to take place to ensure that measures are instituted on the ground.</p>

					<p>By An Michiels, Bonwoo Koo, IFPRI Discussion Paper, 2008. Plant transformation research has achieved outstanding progress in the development of transgenic crops over the past decades, and the research results have been spread through journal publications and patents. With the recent emergence of stronger intellectual property rights, investments in crop research and the landscape of plant transformation research have changed, along with the patterns of knowledge dissemination. In this paper, the recent trends in plant transformation research are discussed by examining patent and journal publication data during the last decade. The data analysis shows that there have been significant shifts toward applied research by developing countries and toward patenting as a means of knowledge dissemination during the past few decades, reflecting the increasing role of the private sector in developing countries in crop improvement research.</p>

					<p>By World Intellectual Property Organization, 2009. Indigenous and local communities cherish traditional knowledge (TK) as a part of their cultural identities. The work of the WIPO Intergovernmental committee on intellectual property and genetic resources, traditional knowledge and folklore (“IGC”) ranges from the international dimension of TK and cooperation with other international agencies, to capacity building and the pooling of practical experience in this complex area. This publication gives an overview of this work, discusses some key concepts and describes various national approaches to protecting TK against misuse or misappropriation. </p>

	By Center for Ocean Solutions 2009. The Pacific Ocean faces threats that will render some coastal areas uninhabitable. Pollution such as sewage, runoff from land and toxic waste; habitat destruction; over-fishing; and climate change leading to sea level rise, ocean acidification and warming will all interact to damage the ocean's ecology and coastal economies. These are among the findings of 'Pacific Ocean Synthesis', a report by the US-based Center for Ocean Solutions (COS) that reviewed more than 3,400 scientific articles and reports from 50 countries in the Pacific basin. The report was presented at the World Ocean Conference in Manado, Indonesia, this month (11–15 May). </p>

					<p>This discussion paper examines the relationship between geopolitical factors and scientific activity based on publication data from a 30-year period (1980 to 2009). Using bibliometric methods, the analysis concentrates on large-scale, secular movements in the geopolitics of knowledge creation. First, the evolution of the scientific outputs of the countries of the former USSR and Eastern Bloc is examined followed by that of the Middle East. The paper then looks at how the global map of science has been reshaped in Asia’s favour.</p>

					<p>The professionalization of breeding and its separation from farming leads to the emergence of a commercial seed system, alongside the farmers’ seed systems through which farmers traditionally save, exchange and sell seeds, often informally. This shift has led to grant temporary monopoly privileges to plant breeders and patent-holders through the tools of intellectual property, as a means to encourage research and innovation in plant breeding. In this process, however, the poorest farmers may become increasingly dependent on expensive inputs, creating the risk of indebtedness in the face of unstable incomes. Private-led research may seek to satisfy the needs of farmers in industrialized countries, while neglecting those of poor farmers in developing countries. The farmers’ seed systems may be put in jeopardy, although most farmers in developing countries still rely on such systems, which, for them, are a source of economic independence and resilience in the face of threats such as pests, diseases or climate change. Finally, agrobiodiversity may be threatened by the uniformization encouraged by the spread of commercial varieties. The present report explores how States could implement seed policies that contribute to the full realization of human rights. It identifies how research and development could best serve the poorest farmers in developing countries, and how commercial seed systems could be regulated to serve the right to food and ensure the right of all to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress. Finally, it examines how farmers’ seed systems could be best supported, in order to serve the interest of all in the preservation of agrobiodiversity.Author: O. de Schutter, Special Rapporteur on the right to food, UN, July 2009</p>

					<p>Food systems of indigenous peoples who retain connection to long-evolved cultures and patterns of living in local ecosystems present a treasure of knowledge that contributes to well-being and health, and can benefit all humankind. This book seeks to define and describe the diversity in food system use, nutrition and health in 12 rural case studies of indigenous peoples in different parts of the world as a window to global indigenous peoples’ circumstances. A procedure for documenting indigenous peoples’ food systems was developed by researchers working with the Centre for Indigenous Peoples’ Nutrition and Environment (CINE) at McGill University, Canada, and the FAO. The procedure was adapted and applied in case studies located in Canada, Japan, Peru, India, Nigeria, Colombia, Thailand, Kenya, and the Federated States of Micronesia. The collective intent of this documentation is to show the inherent strengths of the local traditional food systems, how people think about and use these foods, the influx of industrial and purchased food, and the circumstances of the nutrition transition in indigenous communities. This research was completed with both qualitative and quantitative methods by indigenous peoples and their academic partners in the context of the second International Decade of the World’s Indigenous Peoples, and the Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples adopted in 2007 by the General Assembly of the UN.Authors: H.V.

					<p>This report describes the current status of conservation and use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (PGRFA) throughout the world. It is based on 106 country reports, two regional syntheses, several thematic studies and published literature. It describes the most significant changes that have taken place since the first State of the World’s Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (SoW) was published in 1996 and describes major continuing gaps and needs. The structure follows that of the first SoW report with an additional chapter on the contribution of PGRFA to food security and sustainable agricultural development. The other chapters cover the following subjects: the state of diversity; the state of in situ management; the state of ex situ conservation; the state of use; the state of national programmes, training needs, and legislation; the state of regional and international collaboration; and access to plant genetic resources, the sharing of benefits derived from their use and the realization of farmers’ rights.Author: FAO, Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, 2009</p>

					<p>This paper warns sub-Saharan Africa that it must now start adapting its agricultural sector to expected climate shifts or risk a severe economic crisis in the future. Chambwera and Macgregor found that the effects of climate change in Tanzania could have devastating consequences for the nation's entire economic system. Using sophisticated macroeconomic computer models to attempt to estimate the exact economic toll of climate change in this part of the world, researchers have estimated that by the year 2085 Tanzania could see a drop of up to 68 percent in its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) due to the effects of climate change on its agricultural sector. Tanzania was chosen for this study, which is the first in its kind, because the nation's high levels of poverty, high percentage of rural population, and high susceptibility to shifts in its climate make it an ideal test case. The study based its research on scientific predictions that temperatures in East Africa are expected to rise by two to four degrees centigrade by the end of the century. Although some crops will actually benefit from the change in temperature and rainfall, the staple crops of most East African farmers will significantly suffer.Authors: M. Chambwera &amp; J.

					<p>By International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), 2009. Small-scale, resource-poor farmers in developing countries face daily stresses, including poor soils, drought, and lack of inputs. Ongoing trends such as climate change and population growth will likely exacerbate binding stresses. A new generation of genetically engineered (GE) crop research aims to alleviate these pressures through the improvement of subsistence crops—such as cassava, sorghum, and millet—that incorporate traits such as tolerance to drought, water, and aluminum in soils as well as plants with more efficient nitrogen and phosphor use. However, many developing countries lack the necessary biosafety systems for a timely and cost-effective adoption. This brief focuses on the regulatory reforms necessary for farmers and consumers in developing countries to benefit from GE crops.</p>

					<p>By International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), 2010. This paper discusses micro-level practices for adapting to climate change that are available to small-scale farmers in Africa. The analysis is based on a review of 17 studies about practices that boost small-scale farmers’ resilience or reduce their vulnerability to observed or expected changes in climate; it includes data from more than 16 countries in Africa, the Americas, Europe, and Asia. The review shows that African smallholders are already using a wide variety of creative practices to deal with climate risks; these can be further adjusted to the challenge of climate change by planned adaptation programs. 104 different practices were found relevant to climate change adaptation and are organized in five categories: farm management and technology; farm financial management; diversification on and beyond the farm; government interventions in infrastructure, health, and risk reduction; and knowledge management, networks, and governance. </p>

					<p>By FAO, February 2010. Urgent investments, major agricultural research efforts and robust governance are required to ensure that the world's livestock sector responds to a growing demand for animal products and at the same time contributes to poverty reduction, food security, environmental sustainability and human health. The report stresses that livestock is essential to the livelihoods of around one billion poor people. Livestock provides income, high-quality food, fuel, draught power, building material and fertilizer, thus contributing to food security and nutrition. For many small-scale farmers, livestock also provides an important safety net in times of need. </p>

					<p>By WWF-TPO, March 2009. Biofuels remain a highly contentious issue in Tanzania. There has been a huge wave of foreign investors into the country since 2005. Many of these investors are proposing that they will be carrying out socially and environmentally responsible programmes, however details surrounding how precisely they will achieve these remain unclear. The overall aim of this study is to highlight, with concrete examples, the challenges involved as large-scale biofuel investments are carried out in Tanzania. Following a previous WWF study into biofuels, this study aims to look at some of the major issues involved with biofuels in Tanzania and assess how investors can develop their businesses successfully, whilst simultaneously mitigating negative environmental impacts and maximising gains for rural development and Tanzania in general.</p>

					<p>By DEVFISH, 2009. Fisheries are an extremely important resource for Pacific Island peoples. Much of the region’s nutrition, welfare, culture, recreation, government revenue and employment are derived from fisheries, especially tuna. The Pacific Ocean is one of the world’s most valuable tuna fisheries and its sustainable development is crucial to the long-term economic and social wellbeing of the region. Although this is a very lucrative fishery, most Pacific Island Countries are still to realise the full potential of their tuna resources. For example, in 2008 Pacific ACP countries caught only $604 million USD worth of tuna within their own waters, while foreign fleets fishing in the same waters caught over $2.05 billion USD. </p>

					<p>By Graham Brookes, Tun-Hsiang Yu, Simla Tokgoz, and Amani Elobeid, January 2010. The working paper The Production and Price Impact of Biotech Crops, discuss about the production effects of the technology and impacts on cereal and oilseed markets through the use of agricultural commodity models. It analyzes the impacts on global production, consumption, trade and prices in the soybean, canola and corn sectors. The effect of no longer using the current widely used biotech traits in the corn, soybean and canola sectors would probably impact negatively on both the global supply and utilization of these crops, their derivatives and related markets for grain and oilseeds.</p>

					<p>By Falck-Zepeda, José, Cavalieri, Anthony and Zambrano, Patricia, International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), 2009. Small-scale, resource-poor farmers in developing countries face daily stresses, including poor soils, drought, and lack of inputs. Ongoing trends such as climate change and population growth will likely exacerbate binding stresses. A new generation of genetically engineered (GE) crop research aims to alleviate these pressures through the improvement of subsistence crops—such as cassava, sorghum, and millet—that incorporate traits such as tolerance to drought, water, and aluminium in soils as well as plants with more efficient nitrogen and phosphor use. However, many developing countries lack the necessary biosafety systems for a timely and cost-effective adoption. This brief focuses on the regulatory reforms necessary for farmers and consumers in developing countries to benefit from GE crops.</p>

					<p>By Dominic Glover, STEPS Working Paper 15, Brighton: STEPS Centre, 2009. Many people and organisations have sought to promote genetically modified (GM, transgenic) crops as a ‘pro-poor’ technology. However, developing-country farmers’ experiences with GM crops have been mixed. Some farmers have certainly benefited, but others have not. Predictably, the performance and impacts of transgenic crops depend critically on a range of technical, socio-economic and institutional factors. By themselves, genetically modified seeds are not enough to guarantee a good harvest or to create a sustainable and productive farm livelihood.</p>

					<p>By Friends of the Earth International, November 2007. This report presents nine stories about the impact of climate change from different countries around the world. These case studies chronicle specific impacts and provide testimonies of local community members who have dramatic first-hand experience of devastating climate events. They also describe their perceptions of the various challenges faced by policymakers, decision-makers, and even the local populations themselves. While some regions are suffering from floods, others are experiencing severe drought and increasing desertification, all of which is fostering more hunger, thirst, disease and displacement. Stories on Mali a dry land confronts a warming world; Swaziland facing the heat and Tuvalu islanders lose ground to rising seas </p>
