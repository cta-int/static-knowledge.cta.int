						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>International Council for Science, October 2008, prepared for the 29th General Assembly. At a minimum, ICSU-led reflection might peel apart some of the traditional assumptions about other sciences and lead to a new accord or understanding among disciplines. ICSU has not spent much time in the past in introspection but a little navel gazing in this regard might be well worth the effort. Fast-tracking more social sciences into ICSU will not only ‘strengthen international science for the benefit of society’ but will better fit ICSU for the decades ahead. The sting in the tail may be that without a stronger affirmation from ICSU about the value-added of social sciences to its work, ICSU may not be attractive enough to the social science unions it needs to successfully engage them within its formal structures.</p>

					<p>By Amelia Goh, Helga Recke, Dee Hahn-rollins and Laura Guyer-miller, CGIAR, September 2008, Working Paper 48. While women produce 60 to 80 percent of crops in sub-Saharan Africa, less than one in five of its agricultural scientists is female. The lack of gender balance among the scientists and leadership of African agriculture research institutes puts them in danger of missing the range of diverse perspectives necessary to develop appropriate technologies, leading to less optimal research results and impacts. The agricultural science, technology and innovation capacity of Africa would be significantly strengthened through greater participation of its women.</p>

					<p>Sahel and West Africa Club/OECD, SWAC Briefing Note, 2 September 2008. This paper addresses the opportunities, challenges and risks related to the development of bio-fuels in the Sahel and West Africa where problems of food security and purchasing power are most keenly felt. After covering the facts and debate surrounding green fuel, this paper presents the national and regional policies and strategies regarding food and land issues. A Code of Good Conduct setting out the conditions for a “Green Fuel for Development” label could reconcile West Africa’s trade, energy and food goals while allowing the region to find a place in the new world energy market. </p>

					<p>
FAO, 2008. The State of Food and Agriculture 2008 explores the implications of the rapid recent growth in production of biofuels based on agricultural commodities. The growing demand for agricultural commodities for the production of biofuels is having significant repercussions on agricultural markets, and concerns are mounting over their negative impact on the food security of millions of people across the world. But biofuels also offer the opportunity for agricultural and rural development – if appropriate policies and investments are put in place. This report reviews the current state of the debate and the available evidence on these critical questions. It finds that concerted efforts to reform policies and invest in agriculture will be essential if the risks associated with biofuels areto be reduced, and the opportunities more widely shared.</p>

First, an overview is provided of the current status regarding bioenergy, focusing on first- and second-generation liquid biofuels, including the major reasons for the big interest as well as current concerns about them. Some of the potential ways in which biotechnology could contribute to this area are then considered, covering production of biomass as well as conversion of the biomass to first- or second generation liquid biofuels, in addition to production of biodiesel from microalgae and production of biogas. A small number of issues of specific relevance to the debate are briefly described while some of the kinds of specific questions that should be addressed in the conference are listed</p>

					<p>
In a three-year collaborative effort, the World Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) jointly produced the <i>Gender in Agriculture Sourcebook</i> which draws from the operations of the three agencies.
 
The<i> Gender in Agriculture Sourcebook</i> presents a rich compilation of experiences, some of them ongoing, in which agricultural projects have incorporated gender-related components or adapted their operations to allow for gender variables and engage issues that affect men and women differently. These very often carry great practical consequence for the respective potentials of men and women as agricultural producers. The experiences chronicled capture a rich blend of hopeful innovations and cautionary lessons about the importance of avoiding the pitfalls of &quot;gender-neutral&quot; operations in areas in which gender issues are a salient variable in agricultural production - namely in the large majority of rural settings in low-income countries where agriculture remains a major engine of economic growth. Other lessons emerge from projects in middle income developing countries.
 
The Sourcebook covers 16 modules including: (1) Food Security; (2) Policy and Governance; (3) Rural Finance; (4) Land Policy and Administration; (5) Agricultural Markets; (6) Agricultural Water Management; (7) Agricultural Innovation and Education; (8) Agricultural Labor; (9) Rural Infrastructure; (10) Natural Resource Management; (11) Disaster and Post-Conflict Management; (12) Crop Agriculture; (13) Fisheries and Aquaculture; (14) Livestock; (15) Forestry; and (16) Monitoring and Evaluation.
 
More than 100 authors and reviewers contributed to its production, which continues after the print release of the publication on October 8, 2008. An on-line edition will serve as a &quot;living document&quot; to which additional chapters will be added. Post print chapters already include a note on property and inheritance rights among widows and children in households affected by HIV and AIDS in Africa, and profiles of project activities in El Salvador and labor legislation in Chile, among others.

					<p>The 9th Annual Conference of Science &amp; Technology in Society, to be held on 28-29 of March 2009, provides a professional and interactive venue for graduate students from Science &amp; Technology Policy (STP), Science &amp; Technology Studies (STS), and related fields including, but not limited to, health, energy and environment, space, information and communications, and other emerging areas. In developing the agenda for the conference, the organizing committee's primary goal is to create a forum that encourages intellectual exchange between STP and STS by assembling panels around similar themes. As such, the committee will accept the strongest proposals. This year's agenda will emphasize international perspectives of science and technology. In addition to presenting papers and receiving constructive feedback on their research, students will have the opportunity to interact with each other and prominent scholars and professionals related to their field of interest. Every year we invite prominent figures from both STP and STS to deliver keynote addresses. Because we draw participants from all over the world, this conference is an excellent opportunity for young scholars aspiring to work in academic, governmental, or nongovernmental settings to build both national and international networks for future research and collaboration.

					<p>In 2007 and 2008, the role of input subsidies in stimulating growth and addressing food security and poverty alleviation objectives has re-emerged as an important agricultural policy debate. The sharp increases in world food and fertilizer prices created a sense of urgency in meeting productivity and social welfare goals. It put fertilizer subsidies high on the list of options for government and donor responses to the crisis.</p>

					<p>
By H.K. Gibbs et al., Environ. Res. Lett. 3 034001, July 2008. Biofuels from land-rich tropical countries may help displace foreign petroleum imports for many industrialized nations, providing a possible solution to the twin challenges of energy security and climate change. But concern is mounting that crop-based biofuels will increase net greenhouse gas emissions if feedstocks are produced by expanding agricultural lands. Here we quantify the ‘carbon payback time’ for a range of biofuel crop expansion pathways in the tropics. We use a new, geographically detailed database of crop locations and yields, along with updated vegetation and soil biomass estimates, to provide carbon payback estimates that are more regionally specific than those in previous studies. Using this cropland database, we also estimate carbon payback times under different scenarios of future crop yields, biofuel technologies, and petroleum sources. No foreseeable changes in agricultural or energy technology will be able to achieve meaningful carbon benefits if crop-based biofuels are produced at the expense of tropical forests.</p>

					<p>
By Lorenzo Cotula, Nat Dyer and Sonja Vermeulen, FAO and IIED, 2008. Recent years have witnessed a rapid and accelerating expansion of bioethanol and biodiesel production. This expansion is driven by government targets for biofuel substitution in energy budgets for transport, driven in turn by concerns about high oil prices, prospects for rural development, export opportunities and means to mitigate climate change. The study draws on a literature review, and on intelligence and information provided by key informants by email or telephone. It aims to pave the way for future empirical research on the links between the spread of biofuels and access to land, through developing a conceptual framework for such research and through taking stock of data available in the literature. The study finds that biofuels can be instrumental in bringing an agricultural renaissance that revitalises land use and livelihoods in rural areas.</p>

					<p>By Samuel Benin, James Thurlow, Xinshen Diao, Allen Kebba, and Nelson Ofwono, IFPRI Discussion Paper No. 790, September 2008. Over the past two decades, Uganda has experienced strong economic growth. However, agriculture has not performed as well as the rest of the economy in recent years, and while the incidence of poverty has declined, it is still substantially higher in rural rather than urban areas. The Ugandan government, within the framework of its Plan for the Modernization of Agriculture (PMA) and the Prosperity for All (PFA) initiative, and in support of the upcoming National Development Plan, is in the process of implementing the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP), which provides an integrated framework of development priorities aimed at restoring agricultural growth, rural development and food security. This paper analyzes the agricultural growth and investment options that can support the development of a comprehensive rural development component under Uganda's National Development Plan in alignment with the principles and objectives of the CAADP, which include achievement of six percent agricultural growth and allocation of at least ten percent of budgetary resources to the agricultural sector.</p>

United Nations Environment Programme, September 2008. Green Jobs: Towards Decent Work in a Sustainable, Low-Carbon World is the first comprehensive report on the emergence of a “green economy” and its impact on the world of work in the 21st Century. Until now, there has been much anecdotal evidence indicating that the pattern of employment is indeed changing—and that new jobs are beginning to emerge in favor of greener, cleaner and more sustainable occupations. This report shows for the first time at global level that green jobs are being generated in some sectors and economies. This is in large part as a result of climate change and the need to meet emission reduction targets under the UN climate convention. This has led to changing patterns of investment flows—flows into areas from renewable energy generation up to energy efficiency projects at the household and industrial level.It now appears that a green economy can generate more and better jobs everywhere and that these can be decent jobs.</p>

					<p>
By Neil Bird and Leo Peskett, ODI, September 2008. Governments worldwide are debating how best to respond to the many challenges set by climate change. Within this debate there is growing recognition that national funding efforts need to be complemented by additional finance at the international level. Over the past year, a whole range of traditional donor countries have created new funds to support climate change programmes in developing countries. These include the governments of Australia, Germany, Japan, Spain and the UK, together with the European Union (Box 1), with pledges totalling $2.7 billion per year over the next few years. The impetus behind these new financial mechanisms has been, partly, a frustration with existing frameworks for technology trans¬fer and investment that are not sufficiently responsive to the global challenges of climate change. However, these initiatives raise some important questions about the underlying rela¬tionship between the North and South. Recent ODI research into these new funding mechanisms (see useful resources) has raised a number of issues that need addressing. </p>

					<p>
Odi, Briefing Paper 41, September 2008. The latest World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiation round, launched in November 2001 in Doha, was seen as a positive response to the terrorist attacks on the USA. The negotiations, known as the ‘Development Round’, had the ultimate objectives of reducing poverty and promoting development. Seven years later, the outlook is bleak. The Doha talks were suspended in July 2008, with trade negotiators increasingly lacking support from their governments. Future elections and rising food and energy prices have exacerbated protectionist tendencies and shifted the focus from international develop¬ment to self-interest. There are serious concerns as to whether talks can be revived.It is often argued that the success of Doha would only benefit big developing countries such as Brazil, China or India, while African countries and, in particular, smallholder farm¬ers, would lose. This argument assumes that African countries lack the capacity to benefit from broad tariff cuts on the export side and would become more vulnerable on the import side if tariffs were reduced still further. However, the caveat ‘the devil is in the detail’ is nowhere more appropriate than in trade negotiations. Without knowing whether Doha will finally succeed and, if so, what a compromise would look like, we cannot finally determine who will win, and who will lose. </p>

					<p>By James Thurlow, Samuel Benin, Xinshen Diao, Henrietta Kalinda, and Thomson Kalinda, IFPRI Discussion Paper No. 791, September 2008. Zambia has experienced strong economic performance since 1999. However, agriculture has not performed as well as the rest of the economy, and although the incidence of poverty has declined, it still remains high. The Zambian government, within the framework of the Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP), is in the process of implementing the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP), which provides an integrated framework of development priorities aimed at restoring agricultural growth, rural development and food security. This paper analyzes the agricultural growth and investment options that can support the development of a comprehensive rural development component under Zambia's FNDP, in alignment with the principles and objectives of the CAADP, which include the achievement of six percent agricultural growth and allocation of at least ten percent of budgetary resources to the sector. Computable general equilibrium (CGE) model results indicate that it is possible for Zambia to reach the CAADP target of six percent agricultural growth, but this will require additional growth in all crops and sub-sectors. Zambia cannot rely on only maize or higher-value export crops to achieve this growth target; broader-based agricultural growth, including increases in fisheries and livestock, will be important. </p>

					<p>For the African Workshop on Adaptation Implementation of Decision 1/CP.10 of the UNFCCC Convention Accra, Ghana, 21 - 23 September, 2006. The Conference of the Parties (COP), by its decision 1/CP.10, requested the secretariat to organize regional workshops, reflecting regional priorities, before the thirteenth session of the Conference of the Parties (November 2007), in order to facilitate information exchange and integrated assessments to assist in identifying specific adaptation needs and concerns. This paper presents background information as input to the African Regional Workshop on Adaptation (Accra, Ghana, 21- 23 September, 2006). The authors aim at facilitating an indepth discussion on these issues. The paper is wide in scope as it broadly covers the main issues relating to impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change in relation to Africa. The paper draws upon recent studies on vulnerability and adaptation, national communications and other reports, and extracts lessons from the studies which employed both a top-down scenario-driven approach, as well as those that adopted bottom-up approaches.</p>
