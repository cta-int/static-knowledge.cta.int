						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>In this article Julian M. Alston (UC Davis, USA) and Philip G. Pardey (University of Minnesota, USA) revisit the links between agricultural research and development (R&amp;D) and its consequences for nutrition and health outcomes of the poor in the context of two twenty-first century conundrums. First, while many of the world’s poor remain undernourished, paradoxically, growing numbers of people from a very broad range of income and social strata are overweight or obese. Second, rates of investment in agricultural research are slowing in many countries in spite of continuing high social rates of return to the investments, a trend toward higher food prices, and slowing rates of farm productivity growth in many countries.&nbsp; In this article, the authors provide answers to the following questions: To what extent is the agricultural abundance (enabled by public R&amp;D policy and investment) responsible for the rise of obesity?&nbsp; What is the nature of the trade-offs between health and nutrition problems arising from increasing food abundance versus health and nutrition problems arising from food scarcity?&nbsp; Should societies use agricultural R&amp;D as an instrument of public health policy or other dimensions of social policy? The authors conclude that in the political reality of agricultural science funding, it will continue to be better to accept funding conditional on it being used for a particular – lower payoff – purpose if the alternative is to have an even worse problem of underinvestment in the total portfolio. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://purl.umn.edu/162413" target="_self">http://purl.umn.edu/162413</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(AgEcon Search, 07/01/2014)</p>

					<p>In this report Peter McCornick and his team at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) synthesize years of IWMI research. They argue that while the exact impact of climate change on water resources requires ongoing research, the development of more resilient food production systems based on smarter water use is the most robust response. They detail a range of options for governments and communities to 'future-proof' food production, which, if combined, could significantly improve the use of water in agriculture. These range from small-scale methods for storing rainwater on-farm and using it more efficiently to large infrastructure investments, such as dam and reservoir construction. Underground water storage to capture floodwater is highlighted as one promising new avenue of research. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ecoticias.us/new/smart-water-management-can-help-avert-climate-induced-food-shortages_608" target="_self">http://www.ecoticias.us/new/smart-water-management-can-help-avert-climate-induced-food-shortages_608</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://goo.gl/M8vRp5" target="_self">http://goo.gl/M8vRp5</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(Ecoticias, 15/11/2013) &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

					<p>This synthesis report is based on the 2013 findings of Monitoring African Food and Agricultural Policies (<a href="http://www.fao.org/mafap/home/en/" target="_self">MAFAP</a>) programme conducted by the FAO to provide policy-makers in governments and civil society in Africa with the best possible information on the effects of policies and public expenditure. The findings show that: the policy environment and performance of domestic markets depressed producer prices in the recent past; producer prices would improve significantly if inefficiencies in domestic value chains were eliminated; producers of imported commodities generally faced price disincentives due to market inefficiencies in domestic value chains (particularly the high cost of processing); and producers of commodities essential to food security faced the strongest price disincentives. The level of public expenditure in support of the food and agriculture sector has declined and the composition of expenditures has shifted; the agriculture sector remains penalized by poorly targeted policies and public spending, which are often inconsistent with national objectives. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3513e/i3513e.pdf" target="_self">http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3513e/i3513e.pdf</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(FAO, 19/12/2014)&nbsp;</p>

	In this new lead article, Don Peden, highlights key research findings from a project in the Nile River Basin and explains how the results can improve understanding of livestock water productivity (LWP), and build policy that takes into account this new knowledge. The results are drawn primarily from the CGIAR Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture and Challenge Program on Water and Food.&nbsp;LWP takes an interdisciplinary agro-ecosystems approach to achieve more effective, sustainable and productive use of agricultural water for animal production. It calls for better feed sourcing and management, adoption of best-bet animal production technology, and improved water conservation. LWP is a scale-dependent concept: the elements of the hydrological cycle are studied within a specific spatiotemporal window. It represents the ratio of the total value of goods and services derived from domestic animals to the amount of water depleted as a cost of livestock-keeping.According to Peden, there are basic LWP-enhancing strategies. These include, feed sourcing and management strategies that require the use of feeds with a low water cost of production such as using crop residues which need no additional water. Another is the use of water-conserving strategies which shift evaporation to transpiration, for example by reducing overgazing and improving pasture management. Strategically allocating spatial and temporal distributions of livestock, drinking water and feed resources whichÂ&nbsp;also allow for sustainability in animal production, should also be considered.&nbsp;&nbsp;Achieving LWP requires a better understanding of the local situation, and access to and an appropriate mix of technology, training and education, community participation, investment, marketing opportunities and coherent governance.</p>

	There is need to improve the reproductive potential of dairy cattle owned by small-holder farmers as well as enhance earning potential. According to Paterson, the challenge for improving small-holder dairy production under communal systems is clear; introduce dairy genetics and supply the quantity and quality of feed to improve reproductive and yield potential.&nbsp;The norm for smallholder livestock herders in Africa is that the stocking density on the grassland reaches a level 300% higher than that of commercial farmers. At this high stocking rate, a balance is reached at which the number of calves born equals the mortality rate plus an off-take of 7%. The conception rate is about 30% and only 1-2% is marketed for cash. In contrast, the annual conception rate for commercial farmers is 90% and the off-take is 30% or higher, all of which is marketed. Using artificial insemination (AI) under a communal and free grazing system is expensive. In Ethiopia, a large trial is in progress using synchronisation of oestrus to bring many of the smallholder cows together to be inseminated by a team led by a veterinarian, making it economically feasible to inseminate 200 cows on one day.&nbsp;The choice of breeds is also critical. The indigenous cattle, e.g. the East African Zebu, are not milking breeds (such as Holstein and Jersey). They are small, weigh on average 300 kg at maturity and produce 6 litres of milk per day; 4 litres for the calf, and the rest for home consumption or sale. This small cow with low milk production and maintenance requirements, is a result of natural selection, which ensures its survival, especially under adverse conditions. The Holstein produces more milk but requires a maize based diet while, the Jersey produces less milk and on grassland. Patterson believes that the Jersey is the ideal breed to crossbreed with indigenous cattle in Africa as the purebred dairy cattle are unlikely to survive under communal systems.&nbsp;Given the high demand for milk, meeting this demand will require the use of locally adapted dairy cattle breeds and a well thought-out feeding strategy. Also necessary is a dedicated scientific community, effective extension support systems, an enabling policy environment and smallholder farmers who have the required entrepreneurial spirit.Read the article below and find the synthesis report <a href="/en/Dossiers/Commodities/Livestock/Feature-articles/Utilising-indigenous-breeds-Improving-the-reproductive-potential-of-smallholder-dairy-herds-synthesis" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

	Irrigation is responsible for about 70-80% of freshwater depletion in most developing countries. According to Lankford's article, worldwide, agriculture evapotranspires approximately 20-25 km3 of water per day and the 270-300 million hectare irrigated component of this evaporates about 6-9 km3 of water per day. Rain fed cropping consumes soil water and the range of measures available to manage soil water depletion is limited compared to that for irrigated cropping. As such, agricultural productivity can be boosted by using water more efficiently. Irrigation is believed to 'waste' significant amounts of water; worldwide, irrigation is about 40% efficient. It appears that effective efficiency can be increased by 10-20% (and more) by adopting new technologies or adapting existing practices from water-short farmers. A multi-pronged systems approach is recommended for delivering substantial and verifiable reductions in water consumption over large areas of irrigated lands.&nbsp;Lankford explains that improving irrigation performance involves simultaneous consideration of technological, social and economic points of view. The aim is to achieve this at a reasonable cost using technologies and ideas appropriate for, or already practiced by, irrigators with support from external engineers. Key dimensions of a broader approach include; (a) understanding the need for diverse solutions and assessing diversity and spectrum of irrigation types; (b) mixing and merging local and expert knowledge; (c) capping withdrawals and agreeing the purpose and destination that 'saved' water volumes are reserved for; and (d) comprehensively measuring water use efficiency and monitoring water flows.</p>

	This study provides data and analysis on the two most important factors influencing reproductive rate in cattle – nutrition and breed type – in the context of smallholder dairy herds in Africa. Paterson’s report is an assessment of the options available to small farmers. It provides an overview of pertinent and published research, and also specific insight into the efforts scientists from ILRI and national research centres are making in South Africa, Swaziland, Ethiopia and Kenya. The focus is on enhancing the earning potential of the smallholder dairy farmers.&nbsp;Regarding animal nutrition, profits rise with the use of indigenous products and losses come from using imported feed. It is therefore important to maximise the use of existing arable land, crop residue, leguminous forage, low quality roughages and protein supplements. To provide milk off-season – which sells at a higher price – farmers must develop a viable all year round feeding strategy and plan for quality crop residues when and where possible. Low productivity from tropical feedstuffs may well ask for the supplementation of high bypass proteins to balance the protein-to- energy ratio in these feeds, an exacting but necessary option for smallholders who’d like to sell milk all year.Dairy genetics is also crucial to the success of the smaller dairy businesses. The evolution of cows on the continent resulted in a relatively small animal adapted to hot climate and nutritional stress. The local African breeds require an infusion of dairy genetics to improve their milking potential: this has been successfully achieved through artificial insemination (AI) in many countries, and recently AI was combined with synchronisation of oestrus (sexual receptivity) in Ethiopia. Introducing genes associated with milk productivity could produce animals unadapted to the environmental constraints. Nevertheless the introduction of desirable milk genetics through the smaller New Zealand Jersey breed (which produces milk off grass) appears to be a better choice than the Holstein (which produces excessive quantities of milk off concentrate). A key recommendation for further consideration is the use of semen from Jersey crosses rather than from the Holsteins standing at the AI stations. However, there is still a need for specific studies on genotype x nutrition x disease interactions when developing new cattle breeds for the continent.&nbsp;There is high demand for milk and meeting this demand will require the use locally adapted dairy cattle breeds and a well thought-out feeding strategy. Also necessary is a dedicated scientific community, effective extension support systems, an enabling policy environment and smallholder farmers who have the required entrepreneurial spirit. &nbsp;Read the synthesis report below and find the article <a href="/en/Dossiers/Commodities/Livestock/Feature-articles/Utilising-indigenous-breeds-Improving-the-reproductive-potential-of-smallholder-dairy-herds-article" target="_self">here</a>.</p>

					<p>The Future Earth&nbsp;Transition Team, representing a wide range of disciplines and countries, and the main partners of the Science and Technology Alliance for Global Sustainability, released the Future Earth Initial Design Report early December 2013, at the International Council for Science (ICSU). The report sets out the initial design of <a href="http://www.futureearth.info/" target="_self">Future Earth</a>, a 10-year international research programme launched in June 2012, at the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), comprising a research framework and governance structure; preliminary reflections on communication and engagement, capacity-building and education strategies; and implementation guidelines. The research agenda is structured around three central themes: dynamic planet, global development, and transformations towards sustainability. The report details the key research questions that will be addressed in each area. In the agricultural sub-sector, regarding the issue of climate change for example, important gaps in geographic and temporal observations, understanding of system processes, and confidence in observations and projections must be tackled by better and more coordinated research.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.icsu.org/news-centre/news/top-news/final-report-of-the-future-earth-transition-team-published" target="_self">http://www.icsu.org/news-centre/news/top-news/final-report-of-the-future-earth-transition-team-published</a>(ICSU, 04/11/2013)</p>

					<p>Led by the Sackler Institute for Nutrition Science at the New York Academy of Sciences, more than 50 nutrition experts from six continents, along with leading NGOs/IGOs, universities, and the World Health Organisation, collaborated for two years to produce the report ‘A Global Research Agenda for Nutrition Science’. In order to develop innovative interventions to the challenges of nutrition science, the agenda has identified research gaps in three focus areas: 1) Environmental and Societal Trends Affecting Food and Nutrition Among Vulnerable Groups, 2) Unresolved Issues of Nutrition in the Lifecycle, and 3) Delivery of Intervention and Operational Gaps.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://goo.gl/kJnV9S" target="_self">http://goo.gl/kJnV9S</a>(NYAS, 19/09/2013)</p>

					<p>‘Climate Change and Agriculture in Jamaica’ is a report by the Investment Centre Division (TCI) of the FAO and discusses options for improvements to current policy on climate change and agriculture in Jamaica. It presents current information on the vulnerability of agro-ecosystems and food production systems, past trends in climate, and impacts of climate variability on sub-sectors such as fisheries, crop suitability, water resources and erosion. The discussion addresses broader policy directions, technical alternatives and investment priorities in relation to climate change adaptation. Examples of innovative agricultural practices and policy (such as: strengthening of Research &amp; Development links; development of agriculture weather risk management; use of traditional and local knowledge to speed up adaptation planning; strengthening of data collection, monitoring and forecasting) are presented as coping strategies, along a detailed list of ongoing and completed projects/initiatives related to climate change and agriculture in Jamaica.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3417e/i3417e.pdf" target="_self">http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3417e/i3417e.pdf</a>(FAO, 09/2013)</p>

					<p>A vast study by Mario Herrero and colleagues at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), shows that animals in many parts of the developing world require far more food to produce a kilo of protein than animals in wealthy countries. It also shows that pork and poultry are being produced far more efficiently than milk and beef, and greenhouse gas emissions vary widely depending on the animal involved and the quality of its diet. The research is a comprehensive assessment assembled of what cows, sheep, pigs, poultry and other farm animals are eating in different parts of the world; how efficiently they convert that feed into milk, eggs and meat; and the amount of greenhouse gases they produce. The paper offers the most detailed portrait to date of ‘livestock ecosystems’ in different parts of the world and should provide a new foundation for addressing the sustainable development of livestock.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/12/13/1321844111.full.pdf" target="_self">http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/12/13/1321844111.full.pdf</a><a href="http://paepard.blogspot.nl/2014/01/livestock-sustainability-through.html" target="_self">http://paepard.blogspot.nl/2014/01/livestock-sustainability-through.html</a>(PNAS via PAEPARD, 16/12/2013)</p>

					<p>This guide, now translated into Bislama (one of the official languages of Vanuatu), provides practical advice on how to grow sandalwood, including site and host selection, spacing, weeding, disease management, pruning and harvesting. Sandalwood’s high value and small size make it unique among forestry trees in that it can be incorporated into smaller ornamental gardens as well as larger commercial plantings. This guide will help the people of Vanuatu and other Pacific island countries to participate in this lucrative rural industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://aciar.gov.au/publication/MN151a" target="_self">http://aciar.gov.au/publication/MN151a </a>(ACIAR, 19/12/2013)&nbsp;</p>

	Agricultural production is being impacted by changes in climate, ecology and the environment. At the same time, agricultural intensification, population growth, urbanisation and industrialisation also impact upon the ecology and environment. In this context, achieving ecological sustainability is often seen as a desirable goal. But what is ecological sustainability? The meaning appears to be different when viewed through the lenses of various experts e.g. environmentalists, sociologists or economists. Nevertheless it is essential to have a clear understanding of what is meant in a specific situation or context. This goal may be as elusive as the goal of “sustainable development” for which several, sometimes contradicting definitions exist, and for which consensus on how to attain it, still has not been reached.</p>

					<p>Researchers with InSTePP (International Science &amp; Technology Practice &amp; Policy) at the University of Minnesota have compiled a comprehensive database of rate of return (RR) estimates from the worldwide literature on food and agricultural R&amp;D. They found that the wide dispersion in the reported RR makes it difficult to discern meaningful patterns in the evidence. Nonetheless, RR values based on the internal rate of return (IRR) were high regardless of the type of research, commodity focus, performer, or time period of the research. The authors question whether this IRR evidence should be taken at face value: they show that high IRR values and their implausible implications are the result flawed assumptions used in calculations. They suggest alternatives that utilise more appropriate assumptions and yield more sensible implications. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://harvestchoice.org/publications/returns-food-and-agricultural-rd-investments-worldwide-1958-2011" target="_self">http://harvestchoice.org/publications/returns-food-and-agricultural-rd-investments-worldwide-1958-2011</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(HarvestChoice, 10/2013)</p>

					<p>This ASTI report by IFPRI presents econometric data on total public agricultural R&amp;D spending in Asia–Pacific and related agricultural research indicators over the period ranging from 1996 to 2008. The only ACP country included in the sample is Papua New Guinea, where public agricultural R&amp;D spending decreased by almost half over the study period (so too did the share of AgGDP spent on R&amp;D). Nevertheless, more researchers have been hired by National Agricultural Research Institute (NARI), and in 2010, more women researchers worked there than in 2002 (though the absolute share of women scientists decreased). Almost 30% of PNG’s agricultural scientists employed in the public sector are aged 31 or under. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.asti.cgiar.org/publications/asia-pacific-regional-synthesis" target="_self">http://www.asti.cgiar.org/publications/asia-pacific-regional-synthesis</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(ASTI IFPRI, 07/2013)</p>

					<p>A new report, ‘The social, economic and environmental value of agricultural productivity in the European Union’, has been published by the Humboldt Forum for Food and Agriculture in Germany. The study assesses data on the economic, social and environmental effects of productive agriculture (which uses modern technologies such as agricultural machinery, new seed varieties, organic and/or mineral fertilizers, and plant protection products and solutions) in the EU. According to the findings, each percentage point increase in agricultural productivity in the EU: feeds more than 10 million humans per year; increases the annual social welfare generated in European agriculture by approximately 500 million; contributes €500 to the annual income of an average EU farmer; reduces net virtual land imports by about 1.2 million hectares; acts to save 220 million tons in CO2 emissions; preserves global biodiversity equivalent to fauna and flora of up to 600,000 hectares of rainforest. Switching to low input agricultural methods, with average 31 % lower yields than productive agriculture in the EU, would come at the cost of these benefits, according to the report's authors. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.farming.co.uk/news/article/9137" target="_self">http://www.farming.co.uk/news/article/9137</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(Farming Online UK, 04/11/2013)</p>

					<p>This INASP paper exposes the need to ensure that policy makers are able to demand and use research evidence. They argue that while many capacity building programmes improved skills for communicating research information, there is no actual investigation into the actual capacity to access, evaluate and use research evidence. Promoting evidence-informed policy relies not only on supporting the ‘supply’ of research evidence but also the ‘demand’ from policy makers. The paper explores a number of methodologies for evaluating capacity to access and use research information. For example, in Uganda, experts were commissioned to review the use of evidence in policy documents produced for the Ugandan parliament. The findings (<a href="http://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/executive%20summary.pdf" target="_self">available here</a>) show that a low level of STI literacy among MPs undermines the widespread willingness to improve the Ugandan government’s handling of STI. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.inasp.info/en/publications/details/114/" target="_self">http://www.inasp.info/en/publications/details/114/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(INASP, 07/2013)</p>
