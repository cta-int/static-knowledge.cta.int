						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Improving agricultural productivity is vital for poor rural households in Uganda to meet their food security needs and to promote sustained increases in income. Inorganic fertilizer can be a powerful productivity enhancing input. While Uganda has one of the highest soil nutrient depletion rates in the world, it has one of the lowest rates of annual inorganic fertilizer application – only 1.8 kg per hectare. The World Bank calculated that the value of replacing these depleted soil nutrients could be 20 percent of average rural Ugandan household income. Promoting fertilizer use is therefore crucial to sustainably increase agricultural productivity in Uganda. This brief explores the economics of fertilizer use by smallholder farmers in Uganda, the determinants of fertilizer use, and options for government action.Author: Namaazi, J. IFPRI brief, 2009</p>

					<p>This report reviews current knowledge of the effects of climate change on hunger. It summarizes knowledge from global studies completed and provides an overview of actions that can be taken to address the challenge. The authors believe that unless climate change is mitigated by substantial reductions of greenhouse gases it will greatly increase hunger, especially in the poorest parts of the world. The scale of risk from climate change varies with assumptions about future development, especially future levels of poverty, but it is likely to affect tens to hundreds of millions of people. It is expected that Africa will be most affected, especially the semi-arid regions north and south of the equator. This is mainly because of projected increases in aridity resulting from climate change and because of high vulnerability consequent on low levels of income. The poorest parts of southern and south-eastern Asia are likely to be substantially affected, with strong negative impacts on agricultural production. Food production in other regions, for example Central America, may also be impacted.Authors: Parry, M.. Evans, A., Rosegrant, M. and Wheeler, T. WFP</p>

					<p>An overview of the current scientific knowledge available on climate change implications for fisheries and aquaculture is provided in this publication through three technical papers that were presented and discussed during the expert workshop on Climate Change Implications for Fisheries and Aquaculture. A summary of the workshop outcomes as well as key messages on impacts of climate change on aquatic ecosystems and on fisheries- and aquaculture-based livelihoods are provided in the introduction of this technical paper. The first paper reviews the physical and ecological impacts of climate change relevant to marine and inland capture fisheries and aquaculture, the second paper tackles the consequences of climate change impacts on fisheries and their dependent communities and the third paper addresses the impacts of climate change on aquaculture.Editors: Chochrane, K., De Young, C., Soto, D., Bahri, T.

					<p>Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and enhancing forest carbon stocks in developing countries (REDD+) started as a global initiative. Much of the initial debate has focussed on the global REDD+ architecture and how REDD+ can be included in a post-2012 climate agreement. But the debates and the focus of actions have now increasingly moved to national and local levels. More than 40 countries are developing national REDD+ strategies and policies, and hundreds of REDD+ projects have been initiated across the tropics. This book wants to inform these national and local processes, by asking some basic questions: How are participating countries going to reduce emissions and increase carbon stocks that they hope to be paid for through global mechanisms? What new institutions, processes, policies, and projects are needed? What are the options in these areas, and how do they compare?Editors: Angelsen, A., Brockhaus, M., Kanninen, M., Sills, E., Sunderlin, W.D., Wertz-Kanounnikoff, S., Abdel Nour, H.O. CIFOR, 2009.</p>

					<p>This volume provides a comprehensive, up-to-date account of how the physical and biological environment of the Antarctic continent and Southern Ocean has changed from Deep Time until the present day. It also considers how the Antarctic environment may change over the next century in a world where greenhouse gas concentrations are much higher than occurred over the last few centuries. The Antarctic is a highly coupled system with non-linear interactions between the atmosphere, ocean, ice and biota, along with complex links to the rest of the Earth system. In preparing this volume our approach has been highly cross-disciplinary, with the goal of reflecting the importance of the continent in global issues, such as sea level rise, the separation of natural climate variability from anthropogenic influences, food stocks, biodiversity and carbon uptake by the ocean. One hundred experts in Antarctic science have contributed and drafts of the manuscript were reviewed by over 200 scientists.Authors: J. Turner et. al.

	Urban farming systems are in constant development as urban farmers adapt their existing practices or come up with new ones, yet are rarely given formal support for their innovations. This issue of looks at how urban farmers can be supported in their efforts to improve their livelihoods. The issue is a collaborative effort of the RUAF, the Prolinnova (Promoting Local Innovation) network and Urban Harvest, an initiative of CGIAR and draws on experiences of urban farming from around the world. Some articles merely promote innovations, while others discuss ways to stimulate the innovation capacity of the farmers themselves. Titles include the following: Promoting Local Innovation in Rural Agriculture: experience and lessons for urban settings ; Innovative Wastewater Recycling in an Indian Village: linking the rural with the urban ; Innovations in Greenhouse Rainwater Harvesting system in Beijing, China ; Cleaning, Greening and Feeding Cities: Local initiatives in recycling waste in Kampala, Uganda ; Urban Agriculture in Msunduzi Municipality, South Africa ; Innovations in Producer-Market Linkages: Urban field schools and organic markets in Lima ; Urban Agriculture as Social Justice Change Agent and Economic Engine ; Innovations in Urban Livestock Keeping in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.Author: R. van Veenhuizen (ed.), RUAF Urban Agriculture Magazine No. 19, 2008</p>

	The world is increasingly turning its attention to the issue of water scarcity. Many countries face water scarcity as a fundamental challenge to their economic and social development; by 2030 over a third of the world population will be living in river basins that will have to cope with significant water stress, including many of the countries and regions that drive global economic growth. Across the globe, policy makers, civil society and the business sector are increasingly becoming aware of the challenge facing global water resources, and the need to carefully manage these resources. Progress has been limited, however, and overall too slow. One missing piece has been the lack of a rigorous analytical framework to facilitate decision-making and investment into the sector, particularly on measures of efficiency and water productivity. This report was developed to take a first step in providing greater clarity on the scale, costs and tradeoffs of solutions to water scarcity. It is the result of a year-long collaboration involving IFC, McKinsey &amp; Company, The Coca-Cola Company, Barilla, New Holland Agriculture, Nestlé, SABMiller plc, Standard Chartered Bank and Syngenta AG, and has relied on the input of over 300 specialists and public sector practitioners as well as the consistent guidance of a group of expert advisors.By: 2030 Water Resources Group, November 2009</p>

					<p>Often considered unrelated, this report, drawing on review papers and original research mostly published during the last 2-3 years, suggests that agriculture is severely affected by HIV and AIDS and that the state of agriculture significantly influences the spread of HIV. The report points out that few SSA countries have substantial analyses of the rural and agricultural situations in their Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs). Few countries have national policies that give high priority to agriculture and the link between agriculture and HIV and AIDS is therefore missed. Therefore one of the biggest and most dangerous risks for farmers in sub-Saharan Africa is HIV and AIDS. The report further states that alternative individual or family assets (e.g. cattle, land, agricultural implements) have been exhausted due to a result of AIDS in the family. HIV and AIDS pose a very heavy burden due to the costs for medicines, care and funerals, which are often paid at the expense of additional needs such as food or school fees. According to the report rural poverty is at the root of risky behavior (sexual services for food, cash or other resources), which can often lead to an HIV infection, hence the rate of HIV transmission can only be effectively reduced by reducing rural poverty.Author: S.W.

					<p>Farmers’ organisations (FOs) in sub-Saharan Africa play an increasing importance role in allowing farmers to access agricultural services. But are poorer and disadvantaged farmers always able to participate and gain equal access to these services? This paper explores these issues drawing on several case studies, and considers what steps could be taken to better facilitate social inclusion of disadvantaged groups or individuals in FOs to enhance their access to agricultural services. The authors note that there are significant risks that individual farmers and groups are being excluded from agricultural services, as well as many farmers who do not join farmers’ organisations. Sometimes this is because they are particularly poor or belong to vulnerable groups, such as female-headed households and widows, and in other cases because they are from a minority social or ethnic group, or disabled, such as HIV/AIDS-affected households. Drawing on case studies carried out in 2005 with farmers’ organisations in Benin, Rwanda and Tanzania, the paper offers a conceptual framework of issues relevant to an active social inclusion strategy.Authors: B.

					<p>The countries of Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) represent a wealth of natural resources; the world’s greatest agrobiodiversity; and immense economic, social, and environmental diversity. As an example, the region is home to Brazil—the world’s fifth-largest country in terms of both area and population—yet it also comprises numerous Caribbean island nations populated by fewer than 100,000 people. Nonetheless, LAC countries exhibit much ommonality, including significant urban populations, high ethnic diversity, and increasing inequality and poverty. Another shared factor is that many LAC countries have reformed or are in the process of reforming their economies through structural adjustment programs. Agriculture faces many challenges in LAC, especially in the context of development. Rising food prices are a growing policy concern for both low- and middle-income countries, and, whereas the region as a whole is a net food exporter, poor consumers suffer the negative impacts of food-price inflation on their incomes and thus on their health and nutrition. In addition, international value chains and supermarkets are transforming domestic food markets, thereby posing serious challenges to smallholders in their ability to remain competitive. As commercial agriculture expands, the agricultural labor market and rural nonfarm economy become vital if resulting productivity gains are to have a beneficial effect on rural poverty.Authors: G.-J.

					<p>Humanity has made enormous progress in the past 50 years toward eliminating hunger and malnutrition. Some five billion people--more than 80 percent of the world's population--have enough food to live healthy, productive lives. Agricultural development has contributed significantly to these gains, while also fostering economic growth and poverty reduction in some of the world's poorest countries. This book examines how policies, programs, and investments in pro-poor agricultural development have helped to substantially reduce hunger across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The 20 success stories presented here provide both lessons and inspiration for continued efforts to eradicate hunger and malnutrition among the one billion people still facing this scourge.Authors: D.J.

Reflection on methodological issues" alt="link">How to get innovation system work in agriculture and rural development? Reflection on methodological issues</a></h2>

	
					<p>Following paradigm shifts in 1980s that resulted from relentless efforts made by a few informed social scientists in the early 20th century, some lead international organizations, NGOs, and national research and extension organizations came to pronounce innovation system in agriculture and rural development. These are, in fact, results of decades of intellectual dialogues among scientists in general and social scientists in particular as to what methodological routes should be followed in pursuit of science and science for development. The majors taken in this regard received increasing importance with the realization that more than fifty years of development assistance, especially in the developing world, did not adequately curve down poverty and its multiple consequences, notably, environmental degradation. In spite of encouraging efforts underway the world over by different agencies to promote what is named as a sustainable development through people’s participation, achievements made so far seems to be far below the extent of responses required to cope up with multi-faceted challenges at hand. Moreover, there are still conceptual and methodological gaps that are adversely affecting the common intentions geared towards making a difference in poverty alleviation and reducing environmental degradation, among others. There is still substantial adherence to technology transfer while the intention is innovation system. For some, even using the term innovation seems to be a major shift in their approach. In my view, one of the major gaps in this respect is lack of shared understanding of methodological issues by scientists and development practitioners, both from social and natural sciences streams. This paper, therefore, attempts to shed some light on these issues and propose ways to get innovation system approach work better in agriculture and rural development.Author: T.

					<p>Experts here describe the findings from a two year Commonwealth Fisheries Programme of which this book is a product. They include the impact of the WTO and its negotiations over fishing subsidies; the effect of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea on fisheries management; the role of sustainability certification for consumers in protecting stocks; the significance of marine fisheries for protein intake and food security, especially in developing countries; management cooperation and the impact of traditional law on Pacific fisheries; the scale of IUU fishing, especially off the African coast, and the measures used to combat it; regional management in the Caribbean and the impact of climate change on Caribbean fisheries; the scope and value of marine protected areas, promoted by the World Summit on Sustainable Development, 2002; the scale of depletion, both worldwide and within the waters of Commonwealth states; the case for a rights-based management strategy; and the potential role of the Commonwealth of Nations. The editors and authors hope that this report, in demonstrating the wide-reaching importance and vulnerability of marine capture fisheries and the urgency of corrective measures, will stimulate the leaders of Commonwealth governments, who meet in Trinidad and Tobago in November 2009, to commit to further concerted and determined action.Authors: R.

					<p>This publication documents the findings of the second phase of the study, which was completed in May 2006. The aim of this phase was to accomplish a wider, continental, coverage of river/lake/ groundwater basins (for example building upon the first phase), and expanding the network of researchers. Regional groups of researchers addressed vulnerability issues for their respective regions (southern, eastern, central, western, and northern Africa and the Western Indian Ocean Island States) by assessing major river/lake/groundwater basins on the basis of natural (physiographic), anthropogenic (socio-economic) and management criteria.By: UNEP, African Minister’s Council on Water, 2008</p>

					<p>The impact of recurrent drought-related crises in the Horn of Africa is rapidly escalating, with more and more people being affected each time a drought occurs. The current ability of pastoralists to respond to drought is limited not only due to the increasing frequency of drought, but also due to increasing population, a dwindling resource base, conflict, changes in access to land and water, as well as the impact of other shocks such as flooding and disease outbreaks. This briefing paper explores the responses to the 2005–2006 drought in Kenya’s ASALs, focusing particularly on the extent to which livelihoods interventions were implemented among pastoral populations. It is based on research that analyses the contextual factors (for example practices, capacities, structures, policies and rationale) that influenced the actions taken in the 2005–2006 drought response, and identifies the mechanisms, systems, functions and institutions that need to be strengthened to allow for more timely and appropriate livelihood responses in future.Authors: C. Longley &amp; M. Wekesa, ODI, October 2009</p>
