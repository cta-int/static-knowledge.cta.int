They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Lyndon D. Estes of Princeton University, USA, and colleagues have used a new bias-corrected meteorological dataset to analyze changes in precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and water availability in 20 African countries between 1979 and 2010, and the factors driving changes. With this dataset, they have filled a gap in understanding how global climate change is impacting African agriculture. The found that maize-growing areas in Southern Africa, particularly South Africa, benefitted from increased water availability due in large part to falling demand driven primarily by declining net radiation, increasing vapour pressure and falling temperatures (with no effect from changing wind speed), with smaller increases in supply. The Sahelian countries and Ethiopia experienced strong increases in water availability driven primarily by increased rainfall, with little change or small reductions in demand. However, intra-seasonal variability of water supply increased in West and East Africa. Only a small number of countries, mostly in or near East Africa, experienced declines in water availability due to decreased rainfall, but exacerbated by increasing demand. Much of the reduced water availability in East Africa occurred during the more sensitive middle part of the maize-growing season, suggesting negative &nbsp; &nbsp;consequences for maize production. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/9/7/075005" target="_self">http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/9/7/075005</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;See also Princeton Journal Watch, Molly Sharlach’s blog, of 21/07/2014 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Using an advanced form of X-ray imaging, researchers from the University of Nottingham, in collaboration with several international research groups, discovered that the presence of even small amounts of water can influence the structure of plant roots in soil. The degree of root branching determines the efficiency of water uptake and acquisition of nutrients by plants. Any new understanding of the regulation of root branching is of vital importance, and this finding could open up new ways of improving the water and nutrient foraging qualities of important food crops and hence could significantly improve crop yields. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(University of Nottingham website, 3/06/2014)</p>

					<p>In a development that could revolutionize the management of precious groundwater around the world, Stanford researchers Jessica Reeves, Rosemary Knight, Howard Zebker and Peter Kitanidis have pioneered the use of satellites to accurately measure levels of water stored hundreds of feet below ground. Their findings were published recently in <i>Water Resources Research</i>. Until now, the only way a water manager could gather data about the state of water tables in a watershed was to drill monitoring wells. In their novel approach, the scientists used Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to monitor changes in the elevation of Earth's surface. With this technology they could measure groundwater levels across vast areas without using lots of on-the-ground monitors. InSAR data could play a vital role in measuring seasonal changes in groundwater supply and help determine levels for sustainable water use. &nbsp;&nbsp;(Stanford University, 17/06/2014)</p>

					<p>Working with national partners in Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia, WorldFish, the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and the University of Osnabruck (Germany) have released the results of an analysis of climate change adaptation in food production in the Chinyanja Triangle in southern Africa. The project has identified a number of shifts in agricultural practices in response to climate-related changes. As weather becomes less predictable, local communities have embraced fish farming and small-scale irrigation. In response to reduced rainfall, farmers are increasing water storage and do not drain their ponds for longer periods of time. Communities endowed with a surplus of land have also begun to trade with communities with more water resources. While these changes have helped mitigate some of the effects of climate change, the researchers found that increases in irrigation and aquaculture are straining local water supplies. The project recommends that farmers plant trees along the rivers to increase shade cover, decrease evaporation, and reduce erosion. Other best practices include: distancing crops from the streams' banks to decrease siltation; creating ridges to slow run-off; and planting crops earlier to make use of residual moisture. &nbsp; &nbsp;(<a href="http://land-l.iisd.org/news/worldfish-iwmi-release-research-on-agricultural-water-use-and-adaptation-in-africa/" target="_self">IISD</a>, 04/2014) &nbsp;</p>

					<p>According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), 47% of the population could be living under severe water stress by 2050. Modern irrigation practices, including centre pivot irrigation systems, can help improve crop productivity and yields. However, irrigation is also the source of excessive water depletion from aquifers, erosion, and soil degradation. More farmers are using innovative practices to utilize water more efficiently and in lesser quantities to produce more nutritious foods. Using rainwater harvesting, zai pits (a traditional land rehabilitation technology invented by farmers in Burkina Faso), micro-irrigation, bottle irrigation, gravity drip buckets, rotational grazing systems, and other water-saving practices can all help maintain or create sustainable agricultural landscapes. Consumers too can profoundly reduce water waste and consumption, through the food choices they make each day. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://foodtank.com/news/2014/03/more-crop-per-drop" target="_self">http://foodtank.com/news/2014/03/more-crop-per-drop</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(Food Tank, 19/03/2014)</p>

					<p>A team of agronomists, entomologists, agro-ecologists, horticulturists and bio-geochemists from the Pennsylvania State University's College of Agricultural Sciences, led by Meagan Schipanski, has been developing a framework for considering a suite of ecosystem services that could be derived from agricultural land. The team quantified the benefits offered by cover crops across more than 10 ecosystem services. Benefits included increased carbon and nitrogen in soils, erosion prevention, more mycorrhizal colonisation – beneficial soil fungus that helps plants absorb nutrients – and weed suppression. By integrating a suite of ecosystem services into a unified analytical framework, the researchers highlighted the potential for cover crops to influence a wide array of ecosystem services. They estimated that cover crops increased eight of 11 ecosystem services. In addition, they demonstrated the importance of considering temporal dynamics when assessing management system effects on ecosystem services. &nbsp;Editor’s note: Cover cropping has been practiced by smallholder farmers in developing countries for several years. This research confirms the reasoning for maintaining this practice. &nbsp;<a href="http://news.psu.edu/story/308073/2014/03/18/research/research-reveals-true-value-cover-crops-farmers-environment" target="_self">http://news.psu.edu/story/308073/2014/03/18/research/research-reveals-true-value-cover-crops-farmers-environment</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Pennsylvania State University, 18/03/2014)</p>

					<p>IFAD and the Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security Organisation (CCAFS) commissioned two studies with the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD) to identify supporting and hindering factors for the adoption of conservation agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa. The first reviewed the effects of conservation agriculture on crop yields, identifying the agro-ecological and management conditions that favour positive crop responses. The second study, explored the merits of an assessment tool to predict the likelihood of conservation agriculture adoption in a given project region. &nbsp;&nbsp;The key findings from the first study proved that the combination of the three main principles of conservation agriculture are not, in many situations, an option. For instance, no-tillage has to be associated with mulching to result in higher crop yield. Additionally, crop rotation has to be an integral component with farmers moving from continuous mono-cropping systems to the inclusion of different crop types and preferably vegetables. These two factors are, for many smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, the bottlenecks to adoption. Crop residues have several other competing uses on the farm, in particular as feed for livestock. &nbsp; &nbsp;The second study explored the degree of accuracy of the qualitative expert assessment tool for conservation agriculture adoption (QAToCA). It discovered that the QAToCA tool can help in identification of the socio-ecological niches (e.g. preferences, prices, production objectives etc.) and specific sites for successful promotion of diverse CA practices and technologies. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://ifad-un.blogspot.nl/2014/03/conservation-agriculture-factors-for.html" target="_self">http://ifad-un.blogspot.nl/2014/03/conservation-agriculture-factors-for.html</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(IFAD social reporting blog, 25/03/2014)</p>

					<p>In this study, Tom Gleeson (McGill University, Canada) and Yoshihide Wada (Utrecht University, The Netherlands) analyze and interpret groundwater stress across whole nations using multiple data sources for the first time. They focus on two nations with the highest national groundwater abstraction rates in the world, the United States and India, and use recently developed groundwater footprints and multiple datasets of groundwater recharge and withdrawal derived from hydrologic models and data synthesis. The results indicate that the uncertainty is generally greater between datasets than within datasets and that much of the uncertainty is due to recharge estimates. Assessment of groundwater stress consistently across a nation and assessment of uncertainty using multiple datasets are critical for the development of a science-based rationale for policy and management, especially with regard to where and to what extent to focus limited research and management resources. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/4/044010/article" target="_self">http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/4/044010/article</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Environmental Research Letters</i>, 16/10/2013) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>South Africa could soon have a cluster of up to seven cosmic-ray moisture probes installed in agricultural, forestry and remote areas. These probes use cosmic-ray neutrons to deliver up-to-date readings of the moisture content of soil. Soil moisture is inversely related to the neutrons in the air above the soil surface. State of the art equipment using infrared analysers and three dimensional sonic anemometers will be used to complement the soil water cosmic-ray probe footprint for studies on the effects of soil moisture dynamics on plant water and carbon exchange. The probes have the potential to provide hydro-meteorologists with new methods of evaluating surface soil water. The continuous data streams linked to the new Cosmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS) continental-scale network will be of relevance to hydro-meteorologists interested in land-atmosphere interactions, ecologists interested in the impact of soil water on ecological status and evolution, remote sensing scientists for soil moisture calibration and validation, surface-water and groundwater modellers, and agricultural scientists interested in understanding and predicting the relationship between soil moisture and crop yield. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://goo.gl/M6w7TA" target="_self">http://goo.gl/M6w7TA</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(Farmer's Weekly, 30/01/2014) &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.frontiersin.org/people/u/34309" target="_self">Louise H. Comas</a>, US Depart. of Agriculture, Colorado and colleagues in the USA have identified a number of root traits associated with maintaining plant productivity under drought. These include small fine root diameters, long specific root length, and root length density. Small xylem diameters in targeted seminal roots appear to save soil water deep in the soil profile for use during crop maturation and result in improved yields. Capacity for deep root growth and large xylem diameters in deep roots may also improve root acquisition of water when ample water at depth is available. The authors believe a better understanding of root functional traits and how traits are related to plant productivity under different drought conditions is needed. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpls.2013.00442/abstract" target="_self">http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpls.2013.00442/abstract</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>Front.

					<p>Scientists from CSIRO, Australia, trialled a new technique for applying herbicides to raised beds of furrow irrigated sugarcane by using a specially adapted shielded sprayer. The technique minimises the likelihood of herbicides such as diuron, atrazine, ametryn and hexazinone coming into contact with irrigation water. The conventional application of herbicides in furrow-irrigated sugarcane production is to broadcast spray across the whole field using boom sprayers. By using shielded sprayers, runoff of highly soluble herbicides showed a 90% reduction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.csiro.au/Portals/Media/Herbicide-runoff-reduced-to-Great-Barrier-Reef.aspx" target="_self">http://www.csiro.au/Portals/Media/Herbicide-runoff-reduced-to-Great-Barrier-Reef.aspx</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(CSIRO, 16/10/2013)&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Through the use of GIS, all types of enterprise data related to water could be integrated into a single, authoritative data structure in which relationships and patterns can be discerned. GIS offers a common platform for managing water resources; agencies with different mandates can use an integrated system of local to regional scale to assess water quality, monitor flooding grounds and water table levels, or analyse runoff and rainfall patterns in agricultural landscapes. &nbsp;

					<p>Changing climate, drought and urban expansion threaten the yield of Australia’s wheat. But changes in cropping methods could address reduced water resources and lead to a jump in yield. Facing low autumn rain, farmers conserved as much summer rain in the subsoil as they could. They did so by meticulously controlling weeds and by retaining the stubble of the previous year’s crop as surface mulch.(<a href="http://csironewsblog.com/2013/06/11/australias-farming-future-doing-more-with-less-water/" target="_blank">CSIRO</a>, 11/06/2013)</p>
