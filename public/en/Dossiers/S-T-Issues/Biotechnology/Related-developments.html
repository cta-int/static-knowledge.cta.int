They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Transgenic crops have recorded the fastest adoption rate of any crop technology in the last century. However, restrictive regulations undermine society’s ability to reap their benefits. In this paper, Calestous Juma and Katherine Gordon of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School of Government, USA, argue that although many transgenic crops are still in the early stage of adoption emerging trends show significant societal benefits through positive economic impacts, fostering food security and promoting environment sustainability. They conclude that transgenic technology leads to more efficient production methods as well as a reduction in loss, which in turn leads to lower food prices. To realize these potential benefits, it is important to view transgenic crops as one of the many sources of food security and to assess their benefits and risks on a case-by-case basis.

					<p>African Yam bean is an orphan highly nutritious crop that is undervalued by policy makers. Plant breeders at the Department of Agricultural Production of Makerere University, are breeding yam beans to develop palatable varieties that are free of poisonous substances and adapted to tall grass savannah agro- ecological zones. 31 new accessions have been included in the CGIAR's Potato Center (CIP) gene bank, and about 60 farmer varieties of yam beans are now maintained at CIP. Makerere University and NARO researchers are optimistic that the yam bean will contribute significantly to food security because it is rich in protein, carbohydrates, zinc and iron and also improves soil fertility. &nbsp;&nbsp;(FarmBizAfrica, 11/10/2014)</p>

					<p>The detailed knowledge of the variation in the cattle genome has been increased by several orders of magnitude by the creation of a global database containing data from the breeds Angus, Holstein, Jersey and Fleckvieh and the genomes of more than 1,200 animals. The first generation of the new data resource, which will be open access, consists of sequenced genomes for a number of bulls and are based on new sequencing techniques. The research was published in <i>Nature Genetics</i> and led by Hans D Daetwyler of the Department of Environment and Primary Industries, Australia. Scientists from other countries are encouraged to join the project, to ensure a continual inflow of data. Key ancestor bulls have daughters all around the world, so it is a considerable strength of the project that such data are connected into one database. &nbsp;&nbsp;(ScienceDaily, 03/10/2014)</p>

					<p>Unlike numerous studies that have looked for evidence of selection using only population genetic data, Feng-Hua Lv, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China, with an international team of researchers scanned the sheep genome for selection signals by integrating genetic and climatic data. They found that adaptations to local climates have shaped the spatial distribution of particular genetic variants and, thus, such loci are likely involved in sheep adaptation to environmental challenges. Further molecular and functional studies of candidate genes close to significant markers will help to elucidate the genetic architecture of climate-mediated adaptive traits in sheep and other farm animals. &nbsp;&nbsp;(École Polytechnique Fédérale du Lausanne, 01/08/2014)</p>

					<p><i>Nature</i>’s Natasha Gilberts argues that genetic engineering lags behind conventional breeding in a race to develop new drought-resistant maize varieties that can withstand drought and poor soils. She refers to the Drought Tolerant Maize for Africa (DTMA) project led by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) that since 2006, developed 153 new maize varieties that perform well under dry weather conditions. The Improved Maize for African Soils (IMAS) project - a collaboration between CIMMYT, the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute, the South African Agricultural Research Council, and the multinational corporation DuPont Pioneer has, since 2010, developed 21 conventionally bred varieties that in field tests yielded up to 1 t/ha more in nitrogen-poor soils than did commercially available varieties.

Using conventional genetic manipulations, the discovery will permit innovation in wheat variety development unhampered by the cost, regulatory hurdles and controversy of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

Agricultural biotechnology comprises several scientific techniques (genetic engineering, molecular marker-assisted breeding, the use of molecular diagnostics and vaccines, and tissue culture) that are used to improve plants, animals and microorganisms. However, in preparing this desktop analysis of peer-reviewed evidence and documented examples, IFPRI has focused on genetic modification (GM) technologies and on the agricultural contexts in which they are applied.

					<p>AGROCOS is a pioneering European project that is using modern scientific techniques to develop new products for the agrochemical and cosmetics industries. At the heart of the AGROCOS project are molecules extracted from 1800 plant species harvested in ‘biodiversity hotspots’ in Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. These compounds are tested for their anti-fungal, herbicidal or insecticidal qualities, and for their UV protection characteristics and anti-ageing properties. From the thousands of compounds extracted, the project hopes to identify the five most promising ones for developing new products. The project represents an important breakthrough for the technique of ‘bioprospecting’, or deriving materials from nature. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
