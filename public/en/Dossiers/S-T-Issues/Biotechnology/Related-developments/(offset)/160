						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Maize production in West and Central Africa is set to get a much-needed boost with the release of improved varieties by the Nigeria National Variety Release Committee. The improved varieties address many of the major constraints to maize production such as drought, low soil fertility, pests, diseases, and parasitic weeds. Researchers developed the varieties through conventional plant breeding by tapping naturally-available traits. The released maize include 13 open-pollinated varieties of extra-early-, early-, intermediate-, and late-maturity with resistance to the parasitic weed <i>Striga hermonthica </i>and stem borers, tolerance to drought, and with good adaptation to sub-optimal soil nitrogen. Four hybrids with drought-tolerance have also been released. (Source: ScienceDaily 15 February 2010)</p>

					<p>Tanzania is planning to go to court to stop the US and Brazilian governments from patenting a sorghum gene, together with two multinationals, isolated on Tanzanian farms. The strain of sorghum -- a staple food in the country -- has proven to be acid-aluminium tolerant. Tanzania explains that the patenting of this crop by the US or Brazil would be a fatal blow to its food security, and moreover it violates international treaties. It would also increase local food prices as multinational corporations seek to exploit their patent to boost profits by selling sorghum seeds at high prices at a time when millions of Tanzanians currently living under conditions of abject poverty are struggling to put food on their table.

					<p>Scientists and farmers are urging Ethiopia to reconsider a new biodiversity law they say restricts agricultural research and could hamper delivery of urgently needed food aid. The law has prompted foreign donors to cut off funding to Ethiopian scientific research institutions. Ethiopia's government held a two-day forum in the first week of February to hear objections to a Biodiversity Proclamation approved by parliament last July. The law's stated objective is to protect biodiversity, as well as human health and animals, from 'the adverse effects of modified organisms'. Critics say the proclamation chokes off research into improving crop production in a country suffering chronic food shortages. (Source VOA, 4 February 2010)&nbsp; </p>

					<p>Kenyan scientists are making desperate attempts to enhance nutritional value in sorghum, a cereal that is likely to replace maize — which continues to suffer effects of erratic climate — as the country’s staple food. “We know maize has more protein and is easily digestible but we want to make sorghum to be even better than maize,” said Dr Joel Mutisya, molecular biologist working on sorghum at Kenyan Agricultural Research Institute (KARI). According to the scientists, 70 per cent of Kenya is now unable to produce maize as former growing areas are turning into semi arid areas conducive for growing sorghum, a drought-resistant plant.

					<p>In this article, Jim Kaput explains why efforts to tackle malnutrition should consider nutrigenomics — the interplay between food and genetic make-up. Starving people do not just need food. They need the right nutrients to maintain and promote good health. Food aid can help prevent starvation but if it is not nutritionally balanced it could also contribute to chronic diseases and premature death. A person's genes determine how their body absorbs and uses nutrients. Because each person is genetically unique, the amounts and types of nutrients needed to maintain good health may differ among individuals. (Source: SciDev.net, Jim Kaput, 20 January 2010)</p>

The alliance brings together SG Biofuels' Genetic Resource Center, featuring the largest and most diverse library of Jatropha genetic material in the world, with the advanced biotechnology and synthetic biology tools of Life Technologies. The partnership will initially include sequencing the <i>Jatropha curcas</i> genome, allowing for the rapid introduction of new traits targeted toward increasing the yield of the oil-producing plant. <i>Jatropha curcas</i> is a non-edible shrub that is native to Central America. Its seeds contain high amounts of oil that can be used for a variety of bio-based materials including biodiesel and feedstock substitutes for the petrochemical and jet fuel industries. It can be effectively grown on marginal lands that are considered undesirable for other crops. (Source: African Agriculture, January 18 2010)</p>

					<p>A team of researchers from the United States has developed the first draft sequence of the soybean genome, an achievement that will help scientists gain a better understanding of one of the world's most important crops. Soybean is a major source of protein for food and animal feed: from tofu to soy flour, meat substitute and soy milk. It is also used to produce much of the world's cooking oil and as an important source for biodiesel. Like other legumes, the crop is also crucial for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen into the soil. &quot;This is a milestone for soybean research and promises to usher in a new era in soybean agronomic improvement,&quot; said co-author Gary Stacey. &quot;The genome provides a parts list of what it takes to make a soybean plant and, more importantly, helps to identify those genes that are essential for such important agronomic traits as protein and oil content.&quot; (Source: Nature, 14 January 2010).</p>

	Invasive species have, over the years, wrought havoc on both natural ecosystems and farming systems of the Pacific islands. Early attempts at biocontrol saw some successes, but these were overshadowed by a few spectacular failures: the Indian mongoose, widely imported to control rats, and the cane toad brought in to control cane beetles in the sugar cane fields of Fiji, have now earned their own places in the World Conservation Union's list of the world's 100 worst invasives. But biocontrol is entering a new era in the Pacific region. A more reliable science of biocontrol, and a renewed commitment to networking across the region to share expertise and best practice, mean that biocontrol can now take its place in helping restore equilibrium within the fragile ecosystems of the islands.

					<p>The fungus<i> Ascochyta rabiei</i> threatens chickpea crops the world over. But now this blight-causing pathogen could meet its match in <i>Aureobasidium pullulans,</i> a rival fungus that Agricultural Research Service scientists are investigating as a biocontrol agent. During the winter, <i>A. rabiei</i> survives on chickpea stubble (stems and leaves left behind after harvest) and forms sexual spores, called ascospores, which can infect plantings of the crop in the spring. Severe outbreaks, fueled by cool, wet conditions, can wipe out the entire crop. But for all the damage <i>A. rabiei</i> inflicts, it, too, can be harmed. In studies begun in 2003, a close examination of chickpea stubble from fields near Pullman, Washington, revealed a community of fungal competitors. Of 28 fungal isolates identified, <i>A. pullulans</i> scored highest on a ranking system used to assess their biocontrol potential. These criteria included ease of growth in culture, abundance in nature, safety to humans and animals, and “antagonism” towards targeted pathogens. (Source: ARS, December 4, 2009)</p>

The plan is to distribute the seeds to small farmers in Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda. Normally Monsanto’s patented seeds come at a high price, which has inspired an endless stream of vitriol from activists who accuse the company of exploiting poor farmers for obscene profits. This time, farmers will receive the seeds royalty free – indefinitely – as part of Gates’ push for a “green revolution” in Africa. GM seeds are not yet legally available in East Africa. Regulations for Kenya’s Bio-Safety Act are still being developed. Nonetheless, Monsanto has been testing GM cotton with KARI for three years already, and plans to launch trials for GM corn next year.

					<p>Scientists from the John Innes Centre in Norwich, UK and the University of Freiburg in Germany have uncovered a gene in plants that is responsible for controlling the size of seeds, which could lead to ways of improving crops to help ensure food security in the future. Increasing seed or grain size has been key in the domestication of the crops used in modern agriculture, and with a growing world population, further increasing the yield of crops is one goal of agricultural research. Michael Lenhard, funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), has identified a gene in the model plant Arabidopsis that determines overall seed size, and is now investigating how this could be used to for the improvement of crops. More work is now needed before this research can be applied to crop plants. One effect of increasing the seed size in the experimental plants was to decrease the total number of seeds produced, so there was no overall increase in yield. The scientists did notice an increase in the relative oil content of the larger seeds, so the effects of altering this gene in oil seed rape is currently being investigated.

	The genome of the cucumber has been sequenced by an international consortium lead by Chinese and U.S. institutions. The annotated genome was published online November 1st by the journal <i>Nature Genetics</i>. The cucumber genome will give insight into the genetics of the whole cucurbit family, which includes pumpkins and squash, melon and watermelon, and be a platform for research in plant biology, said William Lucas, professor and chair of the Department of Plant Biology at the University of California, Davis. Lucas helped with the development and management of the project. &quot;This is going to help a large community -- we can now go ten times faster than we could before,&quot; Lucas said. Lucas studies the vascular transport systems, phloem and xylem, that plants use to move nutrients, minerals and signalling molecules throughout the body of the plant. Pumpkins and cucumber are model plants for studying vascular transport, because their vascular system is large and easy to access. (Source: Daily Science, 3 November 2009)</p>

					<p>Media educators from ten journalism and mass communication institutions in the Eastern Africa region took part in a training workshop in November 2009 to help them better report on biotechnology and biofuels using radio as a case study. The training workshop was organized by ISAAA AfriCenter in collaboration with the School of Journalism and Mass Communications of the University of Nairobi with financial support from UNESCO. The training originated from the realization that building capacity of media educators on advanced radio interviewing skills and exposure to basic concepts on the subject would have a multiplier effect from training a larger pool of journalists. This would enhance regional capacity with potential to institutionalize specialized writing on biotechnology in journalism training curriculum. Mr. Hezekiel Dlamini, the UNESCO advisor for communication and information in East Africa, challenged the media and the scientists to find a common language of interaction in promoting factual, balanced and unbiased reporting of biotechnology. The Director of Extension and Training in Kenya's Ministry of Agriculture Mary Kamau emphasized the importance of mass media in creating awareness on biotechnology which she observed is very low in the region.

					<p>In order to seize emerging opportunities in the potato market across the globe, the Potato farmers Association of Nigeria (POFAN) said it is now ready to harness the abundant resources through partnership with Israel in the area of biotechnology. The Chairman of Grow Africa Group Dr. Ken Ife said that Nigeria is working with Israel to seek better ways of improving and preserving soil quality for greater yield. He said: “We are working with Israel on irrigation related matters and also on biotechnology. They are very advanced in biotechnological practices of improving soil fertility and very efficient in their use of water. He encouraged the farmers not to relent in their effort at making Nigeria great and in boosting exportation to other countries, saying that potato farmers and farmers in general hold the key to food security in Nigeria.
