						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	Seven West African universities have created a masters degree in tropical biotechnologies. The universities are Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar in Senegal; Abobo-Adjamey of Abidjan in Côte d'Ivoire; Abomey-Calavi of Cotonou in Benin; Abdou Moumouni of Niamey in Niger; Bamako in Mali; Nouakchott in Mauritania; and Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso. The countries are all members of the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS. The programme is to address the limited capacity of present human resources in this branch of agricultural research. The course will be given online to ensure quality and to make it accessible to all students in the region. From 2012 on, the masters will offer two specialisations, in plant biotechnology and in agricultural and environmental biotechnology.

	Papua New Guinea’s potato industry suffers from the potato late blight (PLB, <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>). The Sequoia, PNG’s most common potato variety, is highly susceptible to PLB. After a devastating outbreak in 2003, only commercial farmers who could afford fungicides, portable sprayers and potato seeds did continue to grow the crop. However, smallholders farmers on the islands could not afford to buy the standard remedial to the blight. Especially for the farmers living at higher altitude, potato was an important cash and subsistence crop. In May 2011, PNG’s National Agricultural Research Institute released two late blight resistant potato varieties, the product of a large-scale project that start started in 2003 with the assistance of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR). Blight resistant potato seeds are now distributed to farmers, who are also offered training on integrated late blight management for existing and new potato cultivars.

	A new report by ETC Group (Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration, based in Ottawa, Canada) reveals a dramatic upsurge in the number of patent claims on 'climate-ready' genes, plants and technologies that will supposedly allow biotech crops to tolerate drought and other environmental stresses (i.e. abiotic stresses) associated with climate change. The patent grab threatens to put a monopoly choke-hold on the world's biomass and future food supply, warns ETC Group. In many cases, a single patent or patent application claims ownership of engineered gene sequences that could be deployed in virtually all major crops - as well as the processed food and feed products derived from them.

	Biosciences East and Central Africa (BecA) is an initiative developed within the framework of Centres of Excellence for Science and Technology in Africa and is supported by the Government of Canada, International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency and other partners. Hosted and managed by the ILRI in Nairobi, Kenya, the BecA Hub provides a common biosciences research platform, research-related services and capacity building opportunities to the region and beyond. Applauding the establishment of the ultra-modern complex of laboratories, the Head of State of Kenya, President Kibaki, noted that “the facility would assist scientists in the region and the entire continent to undertake cutting edge research that would boost agricultural output and food security. This will go a long way in enhancing the ability of young Africans to undertake research with a view to address the chronic challenges that constrain the agricultural sector in sub-Saharan Africa.” The Hub aims to increase access to affordable, world-class research facilities and to create and strengthen human resources in biosciences and related disciplines in Africa.

	On 26 October 2010, the FAO launched the 2nd State of the World’s Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture report (SoWPGR-2). This report provides a comprehensive overview of recent trends in Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (PGRFA) conservation and use around the world. It is based on information gathered from more than 100 countries, as well as from regional and international research and support organizations and academic programmes. The report documents the current status of plant genetic resources diversity, conservation and use, as well as the extent and role of national, regional and international efforts that underpin the contributions of PGRFA to food security. It highlights the most significant changes that have occurred in the sector since 1996, when the first report was produced. The SoWPGR-2 provides the basis for the updating of the Global Plan of Action for the Conservation and Sustainable Utilization of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (GPA).

	The MAREX ('Exploring marine resources for bioactive compounds: from discovery to sustainable production and industrial applications') project has received EUR 6 million under the 'Food, agriculture and fisheries, and biotechnology' (KBBE) Theme of the EU's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) to collect, isolate and classify marine organisms, including sea anemones, tunicates and micro and macroalgae, from the Mediterranean, Baltic and Arabian Seas as well as the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Companies worldwide are working to identify and exploit various natural sources of compounds that could prove effective in drugs and other products. Joining this effort is an EU-funded team of scientists that is hunting for biologically active substances in marine organisms that could be suitable for use as a basis for pharmaceutical goods.

	Talks between member states of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) have produced a draft policy on GM technology, which was sent for national consultation early September 2010. It is a breakthrough to see a group of 19 African nations working to develop policies that should make it clear to all sides in the debate that Africa can make up its own mind. COMESA is a trade bloc, and its proposals aim to develop research and trade in GM crops, stating that decisions regarding GMOs should be based on sound science and evidence. The use of GM crops for food divides opinion, especially when it comes to Africa. Sharp views on the technology in the developed world, honed by more than a decade of arguments in Europe and elsewhere, are too easily projected onto Africa, with the continent portrayed as a passive participant in the global melodrama over GM food.

	Scientists at the Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics scientists have inserted a gene which modified rice to increase the number of salt-transporting proteins in specific cells in the rice root. This resulted in salt being trapped in the root where it is less harmful and avoiding its effect to the vulnerable upper part of the plant. Dr. Darren Plett, lead researcher of the study, says that the new GM technique is an ‘efficient and robust biotechnological approach’ to help rice grow in soils with high salinity. ‘Our results provide a new approach for genetic modification to increase the tolerance of crops to the toxic sodium ion (Na+), which is a major environmental stress. Work is now underway to transfer the technology to wheat and barley.

					<p>Aflasafe® is a win-win formula for African farmers and investors that uses otherwise harmless fungi to control those that produce deadly aflatoxins in maize and peanut. The biological control of aflatoxins using aflasafe has rekindled hopes of a brighter future for African farmers battling crop contamination even as it opened doors for the private sector looking to invest in a winning formula in the continent's agriculture sector. The aflasafe technology, which uses “good” fungus to fight the “bad” ones, has provided relief to hundreds of maize farmers in northern Nigeria, a region where more than 70% of the population depend on agriculture for at least part of their livelihood. According to Ranajit Bandyopadhyay, IITA (Ibadan, Nigeria) plant pathologist, and Irmgard Hoeschle-Zeledon, coordinator of the CGIAR's Systemwide Program on Integrated Pest Management, an initial investment of US$1-3 million in an aflasafe manufacturing plant is likely to reap investors about N20 million ($1.33 million) annually. Bandyopadhyay indicated that an investment in an aflasafe manufacturing plant in Nigeria would pay off considering the huge demand for quality maize in the country and its neighbours.

	Dr. Sheila Okoth, leading an interdisciplinary and farmer participatory project on Conservation and Sustainable Management of Belowground Biodiversity (CSM-BGBD) is in the process of finding a sustainable solution to fungal contamination and mycotoxin production in foods, including aflatoxins. Aflatoxins are toxic, carcinogenic by-products of fungi that colonise maize and groundnuts, among other crops. Okoth’s research findings revealed that African countries do not have cost-effective technologies that can be used to reduce the risk of human and animal exposure to aflatoxin contamination. IFPRI, Washington, USA, has also launched a research project to find cost-effective methods of handling aflatoxin contaminations. Currently attached to the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa on a fellowship sponsored by the African Women in Agricultural Research and Development program, Okoth is studying possibilities, in collaboration with the university’s Department of Plant Pathology, of developing aflatoxin-resistant maize lines. The project includes collaboration between five institutions in Kenya and 120 farmers in agro-ecological regions (Embu and Taita Districts, Kenya) demonstrating alternative methods of farm management.

	A collaborative team of scientists, led by researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin (USA) has made a <a href="http://www.nature.com/nsmb/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nsmb.1887.html" target="_blank">significant advance</a> on the discovery last year of pyrabactin (by Sean Cutler of the University of California, Riverside). Pyrabactin is a synthetic chemical that mimics a naturally produced stress hormone in plants to help them cope with drought conditions. Plants naturally produced a stress hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), in modest amounts to help them survive drought by inhibiting growth. ABA has already been commercialized for agricultural use. But it has at least two disadvantages: it is light-sensitive and costly to make. Pyrabactin, on the other hand, is relatively inexpensive, easy to make, and not sensitive to light. But its drawback is that, unlike ABA, it does not turn on all the ‘receptors’ in the plant that need to be activated for drought-tolerance to fully take hold. By understanding how pyrabactin works and with more research like the current one, the drawbacks of pyrabactin can be studied, and other more effective chemicals can be developed more readily for bringing drought-resistance to plants.

	Solomon Gelalcha, Director of Kulumsa Agricultural Research Center (KARC, Kulumsa, Ethiopia) one of the organizations under the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research said two new wheat varieties were developed by researchers at Kulumsa through a new approach called ‘Durable Rust Resistance in Wheat’ (DRRW). These new varieties are resistant to multiple current and possible future wheat killer pathogens of yellow, stem and leave wheat rusts. The DRRW approach focuses on giving the new wheat varieties durability against any wheat disease. The previous model gave varieties ‘vertical resistance’ to a single disease, and is easily defeated by new diseases or when the disease they are resistant to evolves. Kulumsa is attempting to release the new varieties of wheat before having them officially approved. (Source: ISP, 17 September 2010)</p>

	KA2-101, a specially bred cacao cultivar developed by the Cacao and Coconut Research Institute in Papua New Guinea is one of the parents breed used to map the cacao genome. On 15 September 2010, a first draft of the cacao genome has been completed by a consortium of academic, governmental, and industry scientists. Indiana University Bloomington scientists performed much of the sequencing work, which is described and detailed at <a href="http://www.cacaogenomedb.org/" target="_blank">the official website of the Cacao Genome Database</a> project.

	A new biosafety facility was opened at the College of Natural and Applied Science, University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania under the Danish Bilateral Programme for Enhancement of Research Capacity in Developing Countries (ENRECA) of the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA). During the opening, Dr. Hassan Mshinda, Director General of the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology (Costech), said that the genetic techniques to be used in the facility would enhance both the qualitative and quantitative traits of the crops. On the other hand, Bjarne Sørensen, Danish ambassador to Tanzania, expressed his hope for the improvement of agriculture through modern biotechnology: ‘We expect the facility to give students, academic staff and relevant person’s knowledge on genetically modified plants through specialist training as well as generating local knowledge on the subject.’ (Source: ISAAA taken from The Citizen (Newspaper, Tanzania), 2 September 2010)</p>

					<p>Burkina Faso has embarked on a program to create awareness on the National Biosafety Law. The law has been translated into the three most commonly spoken languages (Mooré, Jula and Gulmacema) in the cotton growing areas. The first phase of translation has been achieved and the National Biosafety Authority is planning to reach out to farmers with the documents and to train them on the existing provisions regarding the use and management of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the country. At the moment, 6000 translated copies (2000 per language) consisting of summaries of essential extracts of the Act have been printed and they will be distributed to farmers through extension services.

					<p>Tanzania is poised for a scientific revolution to defeat drought – if tests to fertilize maize seeds using biotechnology prove successful. A scientific conference in Johannesburg last week, organized by the 'Water Efficient Maize for Africa' (WEMA) regional project, revealed a rising enthusiasm among East and Southern African states to make this agricultural revolution. This may mean sustained growth in maize, Africa's staple food. According to Dr Alois Kullaya, a principal agricultural officer with the Tanzanian Ministry of Agriculture and country coordinator for the drought-tolerant maize production project in Tanzania, mock tests have already been carried out at Makutupora in the arid Dodoma region. This is in readiness for an imminent biotechnology test to develop drought-resistant maize seeds. (Source: All Africa, 2 May 2010)</p>
