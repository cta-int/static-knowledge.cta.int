They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	<p>One of the challenges confronting scientists worldwide is the development of new and sustainable ways of protecting crops from pests and diseases. Biotic stress, caused by plant pathogens, insect pests and weeds, accounts for some 30-40% of crop losses worldwide. The effects of these range from mild symptom development to major injuries and catastrophes in which large areas of planted food crops are destroyed. Annual losses from plant pathogens alone are estimated to be 12% (Cook, 2006). Controlling biotic stress and producing crops with special agronomic traits is therefore of paramount importance for reducing the threat to crop productivity, farmers’ net income, the food supply, and by extension, the economies of rural areas (Oerke, 2006). </p>

<p>
To combat losses caused by biotic stress, various crop husbandry techniques have been adopted, and the most widely used management strategy is the application of agrochemicals. However, chemical protection against bacterial pathogens has not evolved as quickly as that against fungi, and is not applicable to viruses. The intensive use of agrochemicals has led to the development of resistance in various pest and pathogen populations and in some cases the chemicals are no longer used because of their high toxicity to non-target species. Nowadays, the focus is on strategies that allow for crop production with minimal use of agrochemicals and the most effective strategy involves breeding resistant crop cultivars. However, there are many pathogens for which no effective sources of disease resistance have been identified. <br/>Genetic engineering or recombinant DNA technology, together with plant transformation and tissue culture techniques, has facilitated the development of transgenic plant cultivars with enhanced arthropod pest and disease resistance. In contrast to conventional breeding, which involves the random mixing of tens of thousands of genes present in both the resistant and susceptible plant, recombinant DNA technology allows the transfer of only the resistance gene to the susceptible plant and the preservation of valuable economic traits. Moreover, the genetic sources for disease resistance are not limited to closely related plant species (Lurquin, 2002). </p><p>
<b>Evolution of transgenic crops </b><br/>After fourteen years (1996 to 2009), some 134 million hectares worldwide are cultivated with transgenic crops. The most commonly grown cultivars contain enhanced herbicide tolerant and insect resistance traits (James, 2009). Although developed countries were the primary users of transgenic crops, developing countries (e.g. Argentina, Brazil, India, China and South Africa) now account for about 46% of the global transgenic crop area. Of these, farmers are mainly growing transgenic cotton, maize or soyabeans (James, 2009), which have been developed and made available by companies such as Monsanto and Syngenta. Seeds of insect-resistant cotton and maize (or Bt crops) were distributed by Monsanto to smallholders in South Africa between 1998 and 2002 (Bennett et al, 2004; Thirtle et al, 2003). Similarly, small-scale farmers are growing Monsanto’s insect-resistant cotton in China, India (Qayum &amp; Sakkhari, 2005) and Mexico, and transgenic herbicide-tolerant soyabean in Argentina (Qaim and Traxler, 2004) and Brazil.</p><p>Reports from these regions on the economic impact from the cultivation of transgenic crops are varied; each having benefited in different ways. In China, planting transgenic cotton cultivars has enabled reductions in chemical pesticide applications to cotton crops with important benefits for farmers’ health and for the environment. Moreover, lower costs of seeds, as a result of the availability of local transgenic cotton cultivars developed by Chinese researchers, and marginally higher yields (8-10%) have translated to increased net profits (compare net revenues of US$277 on Bt farms to -US$225 on non-Bt farms) (Pray et al., 2002). Insect-resistant transgenic cotton is widely and successfully employed in one region of Mexico but the cultivars have not proven effective against pest populations in other regions of Mexico and chemical pesticide applications continue to be widely used to safeguard cotton in these regions. Similarly, there are mixed results with transgenic cotton cultivars in India. In some regions (Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu), large net gains have been obtained, whereas the transgenic cultivars are of little or no value in other regions (such as Andhra Pradesh). The poor performance in the latter regions has been attributed to a lack of locally adapted cultivars (Qaim et al., 2006).</p><p>In Argentina, the well-established seed industry and an effective regulatory system have fostered the rapid adoption of transgenic crops, particularly herbicide-tolerant soyabean. A 10% increase in productivity has been documented and, along with lower seed prices has increased revenues (Qaim and Traxler, 2004). In contrast, insect-resistant cotton has offered marginal returns to Argentinean farmers, partly because of the high price of seeds. The latter is also reported in South Africa, where the main constraint to the adoption of transgenic maize lies in the ability of seed companies to provide seeds at affordable prices (Gouse et al, 2005). Although legal and judicial restraining orders have delayed deployment of transgenic crops in Brazil, increased adoption of herbicide-tolerant soyabean and insect-resistant cotton are anticipated. Taken together, there is evidence that farmers in some developing countries are benefitting from the cultivation of transgenic crops grown for commercial purposes, but certain prerequisites are necessary to ensure timely delivery and adoption, namely national research, extension and regulatory capacity, effective intellectual property rights management, and input systems, particularly for seeds at affordable prices. </p><p>
<b>Efforts to Harness Biotechnology in the </b><b>Caribbean</b><b> Countries</b><br/>While several countries have embraced transgenic crops, countries of the Caribbean region are yet to fully harness biotechnology. The agricultural landscape in the Caribbean has been dominated by the production of traditional export-oriented plantation crops, such as sugarcane, banana, coffee, tobacco, coconut and cocoa, mixed farming of non-traditional crops, livestock and fisheries. Export earnings from the production and sale of traditional crops in several countries have declined and the agricultural sector is focusing on diversification and reinvention through improved utilization of science and technology. Cuba has a well-developed biotechnology sector, with thrusts into agro-biotechnology research and development including biopesticides and biofertilizers. Jamaica and the Dominican Republic have developed supporting policies for agro-biotechnology development and have put some institutional mechanisms in place to support the development of transgenic products. The University of the West Indies, St. Augustine and Mona Campuses, in Trinidad and Jamaica, respectively, have biotechnology programmes which integrate research on non-traditional horticultural commodities, including new ornamental plant varieties and natural products from medicinal plants. At the regional level, CARICOM has focussed efforts on the development of a regional Biotechnology and Biosafety Policy and Strategy framework for cooperation and collaboration in biotechnology and biosafety, which is yet to to be adopted. In 2008, Caribbean Community (CARICOM) ministers endorsed a policy framework on Science, Technology and Innovation that will guide regional planning and development (CCST, 2007). Of the twelve priority areas, agriculture and the food sector, biotechnology and biosafety top the list. Greater collaboration between the member states and networking to optimize the resources of the region is anticipated.</p><p>
<b>Experiences in the development of virus-resistant transgenic crops in </b><b>Jamaica</b><br/>Transgenic virus resistance is the most advanced of the applications of biotechnology for the management of plant pathogens; the development of fungus- and bacteria-resistant transgenic plants has lagged behind (James, 2009). In Jamaica, work on improving virus disease resistance in papaya (<i>Carica papaya</i>), tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), pepper (<i>Capsicum annuum</i>) and citrus (<i>Citrus </i><i>sinensis</i>), is underway and is at various stages of development. A brief summary of the individual projects and challenges is presented below. </p><p>
<b><i>Papaya</i></b><br/>Papaya is consumed in many tropical and subtropical regions, but is relatively new on the international market. Commercial production of papaya in Jamaica since the mid-1980s has exceeded 20,000 metric tonnes. However, the industry is threatened by the aphid-transmitted (<i>Aphis gossypii </i>and <i>Myzus persicae</i>) <i>Papaya ringspot virus</i> disease. Diseased trees produce fruits with ring-spotting blemishes and the leaves develop mosaic patterns, resulting in a general decline in tree vigour and fruit production. Natural genetic resistance is not available in commercial papaya cultivars or wild relatives.</p><p>Using biotechnological methods, the coat protein gene of the virus has been transferred to papaya to confer virus resistance. Promising cultivars were field tested in the late 1990s and the transgenic trees have exhibited varying levels of resistance against virus infections. Moreover, selected nutritional components (e.g. vitamins, minerals, acidity and sugars) of the fruits are comparable to those of conventional papaya cultivars. Safety studies with animal models also show that there are no detrimental effects associated with the consumption of the transgenic papaya. Restricted plantings on farmers’ holdings have been put on hold while the country prepares to ratify the Cartagena Protocol with the development of the National Biosafety Framework, National Biosafety Policy and National Biosafety Act. As regards public perception, genetic engineering and transgenic crop technology stands somewhere between the US and European extremes; a favorable attitude towards the technology and an anti-biotechnology attitude. Given the hurdles, regulatory infrastructure, deregulation costs, public perception and possible trade restrictions with Europe, it may be some time before transgenic papayas become commonplace in Jamaica. </p><p>
<b><i>Tomato and pepper</i></b><br/>Tomatoes and peppers, notably Scotch bonnet peppers, are two of the major solanaceous vegetable crops grown island-wide. The popularity of Scotch bonnet pepper has increased both on the domestic and overseas ethnic markets and represents one of Jamaica’s competitive non-traditional export crops, providing significant income for small farmers and foreign exchange earnings. Many pests and diseases severely constrain the quantity, quality and marketability of tomatoes and peppers. Since the early 1990s, farmers in south and central Jamaica have reported losses of up to 100% in tomato and pepper production. Increased losses were associated with the whitefly (<i>Bemisia tabaci</i>)-transmitted geminivirus diseases, <i>Tomato yellow leaf curl virus<b> </b></i>(TYLCV) and <i>Tomato dwarf leaf curl virus<b> </b></i>(TDLCV). The diseases are generally characterized by one or more of the following symptoms; severe yellowing, yellow mosaic, leaf curl and stunting. Conventional methods of controlling diseases caused by geminiviruses have proven to be difficult, expensive and environmentally unfriendly. Given the correlation between disease incidence and whitefly populations, insecticide applications twice per week are generally employed, but with limited success and the development of resistance in the insect populations in a very short time.</p><p>The transgenic approach adopted against TYLCV involved targeting a protein involved in the replication of the virus. Transforming tomato with a mutant virus gene (<i>rep</i> mutant) would presumably interfere with the replication of the wild-type TYLCV in the field and thus provide resistance. However, after engineering and transferring the mutant gene to tomato, transgenic plants were not regenerated, so it may be back to the drawing board. Complexes of two other viruses of the <i>Potyvirus</i> group, <i>potato virus Y</i> (PVY) and <i>Tobacco etch virus</i> (TEV) also pose a serious threat to the Jamaican pepper industry. Currently, regeneration protocols of plants from pepper cotyledons and shoot tips are being worked out in preparation for transformations. TEV coat protein gene constructs will be used to develop virus-resistant transgenic pepper cultivars. </p><p>
<b><i>Citrus</i></b><br/>Although relatively small in absolute trade and production volumes, the citrus industry has an important role in the national economy. Jamaica presently produces sweet oranges, ‘Ortaniques’, grapefruit and Ugli® on some 7,000 hectares across the island. Fresh and processed fruit are exported, but production is mainly geared to the local market. However, since the mid-1980s, there have been numerous reports of decline in fruit production of this vegetatively propagated crop. One of the factors contributing to the decline is the Tristeza disease caused by the <i>Citrus tristeza virus</i> (CTV). CTV, like <i>Papaya ringspot virus</i>, is spread by aphids and also by the use of infected scion materials at grafting. The virus represents the biggest threat to the Jamaican citrus industry because 90% of the citrus orchards are established on the susceptible sour orange rootstock and the most efficient insect vector, the brown citrus aphid (<i>Toxoptera citricida</i>), is distributed throughout the island. Given the complex biology of citrus, breeding by conventional methods is difficult and few resistant or tolerant citrus cultivars are available locally. Moreover, the virus has evolved a complicated defence system that targets and efficiently overcomes the resistance mechanisms in these plants. A study of CTV strains in Jamaica has been initiated with the long-term aim of reducing losses in fruit quality and production. The widespread distribution of two economically severe CTV strains that cause decline and stem pitting syndromes was identified. Transformation of sweet orange and grapefruit materials with viral constructs that target the suppressors used by the virus in the attack on the plants’ resistance mechanisms has been initiated. </p><p>
<b>Future priorities and strategies for the Caribbean</b><br/>Although ground-breaking work has been done in some of the leading laboratories in the region, experience with transgenic plants thus far has shown that along with scientific issues, there are obvious questions surrounding the development and adoption of transgenic crops. These are linked to health and environmental safety issues, public acceptance, national and regional regulatory infrastructure and export market uncertainties. In order to harness transgenic crop research, a number of policy-level decisions need to be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis. Firstly, it is necessary to focus on crops that are of national and regional importance; contribute to food and nutritional security; support agricultural and export diversification; provide rural employment and sustain economic development. It is also important to determine how the use of a transgenic crop variety compares to other alternatives, namely cost-benefit analyses of alternative research and development approaches to solve the agronomic problem. Traits to be altered should also be carefully considered so as to minimize biosafety risks related to the movement of the transgenic traits to other cultivars and wild relatives leading to the erosion of biodiversity; ecological disturbances; effects on non-target organisms, and toxic or allergenic reactions in humans and animals. Although the exact consequences of gene escape on biodiversity are difficult to predict and possibly depend on the trait and the environment, the potential risks cannot be ignored. The biodiversity of the region is regarded as unique, consisting of highly adapted species of narrow genetic diversity. The biology of the crop will therefore be of paramount importance. That is, if the crop is vegetatively propagated, does not produce seeds (e.g. banana, sugarcane) or is self-pollinated (e.g., rice), the probability of transgene movement is limited. Similarly, the end-use of the agricultural product is relevant. If the product is not consumed (e.g. ornamentals such as anthurium flowers), concerns regarding toxicity and allergenicity are minimal, as for those products that are highly processed (e.g. sugar, refined coconut oil). </p><p>Attractive traits for transgenic crops with potential in the Caribbean region include resistance to pests (which would invariably reduce chemical control measures) and resistance against virus diseases (which pose severe challenge to management and for which chemical control measures are not applicable). Other crop applications expected in the near term and with relevant application to the Caribbean region include enhanced tolerance to abiotic stresses, namely drought and salt tolerance, as well as crops with increased nitrogen efficiency for mitigating climate change. Crops that are more nutritious are also expected, along with crops that contain two or more stacked traits that confer multiple benefits. </p><p>Apart from a product-focused approach, an important challenge in the development and distribution of any transgenic product in the Caribbean relates to biosafety regulation. The related legislation; regulations and guidelines, represent the means of managing or controlling the risks associated with the use and release of transgenic crops, and do not exist in many Caribbean countries. Moreover, large international seed companies that own the rights to commercial biotechnology products are not willing to sell them to countries that do not have a regulatory system in place. Having received approval for field testing and conducted the appropriate safety assessments, the next stage, that is the development of the transgenic product for commercial production, also presents a challenge, particularly in regions with an undeveloped seed industry and weak or nonexistent legislation for intellectual property rights. Further, regulations requiring extensive and costly biosafety assessments run the risk of stifling the further development and application of the technology. The ‘technological readiness’ of the clients, namely the farmers, processors and consumers, is another significant factor influencing the successful adoption of transgenic technology in the region. Trade concerns also complicate biosafety approvals. The reluctance of major Caribbean trading partners to import transgenic commodities will not foster planting of transgenic commodities and can serve to increase the reluctance of national governments to approve the development and planting of these crops which could further destroy export markets for agricultural commodities. </p><p>
<b>Conclusion</b><br/>In summary, countries in the Caribbean region share some of the vulnerabilities concerning their agricultural and food sectors that are common to all developing nations but they are also vulnerable to unique factors of island economies. Advances in transgenic crop technology offer tools for the management of some of the challenges prevalent in agricultural systems and for ensuring food and livelihood security. However, they are not a panacea for addressing all challenges and given the time, cost and expertise required for the development of these crops, it is imperative to prioritize the crops and traits to be engineered. Moreover, several of the biosafety and related environmental and food safety concerns associated with the cultivation of and trade in transgenic crops remain relevant and thus appropriate policies and strategies to safeguard against potential adverse effects are required.</p><p>Scientific capacity, judicious choice of crops and traits, openness of export markets and regulatory policies as well as public acceptance can ensure the safe and profitable deployment of transgenic crops. An appropriate mix of conventional plant breeding methods and the tools of modern biotechnology, such as genetic transformation as well as other tools, micro-propagation and plant tissue culture, molecular marker technology and methods for the diagnosis of food-crop diseases, are needed for accelerated crop improvement in the region. Scientists, policymakers, farmers and other agro and food industry actors need to be engaged in finalizing the Caribbean Biotechnology and Biosafety policy and strategy for harnessing this technology for sustainable socio-economic development.</p><p>
