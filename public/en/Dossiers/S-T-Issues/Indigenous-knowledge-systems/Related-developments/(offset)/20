						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	The term “nightshade” refers collectively to a wide-ranging group of plants, including poisonous, medicinal, and edible species (from the genus Solanum). This includes three major crops of global importance: tomato, potato, and eggplant. The broad-leafed African nightshade (Solanum scabrum) is widely cultivated in sub-Saharan Africa on smallholder plots and in home gardens around cities. African nightshade is sometimes referred to as black nightshade or garden huckleberry. The vegetable is an excellent source of protein, iron, vitamin A, iodine, zinc. Nightshades are traditionally used worldwide as medicinal plants, especially to treat stomach ailments. Leaf extracts from African nightshade are used to treat diarrhea, eye infections, and jaundice. The raw fruit is sometimes chewed to treat stomach ulcers or stomachache. There are no solid statistics on how much African nightshade is currently cultivated. But the crop is one of the most important indigenous leafy vegetables in West and Central Africa, and to a lesser extent East Africa, according to Plant Resources of Tropical Africa (PROTA). Cameroon produces enough African nightshade to export to neighboring countries. According to Patrick Maundu at Bioversity International, demand for the crop has recently risen significantly since East African supermarkets started stocking it. In September of 2010, Kenyan Professor Mary Onyango-Abukutsa—who is quoted in ‘State of the World 2011: Innovations that Nourish the Planet’ - was awarded a grant by Kenya’s National Council for Science and Technology to lead research on African indigenous vegetables at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology. Her research will focus on three key vegetables: African nightshade, spider plant, and amaranth. Professor Mary Onyango-Abukutsa was the first place winner of the 2008/2009 Africa-wide Women in Science Competitions that was organized by CTA in collaboration with several partners.(source: Worldwatch Institute, 7 Feb. 2011)</p>

	This research activity is part of the 'Mood Indigo Caribbean - Dyeing for the Blues' project that is being conducted by Dr Sonia Peter, head of the Department of Chemistry, at the Barbados Community College in collaboration with the Barbados Fashion Alliance and funded by the UNDP. Selected plant species will be investigated for natural dye sources. The dyes will be subjected to a variety of analytical methods for chemical profiling and efficacy. As Indigo was once of economic significance to the island during the colonial period, the project aims to revive the interest in indigo within the local fashion industry. In addition, extracts from other indigenous plant species used in traditional medicine will be subjected to analytical investigation including chromatography and spectroscopy for suitability as sources. Novel agents will be explored for the indigo fermentation process and as aggregator for the dyeing process. All fabrics will be of natural fibres with a focus on Sea Island Cotton, which is known to be of high quality. Toxicity testing of the natural dyes developed is also planned. This is in an effort to green the sector of the local fashion industry that is involved in textile manufacture.

	The <a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Issues/Biotechnology/S-T-Organisations-Web-resources/African-Centre-for-Biosafety-ACB" target="_blank">African Centre for Biosafety (ACB)</a> has focused several recent reports on new international commercial interest and patent claims on the African native crop sorghum. This includes the issues raised by the proposed widespread use of sorghum for the production of biofuels. This report extends ACB’s examination of new international commercial interest in African native crops, by including a focus on pearl millet (<i>Pennisetum glaucum</i>) and related African native grass species in the <i>Pennisetum</i> genus.Pearl millet, the most important African Pennisetum economically and for food security, shows promise to foreign researchers for a variety of applications. The paper explains that a foreign government project in South Africa working on pearl millet is seeking to stimulate development of the seed industry in Africa by replacing traditional varieties with commercial hybrids, and by creating pearl millets for specific uses including poultry feed and for biofuels.According to the paper, the ongoing unchecked provision of African farmers’ varieties of pearl millet to the US INTSORMIL (International Sorghum and Millet Collaborative Research Support) Program, without the use of appropriate material transfer agreements, seems alarming and there are fears that over time these practices are likely to result in biopiracy. It appears the seed transfer arrangements do not enjoy the protections and benefit sharing of the multilateral system under the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA).</p>

	Learn-Grow (LG) Solomon Islands project will be jointly carried out by the Rotary club of Devonport North, Australia, the Rotary club of Honiara and Food Plants International. The project was launched by permanent secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Edward Kingmele yesterday in Honiara. The objective of the project is to increase understanding and value of local food plants in enhanced nutrition and food security. Chairman of LG committee Buz Green said the principle aim is to increase knowledge and understanding of the food plants occurring in the Solomon Islands whether they are native plants or introduced. The LG project is based on a life time of work by a Tasmanian Agriculturist Reg French who has collated a database of edible plants for all countries of the world. By far the project, with the assistance of the two Rotary clubs, has helped to create publications on the local food plants. The publications include the reference book titled ‘Food Plants of Solomon Islands’. He appealed to Solomon Islanders to come up with local <i>pijin</i> names for food plants, advocate for local food plants, and provide as many photos of food plants for the project.

	Financed by the European Commission (FP7), the 4-year ‘AFTER’ project, launched in September 2010 and coordinated by CIRAD, France, involves interdisciplinary teams from seven countries in Africa (Benin, Cameroon, Ghana, Egypt, Madagascar, Senegal, South Africa) and four in Europe (France, Italy, Portugal, United Kingdom). Its aim is to acquire knowledge of the current know-how, consumption habits, technologies and processes associated with the following three traditional food products groups: fermented, cereal-based foods, meat and dried fish products, and products based on plant extracts. The project will propose ways of optimizing the traditional processes so as to improve the products’ sanitary and nutritional quality while maintaining or improving their organoleptic characteristics. Market accessibility will also be assessed with consumer tests to determine product acceptability criteria. The results obtained will be tested by African small- and medium-sized food enterprises involved in the project, before being disseminated in the form of guidelines that can be used by firms willing to produce these products.

	The town of Genadendal is the focus of a new indigenous knowledge project that aims to establish the town’s small farmers as independent producers of a unique African herbal tea. The project, which will run for three years until 2012, is funded by South Africa’s Department of Science and Technology. ‘We believe that the specific type of honeybush that grows naturally in the Genadendal area holds significant economic potential that can be unlocked to the benefit of the local community,’ explains project leader Professor Lizette Joubert, a researcher at the Agricultural Research Council’s (ARC) Infruitec Nietvoorbij Research Institute in Stellenbosch. ARC researchers will work closely with the Genadendal Small Farmers’ Association led by local community leader Reverend Chris Wessels. They will set up a demonstration plot and develop guidelines for nursery operations, farming practices and tea processing to help new farmers get started. The next step will be to optimise the processing of the tea, based on the community’s traditions. The project also aims to add value to the locally produced honeybush by looking at the production of extracts that can be used in many applications in the food and cosmetics industries.

If Dr Graham Lyons has his way, the orange-fleshed sweet potato will become the staple food crop in Melanesia within the next decade, providing much-needed Vitamin A to boost immunity and curb major nutritional deficiencies. The University of Adelaide research fellow has spent the last two and a half years in the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea, working on a project to encourage villagers to eat orange-fleshed sweet potatoes and other coloured local produce in preference to imported foods. Funded by HarvestPlus and the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), the project has been an outstanding success, restoring pride in locally-grown foods and reducing the spread of malaria and eye problems.

ndigenous African knowledge has much to offer to science — but only if science can be translated into local languages. Africans have a rich cultural heritage and a wealth of traditional knowledge on topics ranging from agriculture and forestry to medicines and medical practices — all of which could make valuable contributions to modern science.Much of this type of knowledge is embedded in the diverse local languages and cultures found in Africa. Yet despite centuries of scientific undertakings on the continent, there is still no vernacular word for 'science'. This marginalization of African languages and practices means much local knowledge is lost. Many innovations by farmers and rural communities are excluded from modern science and technology (S&amp;T) because there are no local terms or expressions to capture them.

					<p>The brief ‘Future Health: Sustainable Management of Africa’s Medicinal Plants’ highlights that eighty per cent of Africans use traditional treatments made from wild native plant species and one-third depend on them entirely. As populations go up so does the use; over-exploitation is rampant. Control is imperative to sustain forest resources before they are lost, potentially denying millions access to medicines. Scientists are producing tools that can make sustainable management a reality. Policy makers are encouraged to support groups such as Indigenous Resources Working Group in Southern Africa and take advantage of new management approaches and tools as they become available.

					<p>
In Kenya, agricultural extension officers offer seasonal and locally relevant climate predictions explained in simple terms in Kikamba, the regional tribal language. They are now producing a handbook to translate weather predictions into practical advice about what and when to plant. The project also helped farmers set up a seed bank. A group of about 40 men will collect, process and preserve the best local seeds and loan them out again during the next planting season, slowly selecting for the best climate-adapted varieties. Now, farmers can circumvent the expensive seed market, where they can't even tell if they are getting the seed varieties they are paying for.(Source: Scientific American, 29 March 2010)</p>

					<p>A collaborative study between forest scientists from 13 organizations, universities and research institutions makes specific recommendations for incorporating indigenous lands and other protected areas into strategies to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. It concludes that strengthening support for indigenous lands and other protected areas is a “win-win” situation: it could mitigate climate change while securing the planet’s natural and cultural heritage.

By Patrick Karani, Frederick Ahwireng-Obeng, James Kung’u, Caleb Wafula 
Bureau of Environmental Analysis International, February 2010. This report compiles a series of case studies that determine the potential of indigenous knowledge for the mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The case studies assess the indigenous knowledge practiced and applied by local communities in East, West and Southern Africa regions and determine the benefits of integrating indigenous knowledge into mitigation and adaptation programmes and projects. Overall, they show how indigenous knowledge can add value to the development of sustainable climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies that support local communities’ efforts in addressing problems of climate change and ensuring sustainable conservation and natural resource management.</p>

					<p>In this radio programme native peoples from the Arctic and the Amazon to Pacific islands testify to what is happening to them, as seas and temperatures continue to rise disrupting their ancestral livelihoods. Their responses to these changes offer much-needed guidance about how to develop the resilience and inventiveness that are essential to humanity’s long-term survival.

					<p>Databases of traditional medicines can help protect against biopiracy while opening the doors for new drug discovery. Traditional biological knowledge tends to be uncomfortably juxtaposed between two worlds — the ancient, where knowledge was freely shared by all, and the modern, where it is jealously protected through patents. But the past few months have seen milestones in bridging this divide as the European Patent Office (EPO) revoked a patent for a traditional remedy extracted from the roots of endemic South African plants. A growing trend exists to incorporate traditional knowledge into modern patent applications. (Source: SciDev.net, Priya Shetty, 24 February 2010)</p>
