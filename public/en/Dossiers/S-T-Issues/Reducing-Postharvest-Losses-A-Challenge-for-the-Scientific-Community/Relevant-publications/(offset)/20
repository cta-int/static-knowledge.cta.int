						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p><i>IIED Reflect and Act Briefing; July 2011</i>This <a href="http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/G03126.pdf" target="_blank">briefing</a> reflects on IIED's Regoverning Markets project, which looked at how the 'supermarket revolution' was affecting poor producers. It showcases how public and private actors can use policy and innovative business models to ensure modernisation includes smallholders. The objective of the Regoverning Markets project was to support policies and practices on agrifood market modernisation that are inclusive of small-scale producers, by generating evidence and facilitating policy dialogues. Key findings show that small-scale farmers are often unaffected by modernisation of food markets, because flexible wholesalers mediate the changes: this changes as food safety and traceability become top priorities. Also, integrating small producers requires organised farmers and pertinent public and private policies. Moreover, it found that companies with inclusive business models are keystones for pro-poor development – as are ‘bridging partners’ who act to match farm produce with customer demands. This briefing thus reflects on IIED’s farm-to-market project and its possible contribution to future development to alleviate rural poverty.</p>

					<p><i>G. Porto, N. D. Chauvin and M. Olarreaga; World Bank; 2011</i>The focus of this <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTRANETTRADE/Resources/Supply_Chains.pdf" target="_blank">book</a> is on a neglected source of 'real costs' for farmers in low-income countries: market power along the supply chain. The authors argue that the exercise of market power along the supply chain will have a number of possible effects. Given that the impacts on prices will imply a redistribution of income across agents in the economy, there will also be implications for poverty and the attainment of poverty reduction objectives. The analysis shows that the effects of market power on income distribution and the incomes of poor households can be significant. It also demonstrates that there is much heterogeneity, both across countries for a given crop, and within a country for different crops. Measures to increase competition – to make the market structure less concentrated – will have effects similar to those resulting from actions to reduce customs clearance times, facilitate the movement of goods across borders, and so forth. The latter are issues that are at the forefront of the policy agenda in many countries and the activities of development agencies. The analysis is not only an interesting exercise but it is of great policy significance as it suggests that more attention should be devoted to competition policy in low-income countries. </p>

Title: Increasing Food Availability by Reducing Postharvest Losses of Fresh Produce
Author: A.A. Kader
Source: Proc. 5th Int. Postharvest Symposium (Acta Horticultura) Date: 2005Qualitative losses (such as loss of caloric and nutritive value, loss of acceptability by consumers, and loss of edibility) are more difficult to measure than quantitative losses of fresh fruits and vegetables. While reduction of quantitative losses is a higher priority than qualitative losses in developing countries, the opposite is true in developed countries where consumer dissatisfaction with produce quality results in a greater percentage of the total postharvest losses. Providing consumers with fruits and vegetables that taste good can greatly increase their consumption of the recommended minimum of five servings per day. Development of new cultivars with better flavor and nutritional quality plus adequate productivity should be given high priority in all countries. Strategies for reducing postharvest losses in developing countries include: (1) Application of current knowledge to improve the handling systems (especially packaging and cold chain maintenance) of horticultural perishables and assure their quality and safety; (2) Overcoming the socioeconomic constraints, such as inadequacies of infrastructure, poor marketing systems, and weak R&amp;D capacity; and (3) Encouraging consolidation and vertical integration among producers and marketers of horticultural crops.</p>

Title: Technology for post-harvest processing of pearl millet and sorghum in Africa
Author: J.P. Wilson
Source: Compatible Technology International and USDADate: November 2008Prototype devices developed by Compatible Technology International were evaluated for threshing, winnowing, and decorticating pearl millet and sorghum. Criteria considered were 1) ease of operation, 2) capacity, and 3) ability to produce clean, unbroken grains. Advantages of the Leary thresher were its comparative ease of operation and high capacity. Disadvantages included a higher frequency of cracked grain and a high level of chaff contamination in the final product. A winnowing step prior to the separation step improved the output quality by reducing residual chaff. Advantages of the Ewing thresher were its versatility and options, and the high quality of the resulting grain. Disadvantages included difficulty of feeding strippings into the device, difficulty with material discharge and cleaning after processing, and poorer performance when hand-cranked compared to the electric motor driven option. When coupled with the other technologies in these trials, the Leary thresher could produce 50 kg of pearl millet grain in 10.9 hours, whereas the Ewing thresher with metal blades and electric motor would require 16.5 hours. The processing steps should be examined to determine if output can be improved to compare to the 5 to 11 woman-hours required to process 50 kg of grain by using traditional threshing and winnowing processes. If the capacity or quality achieved by the existing prototypes cannot meet this goal, additional prototype designs should be considered.</p>

Title: Control of post harvest disease (<i>Botryodiplodia</i> sp.) of rambutan and annona species by using a bio-control agent (<i>Trichoderma </i>sp.)
Author: R. Kunz
Source: Industrial Technology Institute and the International Centre for Underutilised CropsDate: June 2007Experiments were undertaken by the Industrial Technology Institute (ITI) in cooperation with the International Centre for Underutilised Crops (ICUC) to prove the availability of <i>Trichoderma</i> sp. in Sri Lanka and their effectiveness as Bio-control agents (BC-agents) against <i>Botryodiplodia </i>sp. The <i>Trichoderma</i> sp. used in the experiments were isolated from soil samples taken from several locations in Sri Lanka and the pathogens were isolated from diseased fruits of <i>Annona squamosa</i>, <i>Annona muricata</i> and rambutan (<i>Nephelium lappaceum</i>). Bio-assays were undertaken to prove the effectiveness of the BC-agents. In addition crossinoculation experiments were done to see whether the pathogens of various fruits infect each other. Furthermore a sporulation experiment was attempted to check if a reduction of the sporulation time of <i>Botryodiplodia</i> sp. under special treatments (cold shock and daylight) is possible.</p>

Title: Risk and economic perspectives of post harvest decisions: an application of Bayesian theory to smallholder farming in Oyo State, South Western Nigeria
Author: L.O. Olarinde, S.O. Okunola and A. Anifowose
Source:<i> Research Journal of Social Sciences</i> 2: 91-97Date: 2007This study is conceived to quantitatively assess the profitability status of farmers’ post harvest actions, the risks and uncertainties attached to these actions and to ultimately determine the most optimally and economically viable and sustainable of the actions. A representative number of 300 smallholder farmers from 100 farming communities scattered over 20 local government areas (LGAs) from the 4 agricultural development project (ADP) zones of Oyo State were selected by a multistage stratified sampling technique. Data collected include (1) primary: types of food crops grown, outputs and sales there from, information on socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the farming households; (2) secondary data: which include time-series information on monthly and periodic market and farm gate prices of food crops in the state. Data were analyzed by using the descriptive statistics such as percentage, tables, means and frequencies and the Bayesian (risk) decision theory. The Bayesian theory was used to determine farmers’ optimum farming strategies prior to market predictions and when markets are “normal” and in “short supply.” Results show that prior to market predictions, cocoa in Ibadan, Ibarapa and Oyo; Mango in Ogbomoso and groundnut in Saki zones are crops with the best (optimum) strategy. When market is predicted to be “normal” cocoa in Ibadan/Ibarapa and Oyo; mango and groundnut in Ogbomoso and Saki zones respectively, command optimum returns. With market being in “short supply,” cocoa has the highest expected return after processing and storage in Ibadan/Ibarapa and Oyo zones. In Saki zone, cassava has the highest return, while in Ogbomoso zone, Mango fruit commanded the highest expected return. Findings under “normal” and “short supply” conditions of market reveal that the prevention of financial and economic shocks resulting from market and price variability and fluctuations will involve the growing of annual and or perennial cash crops being intensified, while annual and seasonal crops be maintained at the level of recovering investment cost and satisfying the farm’s family immediate food need and the deserved reserve from output.</p>

Title: Institutional capabilities for agro-processing technologies in Africa: trends from Nigeria’s livestock industry
Author: M. Bokanga 
Source: IITADate: 2001It was found in this symposium that there is a need to encourage collaboration among scientists in the universities, Research Institutes and the private sector. The Post-harvest Initiative can stimulate this through promoting and monitoring projects that ensure partnerships between researchers and the private sector. Universities and Research Institutes need to advertise their expertise as corporate bodies rather than expending energy on narrow disciplines of individual researchers. Coordinated research programmes must be encouraged. Changes in curricula in Agriculture must be effected to make them relevant to Agricultural industries. There is the need to reach out to clients in industries and acquaint them with benefits from research collaboration and exposure of staff and students to private sector needs. The thrust in training should be to build job creators rather than Job seekers. Training for small-scale farmers must recognize their capability as practical farmers usually with little education. On the other hand jobless youths in many African countries though educated lack practical capability in farming. Both groups can be stimulated through emphasizing Agriculture as a sustainable and profitable business from field to markets. Agricultural extension capabilities are presently limited by funds. Extension services should be privatized through professionalism in various disciplines. There should be access to information among scientists to avoid re-invention of the will (wheel) and encourage packaging of market oriented, coordinated, multi disciplinary research and development projects</p>

Title: The impact of post harvest research
Author: F. Goletti and C. Wolff
Source: International Food Policy Research InstituteDate: 1999While research on the improvement of agricultural production has received considerable attention and funding, postharvest activities have not attracted much attention from international research organizations. However, there is an emerging consensus on the critical role that postharvest systems can play in meeting the overall goals of food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable agriculture particularly in developing countries. This study provides preliminary evidence on the impact of postharvest research on these goals; furthermore the study argues that postharvest research at international agricultural research organizations is justified by its international public good nature.</p>

Title: Post-Harvest Innovations: Reflections on Partnership and Learning
Author: A.J. Hall, B. Yoganand, R.V. Sulaiman and N.G. Clark (Eds.)
Source: Crop Post Harvest Programme, South AsiaDate: 2003In the post-harvest area and in agriculture research in general, both in India and internationally, policy attention is returning to the question of how innovation can be encouraged and promoted and thus how impact on the poor can be achieved. This publication assembles several cases from the post-harvest sector. These provide examples of successful innovation that emerged in quite different ways. Its purpose is to illustrate and analyze the diversity and often highly context-specific nature of the processes that lead to and promote innovation. The presented cases suggest a number of generic principles needed to develop the capacity of innovation systems: the need to pay more attention to revealing and managing the historical and institutional context of partnerships and relationship; the need to build on local contexts and circumstance rather than introducing external blueprints; and the need to strengthen the learning process and to link this to the broader agenda of institutional change, particularly concerning the governance of public science endeavours.</p>

Title: Biological control of post-harvest diseases of fruits and vegetables: alternatives to synthetic fungicides
Author: C.L. Wilson, M.E. Wisniewski, C.L. Biles, R. McLaughlin, E. Chalutz and S. Droby
Source: United States Department of AgricultureDate: 1991Spoilage of fruits and vegetables after harvest often causes losses as great as 25-50% of the harvested crop. Much of this is due to rot micro-organisms which are currently controlled by refrigeration and fungicides. A number of bacterial and fungal antagonists have been found that can effectively control post-harvest rots of peaches, citrus, apples, grapes and tomatoes. These antagonists have various modes of action that include antibiosis and/or competition for nutrients and space. The commercialization of some of these antagonists to control post-harvest decay of fruits and vegetables appears to be feasible and may present an alternative to synthetic pesticides.</p>

Title: Post-harvest studies of flour hardening and tubers’ transformation conditions 
Author: G.J.M. Medoua Nama 
Source: Thesis PhD ENSIA / Université de NgaoundéréDate: 2005<i>Dioscorea dumetorum</i> (Kunth) Pax tubers constitute a good source of nutrients and energy. Their storage under tropical ambient conditions renders them susceptible to a hardening phenomenon characterised by loss of the ability to soften during cooking. This study was carried out with the aim of determining tuber hardening mechanism; evaluate physicochemical changes occurring during tuber storage and to find out pre-treatment conditions of hardened tubers for their processing into flour. Results obtained showed that <i>D. dumetorum </i>tubers hardening follows a multiple mechanism, which includes phytate hydrolysis as a minimal contributor to cooked hardness and total phenols loss via a lignification-like mechanism as a major contributor.</p>

Title: Étude synergique du couplage du Système Lactoperoxydase avec d’autres molécules naturelles actives ayant des propriétés antifongiques pour l’amélioration de la conservation en frais des bananes
Author: W. Sagoua
Source: Thesis PhDDate: 2009Postharvest diseases are a major concern for several plant products, leading to considerable postharvest losses.<i> Colletotrichum musae </i>is responsible for anthracnose and is also involved in crown rot, the two main postharvest diseases of bananas. The use of natural anti-microbial agents such as the lactoperoxidase system (LPS) represents an interesting alternative to the use of fungicides for the control of postharvest diseases of bananas. This study consisted on optimization of the LPS by adding iodide or substituting the thiocyanate by iodide. Moreover, other substances like lactoferrin, Bioxeda and Neem oil were analyzed for their antifungal effect. The last two compounds gave an inhibition higher than 90% and 40% respectively. No effect of lactoferrin was observed.</p>

Title: Biology and genetic engineering of fruit maturation for enhanced quality and shelf-life
Author: A.J. Matas, N.E. Gapper, Mi-Young Chung et al.
Source: <i>Current Opinion in Biotechnology </i>20: (2) 197-203Date: 2009Commercial regulation of ripening is currently achieved through early harvest, by controlling the postharvest storage atmosphere and genetic selection for slow or late ripening varieties. Although these approaches are often effective, they are not universally applicable and often result in acceptable, but poor quality, products. With increased understanding of the molecular biology underlying ripening and the advent of genetic engineering technologies, researchers have pursued new strategies to address problems in fruit shelf-life and quality. These have been guided by recent insights into mechanisms by which ethylene and a complex network of transcription factors regulate ripening and by an increased appreciation of factors that contribute to shelf-life, such as the fruit cuticle.</p>

Title: Potassium permanganate effects in postharvest conservation of the papaya cultivar Sunrise Golden
Author: D.F. Pereira Silva, L.C. Chamhum Salomão, D. Lopes de Siqueira, P.R. Cecon and A. Rocha
Source: <i>Pesquisa Agropecueria Brasileira </i>44: (7) 669-675Date: 2009The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of KMnO4 on the extension of postharvest life of 'Sunrise Golden' papaya, stored under modified atmosphere and refrigeration. Fruit with up to 10% yellow peel were harvested in a commercial orchard in Linhares, state of Espírito Santo, Brazil. Sets of three fruit (unit mass of 289.9±18.5 g) were wrapped in low-density polyethylene films (28 ¼m thick) containing sachets of KMnO4 at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 g per bag. The bags were sealed and stored at 10.4±0.9°C and 90±5% relative humidity for 25 days. After this period, the fruit were removed from the bags and maintained at 21±0.8°C and 90±5% relative humidity until complete ripening. Four days after bag sealing, CO2 concentration stabilized in all treatments, and was higher in bags without KMnO4. In all treatments, fruit reached the climacteric respiratory peak on the third day after bag removal, coinciding with peel color index of 3.5. Increasing the KMnO4 dose reduced the losses in fruit fresh matter, consistency and pulp electrolyte leakage. Potassium permanganate was effective in maintaining the fruit at the pre-climacteric stage during the 25-day storage, and did not interfere with normal ripening after bag removal.</p>

Title: Vinegar production from Togolese local variety Mangovi of mango <i>Mangifera indica </i>Linn. (Anacardiaceae)
Author: Y. Ameyapoh, J.Y. Leveau, S.D. Karou, M. Bouix, S.K. Sossou and C. de Souza
Source: <i>Pak. J. Biol. Sciences</i>, 13: 132-137
Date: 2010DOI: 10.3923/pjbs.2010.132.137This study aimed to access for the physiochemical parameters of vinegar production through Togolese local variety Mangovi of mango <i>Mangifera indica </i>juice fermentation. The juice was fermented successively by<i> Saccharomyces cerevisisae</i> and acetic bacteria. The levels of ethanol and acetic acid in the juice during the production of vinegar were monitored by gas chromatography and titrimetry methods, respectively. The physiological state of the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> L2056 was determined by flow cytometry using a dual fluorescent labeling of diacetate carboxy-fluorescein (CFDA) and propidium iodide. The results indicated that 200 mL of mango juice, sugar content 20 Brix, set in alcoholic fermentation with 106 yeast cells produced 22.4 g L-1 ethanol in 72 h. Acetic fermentation transformed 93% of this ethanol to acetic acid in 288 h. Twenty-four hours after the beginning of alcoholic fermentation, 91% of cells were viable, 8.85% were stressed and 0.05% died. After 24 h of acetic fermentation, viable, stressed and dead cells were 45, 12 and 39%, respectively; corresponding to the passage of acetic vinegar level from 0.9 to 2.1°. At the end of the acetic fermentation, dead cells were estimated to 98% at and acetic acid to 4.7°. Using consecutive fermentations is a suitable technique for vinegar production from mango juice. The application of the present results may contribute to avoiding post harvest losses of fruits.</p>

Title: Dried products from Central African savannahs. Prospects and constraints
Author: C. Cerdan, L. Hamadou, A. Kameni et al.
Source: Savanes africaines : des espaces en mutation, des acteurs face à de nouveaux défis. Actes du colloque, Garoua, CamerounDate: 2003Dried products represent an important economic stake for Central African Savannah populations. They reduce post harvest losses. The powder of Chad dried tomato, the tatasse, or powder pepper are widely spread / available commodities. Their success with African populations is quite obvious. It is based on several studies on dried products, carried out within the framework of PRASAC and research-development projects which have brought together Central African research teams: the study of Abeché’s dried tomato network, the description of the consumption of dried fruits in North Cameroon, the first attempts to sell dried mangoes, the supporting projects for the valorisation of yams for urban markets. It lays emphasis on the presence of similar products on the market, thus the success of this commodity is not secured. Dried mango stands as a “new product”, compared to dried tomato and tatassé. Reflecting on the situation of this product is an important step. It enables to reduce the launching costs of a new activity.</p>
