						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

Title: Consumer perception and application of edible coatings on fresh-cut fruits and vegetables
Author: S. Sonti
Source: ThesisDate: 2003Plasticized whey protein coatings have been shown to extend the shelf life of fresh produce. This thesis research was designed to determine consumer acceptance and perception of fresh-cut fruits and vegetables (FCFV) and edible coatings (EC) and to determine effects of plasticized whey protein coatings (WPC) on quality of fresh-cut apples. Two studies were conducted. This study demonstrates potential of WPC as an EC for FC apples and helps the food industry meet consumer and market demand regarding FCFV.</p>

Title: Development of Ozone-Based Processes for Decontamination of Fresh Produce to enhance Safety and Extend Shelflife
Author: M. Vurma
Source: ThesisDate: 2009Although good agricultural practices (GAP) and good handling practices (GHP) may reduce the incidence of pathogens in fresh produce, there is no known defence against contamination due to wildlife or surface water. Additionally, current strategies designed to minimize the risk of contamination during post-harvest operations of fresh leafy greens are not completely effective. Contamination of fresh fruits with spoilage microorganisms also creates economical losses by decreasing product shelf life. Therefore, it is necessary to develop sound mitigation strategies to minimize the health hazards associated with contaminated fresh produce. The main objectives of this study are to enhance the safety of fresh produce in general, by integrating ozone-based sanitization steps into existing processing practices, while targeting <i>Escherichia coli</i> O157:H7 as the pathogen of concern, and to assess the feasibility of using ozone, carbon dioxide or their combination, for reducing natural microbiota, and extending the shelf-life of strawberries.</p>

Source: <i>Fruits </i>64: (1) 19-34Date: 2009
 The baobab (<i>Adansonia digitata L</i>.) is a tree that grows wild in Senegal, where the fruit is consumed in various forms. If the ecology and botany of plants have been well studied, work on the transformation of fruit or the impact of processing treatments on the quality of the finished products is rare. To assess the technological potential of the processing treatment for these fruits, prior to the development of their transformation products in local, regional and international markets, we sought to characterize the raw material (biochemical composition and nutritional quality), and to study the product that produces nectar.</p>

Title: Drying technologies for Caribbean agro-industry using solar energy
Author: C.K. Sankat
Source: University of the West IndiesDate: 2004Drying is an energy intensive process which involves the removal of moisture from a crop until the moisture content of the crop is in equilibrium with the surrounding air. Crops are usually dried to a moisture content that will allow safe storage and/or further processing (milling for example). The drying behaviour of different crops depends to a large extent on the physical characteristics of the crop, for example particle size, internal structure and composition. These characteristics are crop specific, and so the drying behaviour of crops is usually different. In order to select an appropriate dryer and the drying parameters such as drying time and temperature, it is important to understand the drying behaviour of the material to be dried. This principle forms the basis of many drying studies, which are conducted to determine moisture loss characteristics, physical and biochemical changes of specific crops.</p>

Title: Postharvest Management of Fruit and Vegetables in the Asia-Pacific Region
Author: edited by R.S. Rolle
Source: Reports of the APO seminar on Reduction of Postharvest Losses of Fruit and VegetablesDate: 2005To discuss the issues and challenges in strengthening postharvest management of fruit and vegetables, the APO organized two seminars. The first seminar on the “Reduction of Postharvest Losses of Fruit and Vegetables” was hosted by the Government of India in New Delhi from 5 to 11 October 2004 (<i>hereafter called the India Seminar</i>). This seminar discussed recent developments in management of postharvest losses of fruit and vegetables, and issues and constraints in reducing postharvest losses. The second seminar on “Marketing and Food Safety: Challenges in Postharvest Management of Agricultural/Horticultural Products”, was hosted by the Government of Islamic Republic of Iran from 23 to 28 July 2005 (<i>hereafter called the Iran Seminar</i>). The latter seminar focused on emerging marketing and food safety issues and challenges in the postharvest management of fruit and vegetables, and impediments in addressing them. This publication is a compilation of the selected resource papers and country papers presented at the seminars.</p>

Title: Postharvest treatment of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) in Botswana 
Author: C. Mogkoko
Source: CGIAR FoodNetDate: 2001Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) is undoubtedly the staple cereal of Botswana and is grown widely in the country. Eisener et al. (1982) reported statistics of surveys conducted in the Southern and Southeastern districts of Botswana, in which 96% of the respondents indicate that they eat sorghum. In another study reported by IICT (1997), conducted in Northeastern Botswana, 52% of the respondents ate sorghum-based foods every day. Several varieties of sorghum and millet, both indigenous and exotic, are grown in the country. All these varieties have proved to be of good food value, and may be used for different industrial applications. The development of these varieties, and their subsequent use, has been steered by a number of institutions in the country and abroad, notably, the Ministry of Agriculture, SADC/ICRISAT, THE Botswana Technology Centre (and its international collaborators-CIRAD, NRI AND IICT), and others. An identified constraint that continues to hinder the national objective of food security is postproduction losses. These losses are believed to be high in magnitude although there is no loss assessment studies carried out in the country. These losses are caused by a number of agents, mainly insects and postproduction practices. This paper seeks to examine post harvest treatments of sorghum and highlight the challenges and opportunities facing the crop post harvest.</p>

Title: Post Harvest Apple Practises in South Africa
Author: I. Crouch
Source: Washington Tree Fruit Postharvest ConferenceDate: December 2003South Africa currently has over 22,500 hectares under apple production. The main apple growing areas are in the Western Cape with some recent plantings of Royal Gala in the Orange Free State. Over 18 million cartons of apples are exported from South Africa each year to the United Kingdom (39%), Central Europe (23%), Middle and Far East (24%), Africa (11%) and the Americas (3%). Apples constitute 30% of the total deciduous crop in South Africa. Apples have been grown in South Africa since 1652, when Jan van Riebeeck established the first plantings. Good post harvest practices have arisen from the need to continually improve quality to meet more and more stringent market requirements. It is imperative to maintain these high standards from the time the fruit is harvested until it is sold.</p>

Title: Effect of edible coatings on the shelf life of in natura guava (Psidium guajava L.) stored under refrigeration
Author: F.M. Fakhouri, C. Grosso
Source: <i>Braz. J. Food Technol</i>. 6: (2) 203-211Date: 2003Filmogenic coatings produced with gelatin, triacetin and lauric acid were applied to white guava fruits during the mature green stage. The fruits were stored under refrigeration for twenty days, together with an uncoated control. The physiochemical characteristics used to evaluate maturation included pH, titratable acidity, °Brix, total and reducing sugars, hardness, colour and loss in weight, and were measured at four-day intervals. In addition the shelf life was evaluated by a sensory analysis, including overall appearance, shine, color and buying intention at the same intervals. A specific sensory analysis for flavour, aroma, texture and buying intention was applied after 9 days of storage. The coatings were shown to be effective in extending the shelf life of the guavas as compared to the uncoated fruits, and were well accepted by the consumers throughout the whole period of the experiment and also in the specific sensory analyses. Of the coatings studied, the gelatin film containing triacetin was shown to be the best, both from the sensory and physicochemical characteristics studied. The incorporation of brightness due to the use of coatings had a favourable effect on the appearance. Coatings containing lauric acid, despite some positive aspects, influenced the typical flavour of the guavas. However, washing of the fruits before eating was sufficient to remove the off-flavour.</p>

Title: Manual for the preparation and sale of fruits and vegetables. From field to market
Author: A.F. López Camelo 
Source: FAODate: 2004The fruit and vegetable production sector of Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and Eastern Europe is facing a new situation where, on the one hand, supermarket chains account for an increasing percentage of the domestic food retail market and, on the other hand, producers must compete in an increasingly demanding global market for non- traditional and off-season fruits and vegetables. Producers with the necessary financial, management and technological skills are already meeting the new challenges; however, small farmers are increasingly being marginalized and will be facing unequal market conditions unless they are able to change their practices to meet the needs of a modern food marketing system. Regardless of the production system, the technological challenge is to increase returns through the rational use of available resources, reducing production costs and post-harvest losses, enhancing competitiveness and adding value to the final product. On the basis of these principles, this manual analyses the techniques for reducing post-harvest losses and ensuring quality and food safety from harvest to consumption. The new concept of quality involves ensuring total quality for increasing competitiveness and providing produce that better satisfies the demands of food retailers and, ultimately, the consumers.</p>

					<p> How training in simple food processing techniques can help village farmers successfully increase their incomes and improve the nutritional status of their families is described using the case of the Integration of Tree Crops into Farming Systems Project (ITFSP). The ITFSP is a regional project with activities in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe. In 1995, the project chose Kitui District, Kenya, as a pilot area because farmers had indicated that they had difficulties marketing fresh fruit and that a large part of the mango harvest rotted in their gardens. The main techniques introduced were wooden solar dryers, and jam and juice making. Local artisans were contracted to produce the dryers. In only 2 years, ITFSP has reached out to 27 farmer groups with a total membership of 680 farmers. A cost-benefit analysis of mango drying was performed using a variable number of drying days. The variation in gross margins per working day during the 1996/1997 season was assessed. Generally, the marketing of products is greatly enhanced when producer and marketing associations are formed.</p>
