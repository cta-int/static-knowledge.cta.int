They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>This OECD paper takes stock of available data on food waste and explores policies related to food waste in OECD countries. The authors, Morvarid Bagherzadeh and colleagues, show patterns in and the scale of food waste throughout the supply chain which so far remain poorly understood, despite growing media coverage and public concerns in recent years. They argue that better understanding of these patterns could contribute to abating interlinked sustainability challenges such as food security, climate change and water shortage. &nbsp; &nbsp;(OECD, 21/12/2014) &nbsp;<b>Download the OECD report</b></p>

					<p>Knowledge of the magnitude of postharvest losses (PHL) in sub-Saharan Africa is limited. Hippolyte Affognona, of ICIPE, Nairobi, Kenya and colleagues conducted a meta-analysis to expose the nature and magnitude of PHL, and the kinds of interventions that have been attempted to mitigate the losses. Their findings reveal inadequacies of loss assessment methodologies that result in inaccurate PHL estimates. Moreover, losses are often economic rather than physical product losses. Overall, technologies for loss mitigation fail to address the dynamics of supply chains. &nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>World Development</i>, 31/08/2014)</p>

					<p>Around a quarter of total food wastage in developing countries could be eliminated if these countries adopted the same level of refrigeration equipment as that in developed economies according to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IME), London, UK. Establishing a continuous chain of temperature-controlled cold environments from the point of harvest to the marketplace and on into the home â€“ a â€˜cold chainâ€™ â€“ is required. The challenge for the engineering profession is to do this in a way which minimises food wastage, is sustainable and avoids harmful emissions and air pollutants. In summary, engineers need to help establish sustainable and resilient infrastructure, fit for purpose in the local context. Two elements are important; firstly, projects need to be affordable; secondly they must be safe, reliable, easy to build, operate and maintain. &nbsp;&nbsp;(FoodProduction daily.com, 30/06/2014)</p>

					<p>Food and Nutrition Security Information (FNSI) is a critical tool for achieving food and nutrition security, yet FNSI efforts to date have not produced the intended &nbsp;impacts on policy and programme decision making, largely due to shortcomings in available technologies and frameworks. This article by Nancy Mock and &nbsp;colleagues from Tulane University reviews the evolution of FNSI efforts in the context of emerging technology and data collection techniques. A conceptual framework &nbsp;is provided to describe the evolution towards an FNSI characterised by integrating conventional and novel approaches to the collection, analysis and communication &nbsp;of information into a value stream that supports decision making to achieve food security. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211912412000351?np=y" target="_self">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211912412000351?np=y</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Global Food Security</i>, Vol. 2 Iss. 1, 01/03/2013) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Two recent working papers by the World Resources Institute (WRI) are the first in a new series leading to the <i>World Resources Report 2013-14: Creating a Sustainable Food Future</i>. One paper, â€˜The great balancing actâ€™ assesses the scope of the challenge posed by the need to feed a growing population in the near-future while reducing pressure on the environment. Priorities and solutions must focus on poverty alleviation, gender, ecosystems, climate and water, it argues. Another paper, â€˜Reducing food loss and wasteâ€™, explains how efforts to reduce postharvest losses and waste perform against each of the sustainable food future criteria. It offers a thorough overview of waste and loss problems and severity and it describes how changes at the level of the value chain â€“ some still to be researched and put into practice â€“ can create immediate benefits to society and the environment.(WRI, 01/07/2013)</p>

					<p>The Agriculture and Food Security Network of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation has conducted a quantitative survey with 105 farmers in Benin to study the storage &nbsp;techniques used for dry grains and the main problems encountered during storage. It investigates in more depth the issue of storage losses, their causes and means of improving food &nbsp;conservation in the long term. 59% of the producers of dry grains interviewed reported difficulties in bridging their household needs for dry grains until the next harvest. Producers believe just &nbsp;over half of the food produced by a rural household should be sufficient to prevent hunger among the rural population. Weevils (Sitophilus spp) and other insect pests are responsible for &nbsp;78.5% of losses. Key issues are the poor availability of storage facilities and suitable packaging material and the lack of pest management knowledge. The document also explores &nbsp;management methods the countryâ€™s extension system is promoting.(SDC Food security, 06/2013)</p>

					<p>Three different cultivars of drought, salt and boron tolerant <i>Opuntia ficus indica</i> (Cactus pear) were grown in poor-quality agricultural drainage sediment high in salt, boron and selenium that originated from the Westside San Joaquin Valley, US. Nutritional contents were then measured in these Cactus pear fruit, and vegetative cladodes compared to the same cultivars grown adjacent on a low saline sandy loam soil. After harvesting fruit and cladodes, the mineral nutrients status were analyzed. The results demonstrated positive nutritional changes in both cladodes and fruit within the Cactus pear cultivars when grown on agricultural drainage sediment compared to those grown on normal soil. Under these conditions Cactus pear plants contained nutraceutical qualities and represent a useful anticarcinogenic selenium-enriched chemotherapeutic food crop for providing advanced dietary seleno-pharmacology in order to help fight human diseases.

					<p>This IIED <a href="http://pubs.iied.org/16509IIED.html" target="_blank">briefing paper</a> examines the potential for branding agricultural commodities in developing countries. It looks at how producers in these countries can exploit the same commercial marketing principles and supply chain innovations commonly used in the mature markets of the developed world. Modern food chains place increasing importance on branding, distribution and services â€“ activities â€˜downstreamâ€™ of farmersâ€™ traditional role in supplying produce to markets. As a result, primary producers of agricultural commodities have been capturing less and less of the total value of their products. By branding commodities, producer countries and organisations can reverse this growing imbalance. Branding creates consumer demand, giving producers leverage in negotiations with major buyers.

					<p>Sugar mills produce a range of by-products during the process of sugar extraction. Mill mud is one of the by-products produced in significant volume. The practice of spreading mill mud over nearby cane fields has been the primary means of disposing of mill mud for many years. The continued application of mill mud at high rates, without appropriate recognition of its nutrient content, the soil condition, crop nutrient requirements, slope and proximity of application sites to environmentally sensitive areas has raised a number of concerns in recent years, including over-fertilization, heavy metal contamination, leaching, and offsite impacts from drainage to waterways. <a href="http://purl.umn.edu/125149" target="_blank">This study</a> (presented at the 2002 conference of the Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society) develops a regional mathematical programming model to determine optimal rates of mill mud application for various soil types and distances from the mill in central Queensland, Australia. </p>

In 2007 (the latest year for which comprehensive estimates are available), the private sector spent $19.7 billion on food and agricultural research (56 percent in food manufacturing and 44 percent in agricultural input sectors) and accounted for about half of total public and private spending on food and agricultural R&amp;D in high-income countries. In R&amp;D related to biofuel, annual private-sector investments are estimated to have reached $1.47 billion worldwide by 2009. Incentives to invest in R&amp;D are influenced by market structure and other factors. Agricultural input industries have undergone significant structural change over the past two decades, with industry concentration on the rise. A relatively small number of large, multinational firms with global R&amp;D and marketing networks account for most R&amp;D in each input industry. Rising market concentration has not generally been associated with increased R&amp;D investment as a percentage of industry sales.</p>

					<p><i>Lemma, T., et al. Improving Productivity and Market of Ethiopian Farmers (IPMS) Working Paper 29. 2012.</i>Graduate Programs in agriculture and allied disciplines in Ethiopia are expected to make concrete contributions towards achieving market-led and knowledge-based transformation of smallholder agriculture. Hence, strengthening capacities of graduate programmes and attracting policy attention is crucial. This paper discusses key challenges of the graduate programmes to realize their mandates and to meet ever changing expectations. It also presents a case study linking graduate programmes through research by students to commodity value chain development and actors, and discusses qualitative and quantitative indicators of outcome in terms of enhanced research and learning experience. The paper draws out some lessons and identifies strategic and practical options that may help to improve learning and research in the graduate programmes.<a href="http://mahider.ilri.org/handle/10568/16385" target="_self">http://mahider.ilri.org/handle/10568/16385</a> </p>

<i>Coles, C. 2011. Kilimanjaro and Oromia Coffee Value Chain Case Studies: Producer Benefits from Fair Trade and Free Market Channels. NCCR North-South Dialogue, 34. Bern, Switzerland: NCCR North-South.</i>As part of a transversal research project exploring coffee value chains in Tanzania, Ethiopia and Kenya, this <a href="http://www.north-south.unibe.ch/content.php/publication/id/2642 " target="_blank">study</a> conducted by Christopher Coles from the NCCR North-South (National Centre of Competence in Research â€“ North-South Research Partnership for Sustainable Development) in Bern, Switzerland, traced Fair Trade and open market coffee value chains in Kilimanjaro Region, Tanzania and in the Jimma Region, Ethiopia. Its objective is to identify factors that affect how intended Fair Trade benefits can be attenuated by political and social institutions at different levels in their translation into the everyday realities for coffee farmers. It compares the governance frameworks and benefit distribution among actors in both chains and makes insightful recommendations for policy changes in order to maximise returns for smallholder farmers.</p>
