They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>The SENSE project (Harmonised Environmental Sustainability in the European food and drink chain) brings together researchers, producers, transformers and distributors in order to achieve a harmonised, integral methodology that can be used to evaluate the environmental impact of food products accurately and efficiently. The project SENSE (7th FP) aims to contribute towards getting the food and drink sector to engage in more environmentally sustainable production, transformation and distribution of its products. The current situation presses the need to have tools that will help to reduce the environmental impact of food and drink throughout their production chain, starting with their production and transformation and going right up to their commercial distribution. The SENSE members will be focusing specifically on creating a methodology applied to the juice, dairy, meat and aquaculture sectors, chosen for their importance in the European market.

					<p>The Post-harvest-Compendium describes issues of paramount importance to post-harvest operations or post-production activities for staple foods and edible crops. The Post-harvest-Compendium is designed to be used through the Internet: to provide technical and updated information about how, when and what is done after production of the crops in different communities around the world. It also provides information on other aspects associated with post-harvest activities. These include crop and family labour, tools and basic equipment involved in production and postproduction, main causes of losses, pest control, socio-economic issues, gender issues, commercialisation, nutritional value, processing techniques, by-products, product quality and so forth. Several chaptersâ€™ related to specific crops and specific post-harvest information are currently in preparation by crops expert under the supervision of recognised institutions such as IRRI, CIAT, INDDA, APCC, and others. This information will provide global support to post-harvest activities, and will improve food security in the future.</p>

					<p>CABI | 2010-02-08 | ISBN: 1845936469 | 320 pagesThe transportation and storage of fresh fruits and vegetables is an international operation where technology must be used to ensure that produce reaches the consumer in the best possible condition. The use of controlled atmosphere storage has great potential to reduce the postharvest use of chemicals, maintain nutritional quality and organoleptic characteristics and reduce physical losses. This revised edition incorporates the latest research to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of controlled and modified atmosphere storage. Chapters review the history of the technique, the range of conditions and technologies currently in use for different produce and their effect on flavour, quality and physiology. In addition, the influence of pests and diseases, environmental factors and packaging and aspects of controlled atmosphere transport are considered in detail as well as a synthesis of recommendations for a wide range of crops.</p>

					<p><i><b>Cutting waste food to feed the world</b></i><b>By the Swedish Institute for Food and Biotechnology for the FAO, May 2011.</b><a href="http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ags/publications/GFL_web.pdf" target="_blank">This document</a> was commissioned by the FAO from the Swedish Institute for Food and Biotechnology (SIK) for <i>Save Food!,</i> an international congress held in May 2011 at the trade fair of the international packaging industry <i>Interpack2011</i>. <a href="http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/74192/icode/" target="_blank">Key findings</a> include: 


Industrialized and developing countries fool away roughly the same quantities of food â€“ respectively 670 and 630 million tonnes. 

Every year, consumers in rich countries waste almost as much food (222 million tonnes) as the entire net food production of sub-Saharan Africa (230 million tonnes). 

Fruits and vegetables, plus roots and tubers have the highest wastage rates of any food. 

The amount of food lost or wasted every year is equivalent to more than half of the world's annual cereals crop (2.3 billion tonnes in 2009/2010). 


The report distinguishes between food loss and food waste. Food losses â€“ occurring at the production, harvest, post-harvest and processing phases â€“ are most important in developing countries, due to poor infrastructure, low levels of technology and low investment in the food production systems. A separate report on food packaging for developing countries, also prepared for the Save Food! Congress, noted that appropriate packaging is a key factor impacting on losses occurring at almost every stage of the food chain.Related and of interest to this issue is the <a href="../../S-T-Policy/Foresighting/Relevant-publications/Foresight.html" target="_blank"><i>Foresight 2011.

					<p><i><b>Dealing with small scale producers: Linking buyers and producers</b></i>This 2011 publication by the Royal Tropical Institute (the Netherlands) focuses on the potential benefits of collaboration, along the value chain, between the private sector and the small scale producers. It argues that producer organisations, who usually coordinate and maintain the relationship between both parties, donâ€™t play the role they could to enhance cooperation and collaboration in the relationship. The great diversity in producer organisations is also reflected in their capacities; consequently, there is confusion about which form of organisation is appropriate for a particular business aim. This publication aims to contribute to the understanding of producer organisations and the potential benefit they can bring to enhancing particular business relationships.Young professionnals in ARD have been disucssing this matter for the last few month.

					<p><i>NEPAD, African Ministerial Council on Science and Technology</i>One of the sources of food insecurity in Africa is post harvest crop loss. In African countries pre and post-harvest crop losses are higher than the global average and impact more severely on already endangered livelihoods. It has been estimated that at least 10 percent of the continentâ€™s crop productivity is lost on and off farm. This is mainly because most subsistence farming communities to do not have access to appropriate technologies. A wide range of existing food processing technologies is not accessible to and adapted by African countries and their communities. Climatic conditions also contribute to crop losses. Floods, heavy rains, droughts and other related factors cause considerable post harvest crop loss.</p>

					<p>While increased productivity is an essential component to a vibrant agricultural sector, improved post-harvest handling and processing is essential to ensure high-quality products reach markets. Too often, even when yields are high, producers lose income due to poor post-harvest practices.CNFA's strategy is designed to increase both productivity and crop quality and to build an efficient infrastructure for post-harvest handling, storage and marketing in order to extend the sales season and help farmers obtain optimum returns on their crops investments. CNFA promotes the use of best practices in post-harvest techniques and procedures, such as conditioning, washing/sorting/grading, immediate cooling or cold storage and controlled atmosphere. CNFA also provides training in business planning, including strategic sales and marketing plans. It is critical to select, cultivate and market high-value crops in order to raise incomes and establish a viable and competitive agricultural economy. Using a combination of technical assistance and small grants to help introduce competitive practices and technologies, CNFA has fostered the expansion of high-value agriculture, driven by market demands and opportunities. CNFA works with enterprises within targeted value chains to help identify the best long-term strategies for expanding markets, increasing capacity, generating investment, empowering entrepreneurs and increasing rural incomes. This can include introducing new crop varieties or applying new production technologies, including intensive production techniques, advanced and efficient irrigation systems, use of GIS/remote sensing in production planning and high-productivity genetics. Projects emphasize future opportunities for investment or assistance within that sector and the competitive advantages within the market. One way for entrepreneurs to access higher-value markets is securing special certifications. CNFA helps local partners to institutionalize quality management programs and introduce international quality standards (ISO, HACCP) and to develop and market new products, brands, and Seal of Quality programs.</p>

					<p><i>Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Bridgetown, BARBADOS September 1988</i>The main objective of this manual is to describe how post-harvest handling and marketing can be improved through better packaging. Inter-regional exports of the English speaking independent countries in the Eastern Caribbean amount to more than 60,000 tonnes of produce traded, valued at some EC$ 90 million per year. If we assume a 20 percent loss, the economical loss caused by post-harvest losses could well be over EC$ 18 million every year. Consequently, reducing these losses with only one percent results in the marketability of an extra 600 tonnes of produce valued at EC$ 1 million every year in the regional markets. Total world fresh produce exports in 1986 were estimated at US$ 226,505 million. A loss of one percent equals a financial loss of US$ 227 million. Only a small part of the world production of agricultural produce is exported and according to FAO estimates post-harvest losses were in the order of 20 - 33% of all food produced. A small reduction in post-harvest losses will result in lower financial losses and in an increased availability of food. Other financial losses such as loss of market opportunities, loss of quality, loss of goodwill, etc. can also result in a financial loss for the trader or farmer.</p>

	The Post-Harvest and Value Addition Group works on durable and perishable crops after harvest to reduce losses, enhance financial or nutritional crop-value, and assure food safety. Research ranges from the fundamentals of storage and preservation of quality throughout the marketing chain, to food-science aspects of agro-processing and responses of consumers to new food products. The teamâ€™s research strategy includes: use of refined behavioural analysis techniques in studies of insect pests of grain, to identify new options for pest management without synthetic pesticides; studies of food safety in the informal food sector of developing countries, to improve quality and safety in a sector vital for employment of poor people; investigating food and energy security to improve sustainability of rural livelihoods in semi-arid developing countries reliant on renewable natural resources; and developing optimum approaches for uptake of post-harvest value-addition in cassava (supported by Gates Foundation) and bio-fortified food crops (with HarvestPlus Challenge Program).</p>

					<p><i>United Nation University Press, Food and Nutrition Bulletin</i>Some of the world's harvests of food crops and food fish, inevitably, never reach what the technologists in the field of post-harvest food conservation call the food-preparation stages. Bad harvest timing, inefficient machinery, carelessness, rats, insects, moulds, bacteria, contaminants, heat, cold, moisture, and lack of moisture continue to cut into the harvests. The expert group that determined the priorities of the United Nations University's World Hunger Programme in 1975 concluded that the problem of post-harvest food conservation was not receiving sufficient attention from established international and bilateral agencies. They recommended that it be one of the three sub-programmes of the World Hunger Programme. A new 215-page study, <i>Post-harvest Food Losses in Developing Countries</i>, just completed by a committee of the United States National Research Council, concludes that &quot;post-harvest food losses are 'enormous'.&quot; Yet, the report says, &quot;we do not ... know what proportion of the post-harvest losses it is technically or economically feasible to reduce. Nor will we be in a position to assess this until systematic, co-ordinated efforts to estimate and reduce losses are implemented at national, regional, and local levels over a wide area.</p>

" alt="link">Post-harvest handling of horticultural produces a challenge to developing countries. </a></h2>

	
					<p><i>Acta Horticultura </i>369: 40-46, 1994<i>.</i>Post-harvest handling links the crop and the consumer in such a way to benefit the producer and the consumer as well. In this matter, the challenge to developing countries depends mainly on how far they can develop political will to create good business environment, build the infrastructure, the needed facility, good practice and management. The success of Kenya and Thailand in the development of horticultural crops, including post-harvest handling technology, is mainly due to the creation of good business environment and hardship through consistent and continuous efforts. The challenge becomes more important due to the horticultural produce susceptibility, the increasing awareness on quality, and the tougher competition among the nations. Cleaning, grading, packing, storage and transporting horticultural produce are still significant problems to those involved in handling them. Improvement program on post-harvest terminals may reduce or even overcome the problems of post-harvest handling for a developing country.</p>

					<p>Fresh fruits and vegetables are inherently perishable. During the process of distribution and marketing, substantial losses are incurred which range from a slight loss of quality to total spoilage. Postharvest losses may occur at any point in the marketing process, from the initial harvest through assembly and distribution to the final consumer. The causes of losses are many: physical damage during handling and transport, physiological decay, water loss, or sometimes simply because there is a surplus in the marketplace and no buyer can be found!</p>

					<p>Through the postharvest research and extension programs of 11 Extension Specialists, relevant information is provided to California growers, shippers, marketers, carriers, distributors, retailers, processors, and consumers of fresh horticultural crops. The Centre is housed in the Department of Plant Sciences at UC Davis. The mission of this organisation is to reduce postharvest losses and improve the quality, safety and marketability of fresh horticultural products. These are achieved by being a leading source of research-based information on the postharvest quality, safety and marketability of fresh horticultural products for the produce value chain; effectively communicating information and knowledge on postharvest technology that enhances the quality, safety and marketability of fresh horticultural products; catalyzing innovative and enhanced collaboration among centre members, industry, government, and other academic institutions, nationally and internationally; and finally, being financially self-sustaining.</p>
