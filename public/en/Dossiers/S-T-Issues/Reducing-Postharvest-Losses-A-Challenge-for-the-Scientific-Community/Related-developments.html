They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	The EC wants to improve the quality labelling system it uses to designate traditional agricultural produce and foods. The system helps protect and promote the brand names of Europeâ€™s traditional agricultural produce and foods. Since its creation in 1992, the system has registered products under one of three labels (Protected Designations of Origin; Protected Geographical Indications; Traditional Specialities Guaranteed). The Commission made legislative proposals in December 2010 called &quot;<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/quality/policy/quality-package-2010/index_en.htm" target="_blank">Quality package 2010</a>&quot; to streamline the system and make the labels easier to use and understand.The Quality Package puts in place a comprehensive policy on certification schemes, value-adding terms for agricultural product qualities, and product standards, covering the different facets of quality, from the compliance with minimum standards to the production of highly specific products. The Package comprises a new 'Agricultural Product Quality Schemes Regulation', a new general base-line â€˜Marketing Standardâ€™ for all agricultural products and new â€˜Guidelines of best practicesâ€™ on voluntary certification schemes. For the future, the Commission announced its intention to study further the problems faced by small-scale producers in participating in Union quality schemes as well as mountain producers to market their products.For ACP farmers and food producers, national or regional quality standards could help them market their products abroad. The initiative by the EC could set a baseline for quality certification process and serve ACP countries in their effort to expand exports of agricultural produce of accredited quality. However, ACP countries would need to improve the human and physical infrastructure to take advantage of the opportunities.(Source: EC ARD website, 15 Feb. 2011)</p>

	The biggest challenge in Papua New Guinea is accessing the knowledge and technologies for developing possible products from sweet potato that can be sold on the local markets. Sweet potato has not been accorded the importance it deserves in the peopleâ€™s diets despite the fact that it is produced and consumed in large quantities and has nutritional and economic value. There is a need to consider alternative ways for farmers to use their surplus sweet potatoes. To address some of these issues, a sweet potato food fair was held on 3 February 2011 at the Anglimp South Wagi District Administration office in Minj, Jiwaka Province, PNG. The food fair was funded under the auspices of ACIAR (Australia) funded project.(Source: PNG NARI, 14 Feb. 2011).</p>

Farmers in Jamaica have started to grow turmeric on test plots around the country with the help of the ministry of agriculture's export division. The plant grows wild in Jamaica, especially in western parishes, but this is the first time a concerted effort has been made to cultivate it for the US$ 133 million export market. Tests show that Jamaican turmeric contains at least 4 % curcumin, the chemical that gives the spice its yellow colour (the market-leading Indian turmeric is at 5 %). Turmeric is mainly used for colouring and mixed with other spices to make curry powder. Curcuma is a powerful antioxidant.

Surprisingly, the steers used in the study were not picky eaters as they widely accepted the algal residue in a processed form. The algae co-product is what is left-over after oil extraction and is in powder form.

The current situation presses the need to have tools that will help to reduce the environmental impact of food and drink throughout their production chain, starting with their production and transformation and going right up to their commercial distribution. The SENSE members will be focusing specifically on creating a methodology applied to the juice, dairy, meat and aquaculture sectors, chosen for their importance in the European market.

An article explaining how Africanised bees enabled the revival of Trinidad and Tobagoâ€™s honey production. Africanised bees which many feared would have destroyed the country's beekeeping industry (because they colonized the island and overtook the European beesâ€™ habitat) have instead helped put Trinidad and Tobago on the map as having the best honey in the world. Trinidadâ€™s honey is regarded as being of very high quality, having won the top prize in two international competitions. Early 2001, the industry lost its impetus when new European Union regulations stipulated that honey must be tested in laboratories before it enters the European market. Numerous petitions were made to set up laboratories so that Trinidad and Tobago could again sell its prized honey in international markets. Presently the demand for honey is greater than the supply, and the local industry churns out an estimated three tonnes of honey every season. But to stimulate honey production so that the growing demands for honey are met, the Trinidad and Tobago Beekeepers Association have asked the ministry of Food Production, Land and Marine Affairs for access to forested areas to set up apiaries.(Source: Trinidad Express, 27 October 2010.)</p>

					<p>Breadfruit (<i>Artocarpus altilis</i>) is a high-yielding underutilized food-crop that grows in abundance in many tropical nations that struggle with malnutrition, including Haiti, the Philippines and India. It's high in carbohydrates, very high-yielding and requires few agricultural inputs. Because breadfruit has such a short shelf-life, most breadfruit goes uneaten, even in extremely malnourished communities. Compatible Technology International (CTI) has developed a set of manually-operated tools that rural villagers can use to preserve fresh breadfruit as gluten-free flour. The tools include a shredder, dryer and grinder. Breadfruit flour can be used in cookies, cakes, and many other products as a substitute or in addition to wheat flour, which is much more costly. In the fall of 2012, the breadfruit equipment will be thoroughly tested at the <a href="http://ntbg.org/breadfruit/" target="_self">Breadfruit Institute of the National Tropical Botanical Garden</a> in Hawaii. CTI will use the data collected at the Breadfruit Institute and in Haiti (a project using the tool) to help community enterprises form economically viable business models.(Via agro.biodiver.se, 8/2012)</p>

There is a need to add value to food production in Samoa to fully utilize local resources (agricultural produce), generate income, employment and reduce imports. There is also a need to exploit energy sources that are renewable to compact high energy cost. All research activities of the Organisation are geared to achieving these goals.SROS research on <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/sphs/sphr/2011/00000007/00000002/art00003" target="_self">postharvest disease management</a>, among other themes, has received international commend.</p>

					<p>The Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) hosted a meeting of the Pacific Plant Protection Organization (PPPO), a regional plant protection organisation recognised by the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC), and a Regional Technical Meeting of Plant Protection (RTMPP) to discuss phytosanitary issues including pest and disease control, quarantine measures, international trade and implementation of international standards. PPPO and RTMPP provide guidance on issues relating to plant protection, biosecurity and trade-related phytosanitary issues for Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) and ensure that biosecurity requirements of PICTs comply with international standards to facilitate regional and international trade.(Excerpt from ISSD SIDS Policy and Practice, 29/6/2012)<a href="http://sids-l.iisd.org/news/pacific-community-holds-consultations-on-phytosanitary-matters/" target="_blank">http://sids-l.iisd.org/news/pacific-community-holds-consultations-on-phytosanitary-matters/</a></p>

					<p>Agri-ProFocus (APF) is a partnership with Dutch roots that promotes farmer entrepreneurship in developing countries. The partnership was founded in 2005 with the aim of rallying together professionals, expertise and resources around a joint interest in farmer entrepreneurship. The Agri-ProFocus network members are organisations and companies that gather, train, connect and provide inputs and credit to farmer entrepreneurs and producer organisations.The network operates both at a Dutch (-based) level and at a developing country level, the latter in so-called Agri-Hubs. By promoting entrepreneurship and connecting producers with national and international markets, Agri-ProFocus members aim to both open up market potential for business in developing countries.<a href="http://www.agri-profocus.nl/" target="_self">http://www.agri-profocus.nl/</a></p>

					<p><i>Telfairia occidentalis </i>is an indigenous vegetable consumed by millions of people in Nigeria. The seeds are in high demand as they serve as food oil for making margarine. However, commercial growers in the middle belt zone of Nigeria, source <i>telfairia</i> seeds from south-eastern states of Nigeria. The growers claimed that seeds of the accessions grown in the area are not as viable as those from southeast Nigeria. Thus, seeds are scarce and expensive at time of planting. This survey sought to examine farmersâ€™ perception of diversity and determine the status of fluted pumpkin production as a basis for facilitating further studies, in order to help resolve the constraints to <i>telfairia</i> seed production. The results showed that the farmers, predominantly female (78%), were able to identify two cultivars â€˜Ugwu-eluâ€™ and â€˜Ugwu-alaâ€™ by their distinctive characteristics â€“ leaves, stem, fruit and seed. The crop was produced on low ridges, with two seeds planted in a hole about 6 cm deep, at a spacing of 31 x 45 cm, giving a population of approximately 71,700 plants/ha. Mulching and fertilizer use were not practised but weeding and irrigation were undertaken. Apparently, seed production is possible in Makurdi and breeders can breed for <i>telfairia</i> seed.(<i><a href="http://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajb/article/viewFile/58583/46924" target="_blank">African Journal of Biotechnology</a></i> Vol. 7, Is. 8, 17/04/2008)</p>
