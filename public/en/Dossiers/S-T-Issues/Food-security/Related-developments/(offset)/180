						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>The International Potato Center has launched a major project to leverage the untapped potential of sweetpotato to significantly improve the nutrition, incomes, and food production of farming families in sub-Saharan Africa, especially among impoverished women and children. The project, titled Sweetpotato Action for Security and Health in Africa (SASHA), will be implemented in eight Sub-Saharan African countries, and is supported by a five-year, $21 million grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. It is the largest of a group of grants presented by Bill Gates at the World Food Prize Symposium on October 15, 2009 in Des Moines, Iowa. The SASHA program will help set the groundwork for reducing malnutrition, combating vitamin A deficiency, and improving incomes for 10 million African households within 10 years.

					<p>With heavy rain already beginning to flood parts of East Africa, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has warned that further El Niño rains could compound the humanitarian crisis caused by drought. Kenya, Somalia, and Uganda are those most at risk of flooding, mudslides, crop destruction and water-borne diseases which could see up to 750,000 affected. But due to the severity of the drought, rains are desperately needed in order to prevent further crop failure and help pastures regenerate. For pastoralists, migration in search of water and pasture has exacerbated conflict and led to increased disease outbreaks. This, in turn, has killed a large number of livestock and reduced the market value of those still alive due to their poor physical condition. In addition, poor harvests due to the lack of rainfall have been compounded by high food prices. Twenty million people in the region are already dependent on food aid, but as the hunger season progresses, the UN warn that this number is likely to increase.

					<p>An international seed bank has reached its target of collecting 10% of the world's wild plants, with seeds of a pink banana among its latest entries. The wild banana, <i>Musa itinerans</i>, is a favourite of wild Asian elephants. Seeds from the plant, which is under threat from agriculture, join 1.7 billion already stored by Kew's Millennium Seed Bank partnership. The project has been described as an &quot;insurance strategy&quot; against future biodiversity losses. The seed bank partnership, which involves more than 120 organisations in 54 countries, is now aiming to collect and conserve seeds from a quarter of the Earth's flowering plant species by 2020. The 10% target was set when the Wakehurst Place facility in the UK was completed in 2000. The next step is to secure another 15%, so by 2020 a quarter of the world's seeds are banked in both the country of origin and Wakehurst Place. A major focus is going to be a considerable expansion in the sustainable use of seeds for human benefit. The researchers will be focusing on food security, biodiversity loss and climate change.

					<p>The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has launched a new project that aims to increase food security for smallholder farmers in dryland areas of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The project, Harnessing Opportunities for Productivity Enhancement (HOPE) of Sorghum and Millets in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, will be undertaken by 50 partners led by ICRISAT in ten countries of sub-Saharan Africa and four states in India. HOPE is supported by an $18 million, four-year grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. Through the development and delivery of improved crop varieties and training in crop management practices, HOPE will increase small-scale farmer yields by 35 to 40% during the first four years of the project. These improved varieties of sorghum and millet will be disseminated to 110,000 households in sub-Saharan Africa and 90,000 in South Asia. Within ten years, the project should benefit more than 2 million households in these continents. Scientists estimate that yields could be doubled or even tripled from their current low levels if farmers use the right crop varieties, fertilizer and other management techniques. Capturing even a modest portion of these potential gains would generate major impacts in reducing food insecurity. (Source: African Agriculture, 16 October 2009)</p>

					<p>Fish populations in the tropics could fall by as much as 40% over the next half century because of global warming, jeopardising a vital food source for the developing world, a new study published in the Global Change Biology journal has found. The waters off Indonesia - which rank among the most plentiful areas for fish today - could see supplies fall by well over 20% by 2055 because of changes in ocean conditions. Fishermen operating in US coastal waters (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) could also face large declines in fish stocks, as would those working off Chile and China. However, not all regions would be losers. Cooler climates would see their catch potential rise by between 30% and 70% by 2055, with Norway, Greenland, Alaska and the east coast of Russia seeing the biggest increases. While the overall productivity of the world's oceans will remain roughly the same, the sharp declines in fish stocks in Asia, the Caribbean, and semi-enclosed seas like the Mediterranean could cause severe shortfalls in some of the poorest regions of the world.

					<p>Drought-resistant maize varieties will be making their way from the greenhouse to the field as soon as South African scientists get the regulatory green light. The researchers at the University of Cape Town in South Africa have genetically engineered maize to contain four genes from the indigenous, desiccation-resistant <i>Xerophyta viscosa</i> plant — commonly known as the 'resurrection plant'. It has taken the research team five years to identify the genes that give <i>X. viscosa</i> its ability to withstand 95 percent dehydration, and transfer this genetic material into maize. The modified plant is expected to withstand environmental conditions that currently result in a greatly reduced harvest such as late rains. (Source: Scidev, 6 October 2009)</p>

					<p>At a time when failing harvests are once again threatening the lives and livelihoods of millions across Africa, 300 agriculture scientists, entrepreneurs, farmers’ organizations and governments from across the African continent gathered to accelerate a major new effort to develop and deploy higher-yielding, drought and disease-resistant crop varieties of Africa’s most important food crops. Despite the many challenges, in the past two years PASS grantees have demonstrated that the problems are far from insurmountable. Throughout Africa, demand for improved seed is high and growing. An assessment by AGRA earlier this year found that nearly all seed producers in 13 countries have sold 100 percent of their seed. Most indicated they could have sold more. In only two years, investments in 32 small and medium-sized seed companies and cooperatives have helped them double production, from 2,656 metric tons to 5,284 metric tons. PASS hopes to see these totals rise to 10,000 tons by the end of this year. (Source: AGRA-alliance, 5 October 2009)</p>

					<p>With the global population set to exceed 9 billion by 2050 and limited natural resources, food production needs to double if we are to provide food security. Innovation in agriculture will be central to finding ways to help farmers grow more food on less land. Crop protection products already help farmers to increase their yields per hectare and innovation in this area promises to further increase their efficacy. However, plant science companies invest significant amounts in many years of research to develop these products and without intellectual property protection, the incentive to invest in such innovation is severely diminished. Protection of safety and efficacy data along with data confidentiality is a key tool to foster this innovation. Javier Fernandez of CropLife Latin America explains the importance of protection of regulatory data and its relevance to the bid for food security.

	Researchers have linked poverty in sub-Saharan Africa with poor soil health, but two new Cornell studies find that the recommended practice of applying more fertilizer may not help the poorest farmers. Two new studies by Chris Barrett, Professor of Applied Economics and Management at Cornell, and Paswel Marenya, Ph.D. '08, a lecturer at the University of Nairobi, find flaws in the fertilizer-promotion strategy used by dozens of African countries to improve soil health, crop yields and the wealth of poor farmers. Forty African heads of state had devised plans in 2006 to help farmers in sub-Saharan Africa -- one of the poorest regions of the world where soils are often too degraded to reliably grow crops -- get better access to soil-enhancing fertilizers by improving roads, increasing access to seasonal credit and improving farmer education on fertilizer use.

					<p>Against the backdrop of the mounting food insecurity, as a result of the drought ravaging eastern, central and southern Africa, scientists are urging farmers to cultivate, and the people, to incorporate the soybean into their local diets to improve nutrition, generate income for themselves, and also to improve soil fertility. The soybean has the potential to not only meet the nutritional needs of the people, but also put some much needed money in the pockets of farmers and substantially transform their lives. It contains 40 per cent protein, a level much higher than in any other food crop or even livestock. It is made up of 20 per cent oil, and contains all the eight essential amino acids, making it the healthiest legume crop. Unfortunately, the crop’s rich potential is not well exploited in sub-Saharan Africa, where it is mostly seen as a cash crop. (Source: Africa Awake, 18 September 2009)</p>

					<p>While the world looks for signs that recession may be coming to an end, for the Kamasika Seed Growers Association of Zambia's Western Province, times are good. ‘Just last week we concluded a deal to supply 50 tonnes of maize seed for US$4200 to the Progen Seed Company,’ boasts Association chairman Mulele Mazeko. ‘We have also sold 8.6 tonnes of sorghum seed to a number of different buyers.’ For the first time, farmers in Zambia's poorest region are able to buy top quality seed, grown by local seed producers and certified by the province's new, state-run seed-testing laboratory in Mongu town. It is an extraordinary development in an area normally reliant on food aid. The Kamasika Seed Growers are just one of many groups to benefit from two EU-funded programmes operating in the province. The Right to Seed initiative, implemented by the NGO Self Help Africa, provided the spark for the growers. In 2004, three trainees from a seed multiplication course set up a cooperative to multiply high yielding varieties of maize, sorghum, groundnut and rice.

					<p>Data from the FAO show that there was an 18 percent increase in rice production in 2008 in Africa, compared to 2007 production levels. The African Rice Center (WARDA) says that increase was brought about by its member countries' adoption of key policy measures which were recommended by the Center in 2007. This contributed to an 18 percent increase in rice production in 2008 in Africa, compared to 2007 production levels, data from the Food and Agriculture organization show. Most notable is a 241 percent increase in Burkina Faso’s rice production in 2008 compared to 2007 levels. Burkina Faso was one of the countries rocked by food riots, following the shock increase in food prices in 2007. FAO attributes this turnaround in Burkina Faso’s rice fortunes to government support to farmers that ensured access to high quality certified rice seed, including NERICA® rice varieties developed by WARDA, and other basic farm inputs.

The agreement also forms part of the EU's Euro 1 billion, two-year assistance package being extended to ACP and Latin American countries, to help cushion the impact of the global food crisis and to achieve food sovereignty. The programme aims to reduce poverty and enhance the country's food security, by assisting small farmers to increase their productivity and, by extension, position the country to counter challenges associated with rising food prices.

					<p>A new rice plant has been developed which grows 'snorkels' when exposed to floods; the plant elongates rapidly in response to being submerged. Writing in Nature, Laurentius Voesenek of the Institute of Environmental Biology, Utrecht University, the Netherlands, describes how the Japanese scientists discovered the ‘snorkel’ genes in flood-tolerant rice, and introduced them to more sensitive high-yield rice. This finding could boost the production of rice in Asia and Africa, where up to 40% of crops are subject to flash floods or deep water.</p>

	The ongoing food crisis in Africa was a major theme at the 13th African Union summit, in Sirte, Libya, on 1-3 July 2009. UN Deputy Secretary-General Asha-Rose Migiro noted that the international community could well afford the extra $6-7 bn in aid needed annually to expand African agriculture. That amount, she said, is &quot;eminently feasible,&quot; especially when compared to the hundreds of billions mobilized by the industrialized countries to counter the global economic downturn. Ms. Rhoda Peace Tumusiime, the African Union's agriculture commissioner, called on member governments to process more farm products at home to generate jobs and incomes and develop integrated agricultural markets. African countries, she said, can also lessen their dependence on imported food by converting the $33 bn they spend annually to import food into rural investments instead.</p>

	The ‘famine food’ trees can keep drought-hit communities alive when all other food crops fail, says Miranda Spitteler of TREE AID. She argues that policy makers need to recognise the important role trees play in providing emergency food aid. Communities living in countries most affected by food shortages have long known about the key role that trees can play in reducing the need for food aid. However, smallholder farmers in rural Africa need support to adopt agro-forestry techniques, which boost soil fertility and provide tree food crops to supplement nutrition. Training and support can help villagers earn money from tree products. This approach can increase self sufficiency for both rural communities and national economies. It can increase environmental security, diversify livelihood options and reduce the vulnerability of poor households to climate change and external shocks.</p>

Leaders from the Group of Eight (G8) industrialized nations agreed July 10 2009 to commit around $20 billion over the next three years to helping the world's poorest countries develop their agricultural sectors. &quot;We welcome the commitments made by countries represented at <a href="http://www.cgiar.org/pdf/G8%20statement%20on%20food%20security%20july%202009.pdf" target="_self">L'Aquila</a> toward a goal of mobilising at least $20 billion [€14.3 billion] over three years,&quot; reads the <a href="http://www.agra-alliance.org/content/news/detail/966/" target="_self">declaration.</a> &quot;We are committed to increasing investments in short, medium and long-term agriculture development that directly benefits the poorest and makes best use of international institutions,&quot; it adds.
