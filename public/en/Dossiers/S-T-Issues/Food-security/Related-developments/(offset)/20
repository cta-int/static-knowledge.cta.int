						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Pigeonpea is one of the most popular sources of protein for many Kenyans living in drier regions. However, government officials have neglected pigeonpea and other pulses such as chickpeas and cowpeas, to the extent that they are often excluded from the Ministry of Agriculture reports. But, faced with climate change that threatens food security in Kenya, pigeonpea has gained significance and interest due to its ability to withstand drier climatic conditions. In this paper, Kennedy O. Pambo of the Department of Agricultural Economics of the University of Nairobi, has applied the commodity approach to agricultural marketing to describe the stages in the pigeonpea marketing system in Kenya. Pambo shows that farmers perform minimal farm gate processing to their produce since the market offers no premiums for it. Therefore, improving the market structure to reward value addition through simple processing would be important in creating employment as well as improving farm gate margins. &nbsp;&nbsp;(AgCom Search, June 2014)</p>

					<p>More consistent treatment of climate change adaptation is needed to inform assessments of the impacts of climate change and to more easily identify innovations in agriculture that are truly more effective in future climates than in current or past ones. At present, many potential changes in agricultural management and technology, including shifts in crop phenology and improved drought and heat tolerance, could help to improve crop productivity but do not necessarily represent true adaptations. In this article, David Lobell of Stanford University, USA, argues that such ‘adaptation illusions’ arise from a combination of faulty logic, model errors and the management of assumptions that ignore the farmers’ tendency to maximize profits for a given technology. He asserts that the concept of adaptation should be more consistently treated in order to better inform assessments of climate change impacts, and that agricultural innovations should be identified that are truly more effective in future climates than in current or past ones. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Global Food Security</i>, 25/6/2014)</p>

					<p>In discussions of the impacts of climate change on agriculture, it is often mistakenly argued that most of the expected impacts will occur toward the end of this century and that therefore most of the risks will have to be dealt with by future generations. In this article, Claudia Tebaldi, National Center for Atmospheric Research, USA, and David Lobell, Stanford University, USA, argue that the growth in demand for food is expected to be much slower after 2050 than before it, and that most of the growth will take place before 2050 – in the next two decades, in fact. They explain that smaller climate change impacts in the near future could have much greater consequences for food security and food prices than larger ones after 2050. They continue to argue that in the coming decade, global warming will substantially increase the chances that climate trends will cut yield growth rates to half, with a roughly 1 in 4 chance for maize and 1 in 6 chance for wheat. Although such scenarios may seem unlikely for many, the authors recommend further study, particularly by institutions that are potentially affected by associated steep rises in international food prices. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Environmental Research Letters</i>, Vol. 9 no. 7, July 2014)</p>

					<p>A team of researchers from the University of Georgia, U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute, Hudson Alpha Institute for Biotechnology, North Dakota State University and University of California Davis has recently released the genome sequence for the common bean – which includes a number of varieties that together rank as the world’s 10th most widely grown food crop. The new whole-genome sequencing will also help to identify genetic 'markers' that can be used to speed up breeding of new bean varieties in the United States, East Africa and other countries. All of the well-known bean varieties have the highly valued ability to form symbiotic relationships with 'nitrogen-fixing' bacteria in the soil. One of the goals of the sequencing project was to better understand the genetic basis on which symbiotic relationships between nitrogen-fixing plants and bacteria are formed and sustained. The new sequencing identified a handful of genes involved with moving nitrogen around, which could be helpful to farmers who intercrop beans with other crops that don’t fix nitrogen. The researchers also discovered dense clusters of genes related to disease resistance within the chromosomes. &nbsp;&nbsp;(UC Davis, 09/06/2014)</p>

	In this paper, Tara Garnett, of the Food Climate Research Network (FCRN, UK), considers the increasingly topical question of 'What is a sustainable healthy diet?' She begins by highlighting the rationale for focusing on the diets question, and then moves on to discussing definitions of ‘good nutrition’ on the one hand, and ‘sustainability’ on the other.&nbsp; The main substance of her argument focus on the major food groups that constitute UK’s Eat-well plate, examining the health and sustainability issues that their consumption raises.&nbsp; She also included a review of recent studies in this area. An important limitation of her paper is that it focuses largely on developed country contexts. Being a discussion paper, FCRN is looking for input from members in low income and emerging economies, where the sustainability and health issues play out very differently. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.fcrn.org.uk/fcrn/publications/fcrn-discussion-paper-what-sustainable-healthy-diet" target="_self">FCRN</a>, 04/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Andrew Leakey, plant biology professor at the University of Illinois, US, and colleagues report that levels of zinc, iron and protein drop in some key crop plants when grown at elevated CO2 levels. The teams simulated high CO2 levels in open-air fields using a system called Free Air Concentration Enrichment (FACE), which pumps out, monitors and adjusts ground-level atmospheric CO2 to simulate future conditions. The experiments revealed that the nutritional quality of a number of the world’s most important plants dropped in response to elevated CO2. Zinc and iron went down significantly in wheat, rice, field peas and soybeans. Wheat and rice also saw notable declines in protein content at higher CO2. Nutrients in millet, sorghum and maize remained relatively stable at higher CO2 levels because these crops use a type of photosynthesis, called C4, which already concentrates carbon dioxide in their leaves. &nbsp; &nbsp;(<a href="http://news.illinois.edu/news/14/0507CO2_AndrewLeakey.html" target="_self">University of Illinois</a>, 07/05/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>The Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) has produced a report on extrusion technology. Extrusion technology is central to value addition to agricultural commodities, especially cereals and legumes: it is a powerful process that combines several operations, including mixing, cooking, kneading, shearing, shaping, and forming. This high-temperature short-time (HTST) process usually reduces microbial contamination, inactivates enzymes, and facilitates the elimination of anti-nutrient factors, resulting in products that are in a dry state with typically low water activity, which do not require refrigeration storage. Several researchers in Africa have made considerable progress in product development using extrusion technology for the development and production of traditional-based products from indigenous materials. Extrusion has great potential in tropical developing economies where infrastructure for a cold supply chain is inadequate. &nbsp;&nbsp;Editor’s note: Cost effectiveness is a crucial issue in determining suitability of this technology. There must be a sufficient throughput&nbsp; of raw material to justify the investment. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.ift.org/food-technology/past-issues/2014/april/features/extrusioncooking.aspx?page=viewall" target="_self">IFT</a>, 04/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>In the study recently published in <i>Nature Communications</i>, researchers from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, US, led by Patricio Grassini, assistant professor in the Department of Agronomy and Horticulture, analysed the trends of crop yields over the past four decades in 36 countries and regions. The study suggests that previous predictions of yield gain have been overly optimistic and that, in fact, yields in some areas have already reached a plateau. However, while yield gains follow a linear upward trend, there are interruptions and changes over time and world regions. For some of the most productive areas around the world, yields have not increased for one or two decades and further steady gains in yield in these regions are unlikely. The researchers noted that such plateaus also occur at very low yields in some developing regions of the world. Citing the example of maize in sub-Saharan Africa, very low yield plateaus are not due to a biophysical limits (unlike wheat in Western Europe or rice in China), but to external obstacles. In these regions, there is more opportunity to increase yields through use of technology and smart public investment (see ACIAR publication above). Grassini and colleagues from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Wageningen University are currently working on a project called the Global Yield Gap Atlas. The project aims to estimate yield potential for cropping systems around the globe and compare potential yields to actual yields in order to estimate yield gaps. Mapping areas where the yield gap is large can help prioritise research and inform agricultural policies. &nbsp;&nbsp;Editor's note: We know that there is a yield gap in some regions and in other regions, countries have reached their optimum yield potential. Will the Global Atlas also tell us what are the existing technological options and financial investments needed for increasing productivity to provide nutritious food at affordable prices while ensuring that smallholder farmers can earn reasonable incomes? &nbsp;(<a href="https://www.crops.org/story/2014/apr/fri/predictions-of-lower-crop-yields-call-for-yield-gap-studies  " target="_self">Crop Science Society of America</a>, 25/04/2014) &nbsp;</p>

					<p>Michael Brüntrup, of the German Development Institute, writes about the ongoing debate on how to harness policy coherence for development (PCD) in Europe to improve food and nutrition security in poor countries. PCD enables the screening of the EU’s external and internal policies for their development implications, to help detect negative impacts and develop mitigation measures. According to Brüntrup, these screening exercises often fall short of expectations because of the contradictory internal interests behind EU policies. He points to the more fundamental problem with achieving PCD for African food security: the differential and often opposing impacts of a given EU policy for different target groups and for different circumstances. This makes an objective coherence judgment extremely difficult. Discussing the case of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and agricultural trade regime, he believes PCD in the area of food security is bound to remain patchy, and may be limited to addressing some particularly damaging side-effects of European policies only. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://africaeu2014.blogspot.be/2013/10/challenges-for-european-policy.html" target="_self">http://africaeu2014.blogspot.be/2013/10/challenges-for-european-policy.html</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(AfricaEU2014 blog, 16/10/2013)</p>

					<p>Humans who exhibit symptoms of lactose intolerance could be unable to digest A1, a protein most often found in milk from the high-producing Holstein cows favoured by American and some European industrial dairies. The A1 protein is much less prevalent in milk from Jersey, Guernsey, and most Asian and African cow breeds, where, instead, the A2 protein predominates. The difference between A1 and A2 proteins is subtle. The A2 variety of beta-casein mutated into the A1 version several thousand years ago in some European dairy herds. Two genes code for beta-casein, so modern cows can either be purely A2, A1/A2 hybrids, or purely A1. Milk from goats and humans contains only the A2 beta-casein, yet not everyone likes the flavour of goat milk, which also contains comparatively less vitamin B-12 – a nutrient essential for creating red blood cells. &nbsp;Editor’s note: Another reason to promote local breeds for dairy production? Consumer adoption of dairy products in developing countries could well be determined by the content of A2 protein. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/03/a1-milk-a2-milk-america" target="_self">http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/03/a1-milk-a2-milk-america</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>Mother Jones</i>, 12/03/2014)</p>

					<p>W. Akinyi Nyonje and colleagues from the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Nairobi, Kenya, conducted a series of experiments to determine the phytochemical and anti-nutrient content of ten amaranth (<i>Amaranthus</i> spp.) varieties at two growth stages, before and after flowering. Amaranth vegetable is widely consumed in Kenya and contributes to the alleviation of food insecurity. It is reported to have bioactive components such as antioxidants that help in protecting the body from long-term degenerative diseases. However, amaranth vegetable has also been shown to contain some anti-nutrients which may bind nutrients and reduce their bioavailability in the body. Results showed significant differences in the phytochemical and anti-nutrient content among the varieties and at the different harvest stages. As the plants matured, the anti-nutrient content increased. The anti-nutrient activity also increased with maturity, from vegetative to post-flowering stage. It is recommended that amaranth leaves be consumed before flowering as they have generally lower anti-nutrients. Among the ten varieties, <i>A. cruentus</i> had the lowest anti-nutrients and the highest phytochemicals concentrations. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jas/article/view/33443" target="_self">http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jas/article/view/33443</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Journal of Agricultural Science</i>, 03/2014)</p>

					<p>The Koga irrigation scheme in Ethiopia was finalised in May 2012 and more than 10,000 households residing in the irrigation scheme have started year-round crop production. Because many farmers in Koga irrigation scheme are new to irrigated vegetable crops production and post harvest handling practices, they do not know how to produce and process seeds of different vegetable crops and thus need to purchase imported seed from local private vegetable seed retailers. This situation posed a number of issues. The quantity of each imported seed package is too much for what the farmers require and the price of packed vegetable seeds is often too expensive for most smallholders. On top of this, most farmers do not have adequate knowledge and skills to raise and manage vegetable seedlings. This situation is creating a favourable environment for small entrepreneurs to raise and market vegetable seedlings in the area in the way that's practical and affordable for the scheme's smallholders. These local businesses create trust among farmers and input suppliers, often serving as alternative extension service providers with their expertise as seedling producers. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://lives-ethiopia.org/2014/01/15/vegetable_seedlings/" target="_self">http://lives-ethiopia.org/2014/01/15/vegetable_seedlings/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(LIVES Ethiopia, 15/01/2014)</p>

					<p>Hiroshi Masuda and colleagues from the Research Institute for Bioresources and Biotechnology in Japan describe seven transgenic approaches, and combinations thereof, that can be used to increase the concentration of iron (Fe) in rice seeds. Approaches examined by the scientists include the enhancement of the Fe storage capacity of grains through expression of the Fe storage protein ferritin, the introduction of the barley genes to enhance Fe uptake and translocation within plants, the enhancement of Fe translocation by overproducing the natural metal chelator nicotianamine. They also examined a number of combinations of the different approaches. All individual or combined approaches have the potential to further increase the Fe concentration of rice seeds. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thericejournal.com/content/6/1/40" target="_self">http://www.thericejournal.com/content/6/1/40</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>The Rice Journal</i>, 19/12/2013)</p>

					<p>The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) is testing a new rice fortification technique in Bangladesh to enrich it with the vital nutrient zinc. While zinc fortified fertiliser is available, only 30-40% of farmers use it, and 70-80% of zinc fertiliser is of sub-par quality. In rice’s journey from farm to fork, milling and polishing also removes the zinc from rice. As the most consolidated part of the farm-to-fork process, mills have the greatest potential reach. This is where GAIN is exploring increasing the nutrient density of rice through ‘fortifying at soak’. Fortifying at soak is the process of adding micronutrients to the water rice soaks in at the mill. By adding nutrients to the soaking water the rice absorbs the nutrient directly into the grain avoiding the removal of the nutrients during milling and polishing. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/gain-partner-zone/gallery/2014/mar/13/rice-fortification-in-pictures" target="_self">http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/gain-partner-zone/gallery/2014/mar/13/rice-fortification-in-pictures</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>The Guardian</i>, 18/03/2014)</p>

					<p>The African Orphan Crops Consortium, which includes the University of California, UC Davis, Mars Inc. and other global partners, released the names of the 100 African crop species whose genomes it plans to sequence, assemble and annotate to improve the nutrition of African farm families. The list of these 100 species, developed by African scientists, is being released so that researchers around the world can contact the consortium with suggestions for research needs regarding the selected species. The crop list, which includes the African eggplant, amaranth and the spider plant, is available at the <a href="http://www.mars.com/global/african-orphan-crops.aspx" target="_self">consortium’s website</a>. The first orphan crop to be studied will be baobab, because its fruit has antiviral properties and other health benefits, ten times the antioxidant level of oranges, twice the amount of calcium as spinach, three times the vitamin C of oranges and four times more potassium than bananas. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id=10804" target="_self">http://news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id=10804</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(UC Davis, 17/01/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Cissé Ibrahima and colleagues from the Institut National d'Hygiène Publique (INHP, Côte d'Ivoire) and CIRAD, studied the biochemical characteristics of the fruit pulp of five endemic baobab species from Madagascar and one from Côte d’Ivoire. Contents in vitamin C, polyphenols, lipids, proteins and minerals were evaluated. Comparing the results for each species, the researchers found high variability in biochemical characteristics and mineral content between the various species. None of them could be identified as a clear all-round winner. To date, despite the baobab fruit's nutritional importance, the lack of knowledge on pulp preservation causes loss. Future research should focus on increasing the pulp storage time while preserving its nutrition value. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.academicjournals.org/journal/AJAR/article-abstract/D9364B442110" target="_self">http://www.academicjournals.org/journal/AJAR/article-abstract/D9364B442110</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>African Journal of Agricultural Research</i>, 12/11/2013) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>A new study of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA, Austria), published in the journal <i>Global Change Biology,</i> demonstrates that a growing imbalance between phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizer use in Africa would lead to crop yield reductions of nearly 30% by 2050. Underuse of phosphorus-based fertilizers in Africa currently contributes to a growing yield gap – the difference between how much crops could produce in ideal circumstances compared to actual yields. This phosphorus-specific yield gap currently lies at around 10% for subsistence farmers, but will grow to 27% by 2050 if current trends continue. While nitrogen-based fertilizer usage has begun to increase in Africa in the last 10 years, the application of phosphorus to cropland has not kept pace, leading to a growing imbalance between nitrogen and phosphorus levels in soil. The new study shows that increases in nitrogen and phosphorus inputs must happen in a way that provides crops with the balanced nutrient input they need. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/news/20140128-phosphorus-africa.html" target="_self">http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/news/20140128-phosphorus-africa.html</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(IIASA, 28/01/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
