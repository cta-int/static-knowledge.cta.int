						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	The European Commission has given the green light to an ambitious research project called SUNRAY: the acronym for 'Sustainable Nutrition Research for Africa in the Years to come'. The project will be implemented by a consortium of four African and five European institutions coordinated by the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium. The SUNRAY-project intends to identify new and innovative ways to address the problem of malnutrition. The research agenda and priorities will be defined primarily by African researchers. Other institutions and individuals with an interest in nutrition and related fields in Africa will also be consulted. African partners will take ownership of the research agenda to ensure that it is sustainable. The research will be integrated with initiatives in other sectors such as agriculture, health, education, social protection and rural development, to address the root causes of malnutrition. The project will link research with policy and action, and involve a broad range of stakeholders, including politicians, government staff, health professionals, nutritionists, consumer and public health organisations, agro- and food industry, policy makers, non-governmental organisations, civil society, UN organisations and donors.(Source: Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp via <a href="http://www.alphagalileo.org/ViewItem.aspx?ItemId=94679&amp;CultureCode=en" target="_blank">AlphaGalileo.org</a>, 28 January 2011)</p>

	On December 1, 2010 IFPRI will release a report of its latest research on food security and climate change. Meant to be a follow-up to its 2009 food policy report ‘Food Security, Farming, and Climate Change to 2050: Scenarios, Results, Policy Options’, this latest report expands further on IFPRI’s climate modelling expertise to address the climate change threat in the context of larger food security challenges. The research monograph considers three combinations of income and population growth: a baseline scenario (with moderate income and population growth), a pessimistic scenario (with low income growth and high population growth), and an optimistic scenario (with high income growth and low population growth). The study combines each of these three income/population scenarios with four plausible climate scenarios that range from slightly to substantially wetter and hotter on average, as well as with an implausible scenario of perfect mitigation (a continuation of today’s climate into the future). Based on 15 possible scenarios to 2050, the results constitute the most comprehensive analysis to date on the scope of climate change as it relates to food security, including who will be most affected and what policymakers can do to facilitate adaptation. The report will be released in Mexico and Washington, DC, early December 2010. (Source: IFPRI, 16 November 2010).</p>

	Produced by African Smallholder Farmers Group with the assistance of Practical Action and other NGOs, 'Africa’s Smallholder Farmers: Approaches that work for viable livelihoods' emphasises the need to support and prioritise smallholder farmers in Africa, and to provide the right kind of support that enables them to strengthen agriculture and livelihoods over the long term (instead of focus on short-term productivity gains). It contains nine case studies of successful approaches, including three from Practical Action's African offices. The African Smallholder Farmers Group is a consortium of agencies whose aim is to promote effective support to smallholder farmers in Africa by sharing lessons and information, collecting evidence of what works and highlighting the important of smallholder farmers to developing country and donor governments. <a href="http://practicalaction.org/reducing-vulnerability/docs/ia1/asfg-africa-smallholder-farmers.pdf%20" target="_blank">View PDF</a> (Source: Zunia, 23 August 2010)</p>

	The Humanitarian Policy Group of the Overseas Development Institute, London, UK, argues in their study of September 2010 ‘Working across borders’ that there remains limited understanding of the nature, magnitude and value of cross-border livelihood activities in the Horn of Africa. The key messages are 


Mobile pastoralist systems often cross international borders. There is a need for more research, policy and practice efforts to better understand and exploit the potential of cross-border activities to enhance drought management, contribute to national economies, and improve local livelihoods and food security in the Horn of Africa.

Governments in the region should cooperate in granting legal and economic legitimacy to informal cross-border trade exchanges and step up collective efforts to control trans-boundary animal diseases.

Regional bodies can play a pivotal coordination role and provide the enabling policy environment and legal framework to regulate cross-border dynamics. Donors should support these processes.


There is also a need to recognize that a timely, adequate and comprehensive response to drought must also focus on border areas and support cross-border activities. (Source: Reliefweb, September 2010)</p>

	Until recently, the coffee berry borer, a beetle that devastates coffee plants, was confined to just a few regions in Central Africa. But since the 1980s, the beetle has gradually spread to every coffee-growing region except Hawaii, Nepal, and Papua New Guinea. Juliana Jaramillo, a biologist at ICIPE, Nairobi, Kenya, suspects temperature increases are to blame. She and her collaborators recently identified the temperature range in which the beetle can survive. They found that the average minimum temperature the borer requires to reproduce is about 68 degrees F. In their research, Jaramillo and her collaborators found that for every 1.8 degrees F increase in temperature, the coffee berry borer became 8.5 per cent more infectious on average. A follow up study, published this year in the Journal of Economic Entomology, found that higher temperatures also caused the female beetles to travel from berry to berry earlier. Coffee farmers need new strategies to combat threats such as the coffee berry borer. (Source: The Guardian, 27 August 2010)</p>

	Scientists at the Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics scientists have inserted a gene which modified rice to increase the number of salt-transporting proteins in specific cells in the rice root. This resulted in salt being trapped in the root where it is less harmful and avoiding its effect to the vulnerable upper part of the plant. Dr. Darren Plett, lead researcher of the study, says that the new GM technique is an ‘efficient and robust biotechnological approach’ to help rice grow in soils with high salinity. ‘Our results provide a new approach for genetic modification to increase the tolerance of crops to the toxic sodium ion (Na+), which is a major environmental stress. Work is now underway to transfer the technology to wheat and barley.

	Farmers and crop scientists worldwide are engaged in an ambitious new effort to add 3,000 yam samples to international genebanks with the aim of saving the diversity of yam, according to the Global Crop Diversity Trust. Benin already has sent 847 yam samples to the IITA, Ibadan, Nigeria. At IITA, the tubers will be grown out in fields, and cuttings taken for conservation in the lab as part of an international collection that already contains about 3,200 yam samples from West Africa. The yam project is part of a broader effort involving major crop species worldwide in which the Trust is helping partners in 68 countries—including 38 in Africa alone—rescue and regenerate more than 80,000 endangered accessions in crop collections and send duplicates to international genebanks and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in the Arctic Circle. For yams, reproduced through vegetative propagation, IITA offers the only long-term form of conservation. Conserving the crop requires extracting tissue in the laboratory and freezing it in liquid nitrogen. However, the technique demands careful research and a staff of dedicated skilled technicians.

	The PNG National Agricultural Research Institute (NARI) has developed a new feeding technology for broiler chicken using locally available feed resources, known as the NARI Broiler Concentrate. This technology is currently going through on-farm trials with many already proving successful in terms of increased profitability from reduced input costs. Comparative broiler production from a recent trial at the Komperi Valley near Kainantu, Eastern Highlands Province, was one of the testimonies of the use of this technology. To combat high feed prices faced by broiler farmers, NARI has taken an approach in using a concentrate diet with local energy sources such as sweet potato and cassava as feed or rations for finishing off broiler chickens to reduce input costs. These NARI concentrates come in two forms; the high energy concentrate which is used with boiled mash cassava and low energy concentrate which is used with boiled mash sweet potatoes. Farmers were also introduced to the sweet potato ensiling technology for the development and storage of pig feeds. (Source: PNG National Agricultural Research Institute, 9 August 2010)</p>

	The Special Meeting of the Council for Trade and Economic Development (COTED) Agriculture held in St George’s, Grenada concluded on 22 october 2010 with the endorsement of the ‘Regional Food and Nutrition Security Policy and Action Plan’, a document meant to be a comprehensive and integrated plan to achieve the objectives of adequate, stable and nutritious supplies of food throughout the Caribbean Region. If implemented, the policy would secure higher food production; better health and nutrition; income and employment opportunities; and poverty alleviation. The COTED and the Council for Human and Social Development (COHSOD) have both approved the blueprint of the Regional Policy during the month of October 2010. The COHSOD acknowledged the critical link between education and food and nutrition security and agreed that a focal team from within the education sector would be nominated to support the implementation of the Regional Policy on Food and Nutrition Security.

					<p>Aflasafe® is a win-win formula for African farmers and investors that uses otherwise harmless fungi to control those that produce deadly aflatoxins in maize and peanut. The biological control of aflatoxins using aflasafe has rekindled hopes of a brighter future for African farmers battling crop contamination even as it opened doors for the private sector looking to invest in a winning formula in the continent's agriculture sector. The aflasafe technology, which uses “good” fungus to fight the “bad” ones, has provided relief to hundreds of maize farmers in northern Nigeria, a region where more than 70% of the population depend on agriculture for at least part of their livelihood. According to Ranajit Bandyopadhyay, IITA (Ibadan, Nigeria) plant pathologist, and Irmgard Hoeschle-Zeledon, coordinator of the CGIAR's Systemwide Program on Integrated Pest Management, an initial investment of US$1-3 million in an aflasafe manufacturing plant is likely to reap investors about N20 million ($1.33 million) annually. Bandyopadhyay indicated that an investment in an aflasafe manufacturing plant in Nigeria would pay off considering the huge demand for quality maize in the country and its neighbours.

	Several countries in Africa such as Togo, Sierra Leone and Rwanda are now receiving funds for agricultural development from the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP). A $22 billion pledge made by the G8 and commitment from African governments will enable African countries to achieve food security and higher economic growth. CAADP will guide governments on sustainable land and water management; building trade and marketing infrastructure; increasing food and nutrition security; and promoting research in agriculture, extension and training for adoption and dissemination of new technologies. FANRPAN, a network of researchers, farmers and governments covering 14 Southern African countries, is coordinating the program at the national and regional levels in the sub-region.

	A recent study led by Michel Pimpert of the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED, London, UK), has, for the first time, properly consulted small African farmers on how to solve the problem of feeding sub-Saharan Africa. The farmers’ answers appear to directly repudiate a massive international effort to launch an African Green Revolution funded in large part by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Instead of new hybrid seeds, chemical fertilisers and pesticides, family farmers in West Africa said they want to use local seeds, avoid spending precious cash on chemicals and most importantly to direct public agricultural research to meet their needs, according to a multi-media publication released on World Food Day (Oct. 16). The report reveals that there is a clear vision from these small farmers, and that they reject the approach of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA). (Source: IPS, 16 October 2010)</p>

	A collaborative team of scientists, led by researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin (USA) has made a <a href="http://www.nature.com/nsmb/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nsmb.1887.html" target="_blank">significant advance</a> on the discovery last year of pyrabactin (by Sean Cutler of the University of California, Riverside). Pyrabactin is a synthetic chemical that mimics a naturally produced stress hormone in plants to help them cope with drought conditions. Plants naturally produced a stress hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), in modest amounts to help them survive drought by inhibiting growth. ABA has already been commercialized for agricultural use. But it has at least two disadvantages: it is light-sensitive and costly to make. Pyrabactin, on the other hand, is relatively inexpensive, easy to make, and not sensitive to light. But its drawback is that, unlike ABA, it does not turn on all the ‘receptors’ in the plant that need to be activated for drought-tolerance to fully take hold. By understanding how pyrabactin works and with more research like the current one, the drawbacks of pyrabactin can be studied, and other more effective chemicals can be developed more readily for bringing drought-resistance to plants.

	Solomon Gelalcha, Director of Kulumsa Agricultural Research Center (KARC, Kulumsa, Ethiopia) one of the organizations under the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research said two new wheat varieties were developed by researchers at Kulumsa through a new approach called ‘Durable Rust Resistance in Wheat’ (DRRW). These new varieties are resistant to multiple current and possible future wheat killer pathogens of yellow, stem and leave wheat rusts. The DRRW approach focuses on giving the new wheat varieties durability against any wheat disease. The previous model gave varieties ‘vertical resistance’ to a single disease, and is easily defeated by new diseases or when the disease they are resistant to evolves. Kulumsa is attempting to release the new varieties of wheat before having them officially approved. (Source: ISP, 17 September 2010)</p>

	Scientists in Nigeria and six other African nations are experimenting with a fast-yielding, disease-resistant species of cassava. The results so far are glowing: the new plants stand taller, and appear stronger and more vibrant. When their tubers are pulled from the ground, they resemble fat, oversized fingers. The cassava stems are not genetically-modified. They were obtained through a conventional process of breeding and selection over more than a decade. Researchers at IITA, Ibadan, Nigeria, are distributing the stems to local farmers free of charge. They hope to get the improved cassava into 75,000 farms by the end of the year to increase yields in seven selected Nigerian states. The first results have been promising, scientists and farmers say. The project is financed by USAID and targets about 400,000 farmers in seven African nations: Sierra Leone, Ghana, Tanzania, Malawi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique and Nigeria.

	Production of Kenya's smallholder Arabica coffee is set to receive a boost with the launch of a new coffee variety that is resistant to the coffee berry disease (CBD) and coffee rust. Known as 'Batian', the new variety has been developed by the Coffee Research Foundation (CRF) and is reported to reduce production costs by 30 per cent. The new variety yields up to five tonnes per hectare by the fourth year, when production is at its peak. (Source: New Agriculturist, September 2010)</p>

	KA2-101, a specially bred cacao cultivar developed by the Cacao and Coconut Research Institute in Papua New Guinea is one of the parents breed used to map the cacao genome. On 15 September 2010, a first draft of the cacao genome has been completed by a consortium of academic, governmental, and industry scientists. Indiana University Bloomington scientists performed much of the sequencing work, which is described and detailed at <a href="http://www.cacaogenomedb.org/" target="_blank">the official website of the Cacao Genome Database</a> project.

					<p>At the 5th African Agriculture Science Week, hosted by the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA) experts from the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) told researchers that urgent action is needed to stop the rapid and alarming loss of genetic diversity of African livestock, the livelihood of 70 percent of rural Africans and a treasure-trove of drought- and disease-resistant animals. On the basis of a new analysis, the scientists were urged to expand their efforts to identify and preserve the unique traits, particularly in West Africa, of the continent's rich array of cattle, sheep, goats and pigs developed over several millennia but now under siege. ILRI's push to preserve Africa's indigenous livestock is part of a broader effort to improve productivity on African farms through what is known as 'landscape genomics'. Landscape genomics involves, among other things, sequencing the genomes of different livestock varieties from many regions and looking for the genetic signatures associated with their suitability to a particular environment.
