						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Scientists at an India-based institute are developing new varieties of pigeon pea, a high-protein dietary staple. In the eastern Kenyan district of Makueni, a research team is testing more than 40 varieties of pigeon pea, cross-bred to thrive in different altitudes, temperatures, rainfall, and other conditions, that can also be grown in Tanzania, Malawi, and Mozambique. The new varieties of pigeon peas are being introduced to Kenya by the <a href="http://www.icrisat.org/" target="_self">International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, ICRISAT</a>. Farmers have cultivated pigeon pea in this East African nation for centuries. But traditional varieties tend to take about 10 months to mature. Some of the new varieties being developed and tested in Kenya mature within five months of being planted, enabling farmers to have two or more harvests a year. Maize, considered to be the key crop in Kenya, does not flourish in times of drought. But pigeon pea grows well in dry times, says scientist Said Silim, director of ICRISAT's Eastern and Southern Africa program. (Source: VAO, 29 June 2009)</p>

					<p>The first ever meeting between agriculture ministers from the world's eight most industrialised nations (G8) called for more public and private investment in sustainable farming to boost food supplies and ensure global food security. The meeting took place in Italy on 18-20 April 2009. G8 agriculture ministers called for more food to be grown to feed the world's hungry, given the lack of progress in tackling poverty and problems in balancing food supply with demand. The ministers said public and private investment in sustainable farming and rural development need to be increased, and called for increased support including investments in agricultural science, research, technology, education, extension services and innovation. The ministers denounced the 'food protectionism' exercised by rich and poor countries alike in the form of export bans and import duties in farming, and stressed the importance of a rules-based international system for farm trade. About price volatility the G8 farm ministers’ statement said that &quot;there should be monitoring and further analysis of factors potentially affecting price volatility in commodity markets, including speculation&quot;. The ministers also outlined the merits of buffer grain stocks as an emergency food facility to ease price shocks and curb speculative commodity trading, and said they would ask international organisations to examine the &quot;feasibility and administrative modalities&quot; of a common stockholding system. The statement does not refer to the sensitive issue of 'land-grabbing', i.e. the growing trend for governments to invest in farm projects beyond their borders.

					<p>The Rothamsted International African Fellows Programme is now inviting pre-proposals under its 9th call. The aim of the <a href="http://www.rothamsted-international.org/afp/index.shtml" target="_blank">African Fellows Programme (AFP)</a> is to support sustainable agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa by catalysing innovative solutions needed to achieve food security. Projects should focus on specific problems in agriculture with a researchable constraint. They should also aim to develop lasting partnerships and strategic alliances that will help in developing local scientific capacity relevant to sustainable agricultural production. The potential impact of the project on small-holder farmers will be a major consideration during proposal assessment. African scientists will carry out research projects at a partner European research institute or university, for a maximum period of 6 months. Fellowships are awarded on a competitive basis in a two stage assessment process. Deadline: 19 June 2009.</p>

					<p>The first issue of the journal Food Security is online, with a foreword from Norman Borlaug, initiator of the Green Revolution and Nobel Peace Price winner in 1970. The journal Food Security offers a mixture of original refereed papers taking a synthetic view of the science, sociology and economics of food production, agricultural development, access to food, and nutrition, together with review articles, case studies and letters to the editor. The journal covers the principles and practice of food security per se, taking an overview of the subject or analyzing it with a broad perspective over its many component disciplines.To address the challenge of global food security, the journal probes the constraints - physical, biological and socio-economic - which not only limit food production but also the ability of people to access a healthy diet. From this perspective, the journal covers Global food needs; Global food potential; Nutrition, food quality and safety; impinging socio-political factors, and more. Food Security is published quarterly (March, June, September, December).</p>

					<p>As part of its response to high food prices, FAO has developed an interactive database of staple food prices on national markets in 55 developing countries from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. The “National Basic Food Prices Data and Analysis Tool” shows the prices of different food commodities in local currencies or dollars and local measurements as well as standard weights. “While food prices have fallen internationally, as indicated by the FAO food price index, this tool shows that in developing countries they have not fallen so fast, or at all,” said Liliana Balbi, a senior economist with FAO’s Global Information and Early Warning System. “The easy-to-use database will be an invaluable source of information for policy and decision-makers in agricultural production and trade, development and also humanitarian work.” (Source: FAO, 19 March 2009)</p>

	At the recent launch in Nairobi of a new digital map showing soil depletion in Africa, soil scientists decried poor rates of fertiliser application in the continent. Five hundred million hectares of Africa's agricultural land is moderately or severely mined of life, it was reported, yet farmers apply only ten percent of the required soil nutrients to support food production. Soil scientists in Africa and beyond are now convinced that investments focusing on depleted soils are vital to achieve a turn-around in agricultural productivity.

					<p><b>Are fuels a close substitute of food in South Africa?</b> By D. Weatherspoon; A. Mabiso, AgEcon Search, July 2008. There are growing concerns that food-fuel tradeoffs are beginning to present serious challenges for food security. Understanding the nature of food-fuels tradeoffs is imperative for effective policy making and safeguarding consumers’ welfare. This preliminary study aims to explain that nature in South Africa, which is conducting a biofuel expansion strategy. The increased use of crops in South Africa to produce biofuel implies that more of scarce resources are being re-allocated away from the provisioning of food. Related to this, the paper asks to what extent biofuel is gross substitute or complement of oil in the South African fuel mix. </p>
