						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>An international team of researchers used genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to determine the individual genetic make-up of 971 sorghum varieties taken from world-wide seed collections. One subject of particular scrutiny was the genetic control of the panicle, the structure on the top of the plant that holds the grains. Closely packed grains, for example, are preferred for maximum crop yield in dry areas, but in places with abundant rainfall, more spacing is desirable to allow grains dry out more readily and reduce crop losses from moisture-caused disease. The researchers identified genes that likely contribute to this physical feature, and they also mapped them geographically according to the source of the original seed. The result was insight into how different variants of the genes spread according to regional climates.&nbsp;<a href="http://phys.org/news/2013-01-sorghum-gene-bank-agriculture-climate.html" target="_blank">http://phys.org/news/2013-01-sorghum-gene-bank-agriculture-climate.html</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(phys.org, 01/2013)</p>

					<p><i>AlphaGalileo</i> reported that researchers at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden found that rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide have a negative impact on the protein content of wheat grain and thus its nutritional quality. The results are unequivocal: ‘Elevated carbon dioxide levels often increase the size of the grain yield, but also lead to a reduction in quality in the form of lower protein content’, says Håkan Pleijel, Professor of Environmental Science at the university’s Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences.(via <a href="http://goo.gl/3kAXF" target="_blank">AlphaGalileo</a>, 10/12/2012)</p>

					<p>A study by ecologists Peter Reich and Sarah Hobbie at the University of Minnesota in St-Paul, &nbsp;suggests that estimates of how much carbon dioxide land plants can use are far too optimistic. Plants also need soil nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, to grow. But few studies have tested whether soils contain enough of these nutrients to fuel growth in proportion to rising carbon dioxide. Researchers say that much more work is needed to understand how nutrient dynamics will affect carbon uptake.(Nature News, 1/10/2012)</p>

					<p>Smallholder farmers across East Africa have started to embrace climate-resilient farming approaches and technologies, according to new research published by the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS). At the same time, the survey evidence suggests that many of the changes in farming practices are incremental, rather than transformative in nature, and that high levels of food insecurity prevent many from making all of the changes needed in order to cope with a changing climate.(<a href="http://ccafs.cgiar.org/news/press-releases/landmark-survey-finds-adaptation-climate-change-smallholder-farms-taking-root" target="_blank">CCAFS</a>, 7/9/2012)</p>

					<p>In order to understand the regional research needs and priorities and to develop strategic partnership for the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) research at national and regional scales, CCAFS East Africa Program has been actively engaging partners at national and regional levels (through consultation workshops and focus group discussion). A major outcome of the consultative meetings is a synthesis of the regional research needs and priorities, including opportunities for pilot participatory research activities at CCAFS sites in East Africa (<a href="http://scienceworkshop-june2012.wikispaces.com/" target="_self">Research needs and priorities in East Africa</a>). In order to respond to the need to develop projects that address the challenges and gaps synthesized from the research needs, CCAFS East Africa convened a regional science workshop. At the end of the workshop, four thematic research groups were formed. Research areas include:


Mapping risks and opportunities for targeting appropriate crop and livestock adaptation strategies in East Africa

Use of climate scenarios, spatial and temporal analogues in designing adaptation strategies in agriculture

Quantification of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to inform mitigation interventions in East African cropping systems

Assessment of land management strategies for crop-livestock intensification for climate change mitigation

Reducing risk and capitalizing on opportunities created by variable climate through use of improved downscaled seasonal climate forecast 

Agriculture-climate knowledge interface for policy and action

					<p>This resource is being developed by the project ‘Adapting agriculture to climate change: collecting, protecting and preparing crop wild relatives’. This Project is led by the Global Crop Diversity Trust and the Millennium Seed Bank of the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, UK, and is supported by the Government of Norway. It is being implemented through partnerships with national and international crop conservation and use programmes, universities and other research institutions, and in accordance with the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. Many individual scientists, herbaria, genebanks and specialist institutes are contributing advice and information to the Project and this website. The Project aims to collect the wild relatives of 26 key crops, conserve them in genebanks, and prepare them for use in plant breeding programmes in time to breed new crop varieties adapted to new climates.<a href="http://www.cwrdiversity.org/" target="_self">http://www.cwrdiversity.org/</a></p>

					<p>In order to understand the regional research needs and priorities and to develop strategic partnership for the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) research at national and regional scales, CCAFS East Africa Program has been actively engaging partners at national and regional levels. As part of the engagement process, three national consultative workshops on priorities for agricultural adaptation and mitigation research were held in Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda in 2011. At the regional level, two workshops were held: a farmer consultation workshop in partnership with Eastern Africa Farmers Federation (EAFF) that discussed the linkages between climate change and agriculture, farmer participation in research priority setting, scaling up knowledge generation and dissemination, and enhancing resiliency and adaptive capacity; and a workshop on improving regional climate information and food system coordination in order to consult key stakeholders from the region on regional agricultural and food security contingency planning processes, current and potential use of climate-related information, and means of improving planning and coordination in East Africa. A major outcome of the consultative meetings is a synthesis of the regional research needs and priorities, including opportunities for pilot participatory research activities at CCAFS sites in East Africa.(CCAFS, 1/8/2012)<a href="http://ccafs.cgiar.org/blog/responding-research-needs-climate-change-and-agriculture-east-africa" target="_blank">http://ccafs.cgiar.org/blog/responding-research-needs-climate-change-and-agriculture-east-africa</a></p>

					<p>A Kansas State University-led study looked at the drought tolerance of 426 species of grass from around the world. The goal was to better understand how grasslands in different parts of the world may respond to the changes in frequency and severity of drought in the future. Grasslands have several important ecological functions: they convert and store carbon dioxide, are a food source for grazing animals like cattle and bison, and help cool the surrounding atmosphere. The goal of the study was to drought-stress the species of grass to identify the ones that could survive without water for over a week’s time. Researchers developed a drought index for the tested species based on the data. The index details each species' tolerance to drought and can help ecologists understand why grasslands around the world are composed of their species.<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-08/ksu-dkg080812.php" target="_blank">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-08/ksu-dkg080812.php</a>(EurekAlert, 8/8/2012)</p>

					<p>The poorest societies may be more able to adapt to the threat climate change poses to food supplies than their slightly richer peers, a new study suggests. We might assume getting richer would always make a country safer from drought and famine, but that turns out not to be the case. Instead, the very poorest countries seem to become more vulnerable in the early stages of a transition to modern agriculture. There's a crucial period before the benefits of modernisation start to kick in, during which they are more vulnerable to problems like drought than when they started. For example, switching from pastoral farming to settled agriculture can bring benefits to local people in the long-term, once they can introduce new techniques like higher-yielding, drought-resistant crops and modern machinery. But these need investment to work, and it takes time for poor farmers to build up the necessary capital. In the meantime, most land has been parcelled up into private plots and is now crisscrossed by fences, so people can no longer respond to drought as their pastoralist ancestors would have - by simply moving their herds somewhere with more water.

					<p>The Programme of Research on Climate Change Vulnerability, Impacts and Adaptation (<a href="http://www.provia-climatechange.org" target="_blank">PROVIA</a>) is a global initiative by UNEP, UNESCO and WMO which aims to provide direction and coherence at the international level for research on vulnerability, impacts and adaptation (VIA). Launched with the support of leading scientists and decision-makers, PROVIA responds to the urgent call by the scientific community for a more cohesive and coordinated approach, and the critical need to harmonize, mobilize, and communicate the growing knowledge-base on VIA. To this end, PROVIA will act as a new and growing network of scientists, practitioners and decision-makers working towards identifying research gaps and meeting policy needs in climate change vulnerability, impact and adaptation research. Acknowledging emerging policy strategies, new scientific developments and lessons learnt from past programmes, PROVIA promises to deliver, in collaboration with its implementing partners, improved coordination of international research on the impacts of and responses to climate change, and provide the credible scientific information that is being increasingly requested by the world’s decision makers. </p>

					<p>The CGIAR Programme on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security has been improving on the MarkSimGCM stochastic weather generator tool. MarkSim GCM lets the user generate plausible weather data for future climates, using models and scenarios from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report. The new tool, Marksim_Standalone, is a development of the MarkSimGCM web application. It is designed for computer users who need to process a lot of data without the need for a user interface. The tool can generate multiple realisations of years of daily data: rainfall, maximum and minimum temperatures and solar radiation. It produces weather files that are fully compatible with the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop modelling system.

					<p>The announcement at the close of 2011 of the successful transformation of nine transgenic maize lines by scientists funded and coordinated by ASARECA has generated excitement across the continent. Plants transformed with drought tolerance genes show more tolerance to water deficiency, and some of the genes once incorporated into the maize genome are capable of helping maize to return to full recovery after completely drying up. The plants can wither but can get back to life on rehydration by rain or irrigation after 24-72 hours. The nine lines; two Ethiopian lines, three Kenyan lines, two Sudanese lines, and two Tanzanian lines, are due to undergo further scientific testing before they start the journey into the uptake pathways to the ultimate destination – the farmers plate.

					<p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) Renewable Energy Technology Deployment (IEA-RETD) has published a study on renewable energies for remote areas and islands (REMOTE). Its objective is to provide policy perspectives for making remote areas and islands largely independent from fossil fuel imports and costly energy transmission infrastructures. It provides decision-makers with a better grasp of the technical, economic and energy issues facing remote areas, as well as to present a menu of policy options available to accelerate renewable energy development in these regions. The report aims to equip national, regional and local policymakers with perspective, context, and inspiration on how to develop sustainable energy strategies.(<a href="http://sids-l.iisd.org/news/study-highlights-renewable-energy-potential-and-policy-options-for-island-and-remote-areas/%20" target="_blank">IICD SIDS</a>, 27/04/2012)</p>

					<p>The Joint Programming Initiative <a href="http://www.faccejpi.com/" target="_blank">FACCE–JPI</a> has announced the approval for funding of its first joint action which brings together 67 research groups from 17 European countries. The initiative’s research agenda will address the modelling of impacts of climate change on European agriculture and food security and the reduction of uncertainties in climate change scenarios. An innovative, tailor-made instrument, a ‘Knowledge Hub’, was developed by the FACCE–JPI, associating three complementary dimensions: networking, research and capacity building.

					<p>
Fifty to sixty percent of shrimp farms are located in tidal zones in Asian countries, mostly on cleared mangrove forests. The carbon footprint of the shrimp from this land use is about 10-fold greater than the land use carbon footprint of an equivalent amount of beef produced from a pasture formed from a tropical rainforest.

					<p>A research team from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, US, has shown that plants subjected to a previous period of drought are able to better withstand new periods of water stress. The research confirms for the first time the scientific basis for what home gardeners and nursery professionals have often learned through hard experience: Transplants do better when water is withheld for a few days to drought harden them before the move. This phenomenon of drought hardening was documented when scientists compared the reaction of plants that had been previously stressed by withholding water to those not previously stressed. The pre-stressed plants bounced back more quickly the next time they were dehydrated. Specifically, the non-strained plants wilted faster than trained plants and their leaves lost water at a faster rate than trained plants. Plant nurseries adopting this drought hardening process could ensure smallholder farmers in drought-prone regions.

					<p>At the General Assembly of the Association for Strengthening Agricultural Research in Eastern and Central Africa (ASARECA), Executive Director Dr Seyfu Ketema announced the successful production of transgenic maize seeds with a construct of a gene scientifically coded as PNOV-ASARAnxzm35. The gene, also known as the ASARECA gene, was isolated from the maize egg cell. Plants with this genes show more resistance to water deficit. They are capable of returning to full recovery after drying up. Nine maize lines have been successfully transformed by incorporating them with genes that give plants the capacity to resist drought. The research was conducted by scientist in eastern and central Africa and led by Professor Jesse Machuka of Kenyatta University, Kenya. The nine maize lines are being multiplied in a screen house at Kenyatta University in preparation for confined field trials.(<a href="http://www.asareca.org/?q=content/breakthrough-gmo-maize-research-excites-asareca-general-assembly " target="_blank">ASARECA</a>, 18/01/2012)</p>
