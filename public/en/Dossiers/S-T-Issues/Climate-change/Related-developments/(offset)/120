						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>African and European researchers are to join forces in a new project that is to use climate modelling to predict outbreaks of diseases in Senegal, Ghana and Malawi. In the new project, researchers across 13 European and African research institutes are set to work together to integrate data from climate modelling and disease forecasting systems to predict the likelihood of an epidemic up to six months in advance. The research, funded by the EC is set to focus on climate and disease in Senegal, Ghana and Malawi and aims to give decision makers the necessary time to deploy intervention methods to help prevent large scale spread of diseases such as Rift Valley Fever and malaria.

In Kenya, agricultural extension officers offer seasonal and locally relevant climate predictions explained in simple terms in Kikamba, the regional tribal language. They are now producing a handbook to translate weather predictions into practical advice about what and when to plant. The project also helped farmers set up a seed bank. A group of about 40 men will collect, process and preserve the best local seeds and loan them out again during the next planting season, slowly selecting for the best climate-adapted varieties. Now, farmers can circumvent the expensive seed market, where they can't even tell if they are getting the seed varieties they are paying for.(Source: Scientific American, 29 March 2010)</p>

	In another 40 years, would maize still be the staple food in Kenya, If not, what could people grow and eat? And, if you could grow maize, how much water and fertilizer would it need? For the first time, a customized regional climate model linked to crop growing and water models, run on a supercomputer at Michigan State University, will help provide crop breeders Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania with detailed answers on crop yields. Many research institutions have been working on models to predict the impact of climate change on food production in Africa, and in a few months the MSU model will help scientists and breeders to zoom in at a regional level on the possible impact of climate change on a wide variety of crops in these countries.

					<p>Adapting our food plants to climate change is a challenge that is exercising the minds of the world’s plant breeders, including Dr Calvin Qualset of the University of California, Davis, who spoke at the Food Security and Climate Change conference in Amman on 3 February. Breeding for uncertain environmental conditions is often like aiming for a moving target, said Dr Qualset. He spoke about the range of tools that plant breeders can use to develop crop varieties that are resilient in the face of variable climatic conditions, increasing water shortage and increasing consumer demand. He also highlighted the way in which plant breeders have changed their approach over the last few decades, moving from the solutions of the Green Revolution – where a small number of relatively homogenous varieties could be grown across large areas – to a focus on landraces and their development.

					<p>Africa's livestock producers are proving resilient to climate change and generating huge economic benefits for their nations and regions, researchers said in a book published on the 31th of January by the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) and SOS Sahel. The book shows how pastoralism is a major economic player and contributor to many African economies and one whose importance is only set to grow as climate change takes hold. The book shows how livestock play a key role in the economic prosperity in African's drylands by supporting hundreds of millions of people, and a massive meat and leather industry. 'What is remarkable is that these benefits all arise from animals fed solely on natural pasture,' said Ced Hesse, a researcher at IIED and one of the book's authors.

					<p>Fifty-five countries have submitted pledges for curbing greenhouse gas emissions to the UN climate convention. Governments were asked to do so before 31 January by the &quot;Copenhagen Accord&quot;, the document produced at December's UN climate summit in the Danish capital. In some cases the pledges are weaker than those made before the summit. The UN's top climate official, Yvo de Boer, said the pledges would invigorate the UN process, but several environment groups say they do not go far enough. Submissions have come from major developed and developing countries, and collectively account for about three-quarters of the world's emissions from energy use. But few of the smaller, more vulnerable nations have sent in their figures. (Source: BBC News, 1 February 2010) </p>

					<p>By IIED, December 2009. This special issue of Participatory Learning and Action focuses on recent approaches to climate change adaptation which are community-based and participatory, building on the priorities, knowledge, and capacities of local people. It discusses how community-based approaches to climate change have emerged, and the similarities and differences between CBA and other participatory development and disaster risk reduction approaches. It highlights innovative participatory methods which are developing to help communities analyse the causes and effects of climate change, integrate scientific and community knowledge of climate change, and plan adaptation measures. Whilst CBA is a relatively new field, some lessons and challenges are beginning to emerge, including how to integrate disaster risk reduction, livelihoods and climate change adaptation work, climate change knowledge gaps, issues around the type and quality of participation, and the need for policies and institutions that support CBA. </p>

					<p>Four rapidly developing countries — Brazil, South Africa, India and China (known as BASIC) — have vowed to boost climate science cooperation among themselves and other developing countries. The countries will develop a framework for permanent scientific cooperation on climate change and extend technological support to other developing nations, especially least developed countries (LDCs), in areas such as forestry and adaptation. The BASIC group is yet to decide how much it will give LDCs, though Carlos Minc, Brazil's environment minister, estimated the total would exceed the US$10 billion pledged by rich countries. The nations are exploring ways to extend technical support in their own scientific strengths. (Source: Africa the good news, 25 January 2010) </p>

					<p>Understanding how carbon dioxide impacts food quality is vital to tackle malnutrition effectively, says agricultural researcher Lewis Ziska. Researchers are focusing much attention on how to adapt agriculture to ensure steady food supplies in the face of climate change. But it is equally important to preserve the quality of these supplies as well as the quantity. Researchers, policymakers and the public are increasingly aware that climate uncertainty — characterised by shifting rainfall patterns, increased desertification and warming temperatures — threatens to decrease people's ability to grow food sustainably in many parts of the developing world. But few know that rising levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) — the principal greenhouse gas — is also expected to affect the nutritional value of many basic food crops.

					<p>Disappointed by the ‘failure’ of the Copenhagen talks to adequately help poor countries adapt to climate change, the Burkina Faso government and farmers are working to adjust farming techniques to changing weather patterns. ‘Despite the failure of Copenhagen we must follow adaptation at our own cost because we have been experiencing the impacts of climate change in Burkina for several years, and they are getting worse,’ Bassiaka Dao, confederation of farmers in Burkina Faso (CPF) president, told IRIN. A key agriculture activity is to extend traditional soil protection techniques, said Dao. Methods include digging “Zai” pits – compost-filled planting pits which hold water, helping deep-rooted vegetables grow; building up grass and rock barriers around crops to protect them from soil erosion; and cultivating manure in septic tanks to use as fertilizer.

					<p>One month after the Copenhagen climate change summit which failed to live up to the expectations of many developing nations including Nigeria, indications are rife that the increasing level of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere pose serious danger to some staples like cassava on which millions of African people depend. Recent studies by Australian scientists have shown that the crops become more toxic and produce smaller yields in environments with higher carbon dioxide levels and more droughts.The findings underscored the need to develop climate-change-resistant cultivars to feed rapidly growing human populations, said Ros Gleadow of the Monash University in Melbourne.
