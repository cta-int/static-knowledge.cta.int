						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Rural farming communities and those whose livelihoods are directly impacted by climate change can benefit greatly from better use of ICTs in alleviating poverty and finding ways to farm sustainably. In this regard, developers and entrepreneurs across the Continent have been working on mobile and computer-based systems which would help tackle climate change in creative ways. This creativity was rewarded by the US Department of State’s Bureau of African Affairs in the <a href="http://www.apps4africa.org/blog/2012/01/14/east-africa-winners-announced-at-villages-in-action-2012/" target="_blank">Apps4Africa Climate Challenge</a>. Announced in January 2012, the first place in the challenge went to ‘The Grainy Bunch’ app, made by 29-year-old Eric Mutta of Tanzania. The Grainy Bunch is a national (Tanzania) grain supply chain management system that monitors the purchase, storage, distribution, and consumption of grain across the entire nation. It was developed with the understanding that selling ‘the effects of efficiency’ to actors in the grain supply chain is much easier than selling ‘the effects of climate change’.<a href="http://www.elearning-africa.com/eLA_Newsportal/youthful-innovation-at-apps4africa/" target="_self">http://www.elearning-africa.com/eLA_Newsportal/youthful-innovation-at-apps4africa/</a></p>

					<p>The European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) published a study mapping the potential of renewable energy sources in Africa. The report analysed the current energy consumption in Africa and assesses potential of renewable energy sources – solar, wind, biomass and hydropower – and their cost efficiency and environmental sustainability. This publication coincided with the official European launch of the UN's year on ‘Sustainable Energy for All’. The map of Africa's solar electricity potential, based-on the JRC's Photovoltaic Geographical Information System (PVGIS), showed that in many parts of Africa the same photovoltaic panel could produce twice the electricity as it would produce in central Europe. However, in order to assess the suitability of solar energy to provide electricity in rural areas, this option has to be assessed against costs for grid extensions and with the traditional diesel generators. A combined analysis of photovoltaic systems, grid extensions and diesel options shows which option is the most cost efficient for each area.

					<p>Farmers in western Kenya experience the dire effects of climate change, through drought and the decline of soil fertility which seriously threaten their livelihoods. A methodology and approach on soil carbon, for sustainable agricultural land management (SALM) practices approved by Verified Carbon Standard and developed by the World Bank for the Smallholder Agriculture Carbon Finance project run by the non-governmental organisation Vi Agroforestry in western Kenya has been recognised internationally. The methodology encourages smallholder farmers in Kenya – and potentially worldwide – to adopt improved farming techniques, boost productivity, increase their resilience to climate change, and earn carbon credits. The pilot, involving more than 60,000 smallholders who are farming 45,000 hectares of land, is run together with smallholder farmers and supported by the World Bank’s BioCarbon Fund.

					<p>While last month’s climate negotiations in Durban made incremental progress towards helping farmers adapt to climate change and reduce agriculture’s climate footprint, a group of international agriculture experts, led by Sir John Beddington, writing in the January 20 issue of <i>Science</i> magazine (‘What Next for Agriculture After Durban?’), urges scientists to lay the groundwork for more decisive action on global food security in environmental negotiations in 2012. The authors see a need for more ‘integrated research’ focused on sustainable agricultural practices that are appropriate for ‘different regions, farming systems, and landscapes’, particularly in low income countries where climate change is expected to pose the greatest challenge. The goal, the authors said, is to achieve a ‘safe operating space’ where farmers can produce enough food to meet global needs while adapting to various climatic stresses and also minimizing the environmental impact of food production.(<a href="http://ccafs.cgiar.org/news/researchers-outline-food-security-climate-change-road-map-science%20" target="_blank">CCAFS</a> via <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6066/289%20" target="_blank">Science</a>, 19/01/2012) </p>

					<p>The <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/014/i2454e/i2454e00.pdf" target="_blank">Issue paper</a> is aimed at discussing how the entire food sector, from the farmer’s field to the consumer’s plate, can become more ‘energy-smart’. Implying the requirement of transformation along the food chain involves: <b>(i)</b> relying more on low-carbon energy systems and using energy more efficiently; <b>(ii)</b> strengthening the role of renewable energy within food systems; <b>(iii)</b> providing greater access to modern energy services for development, and at the same time supporting the achievement of national food security and sustainable development goals. The paper provides examples of energy-smart practices for both small-and large-scale enterprises and covers the entire food sector. The approach used to develop this system is based on three pillars <b>(i)</b> providing energy access for all; <b>(ii)</b> improving energy efficiency at all stages of the food supply chain; and <b>(iii)</b> substituting fossil fuels with renewable energy systems in the food sector. The issue paper presents data analysis results for reducing the dependence on fossil fuel in agriculture and serves as support document for designing energy-smart agricultural policies.

					<p>By expanding underexploited agricultural strategies, smallholder farmers can mitigate climate change, increase their resilience to climate change impacts and boost their profits from agricultural production, new research has revealed. Using crop and livestock model simulations and household survey data across Kenya's diverse climate zones, researchers from IFPRI, ILRI, the Kenya Agriculture Research Institute (KARI) and the University of Georgia (US) identified a number of these 'triple-win' strategies. The combined application of inorganic fertiliser, mulch, and manure – which simultaneously enhances crop yields, increases soil carbon stocks, and boosts profits – was identified as one of the most effective triple-win strategies. The use of higher quality feeds for livestock, which boosts profits and decreases methane emissions, is another important strategy. The researchers state that Kenya and other countries in sub-Sahara Africa must integrate triple-win agricultural strategies into their national climate change action plans.

					<p>Determining how climate change will affect global ecology and ecosystem services is one of the next important frontiers in environmental science. A meta-study by two researchers of the National University of Singapore <a href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v1/n8/full/nclimate1259.html" target="_blank">published</a> in <i>Nature Climate Change</i>, shows many species exhibit smaller sizes as a result of climate change and suggests many others are likely to shrink in response to continued climate change, following fundamental ecological and metabolic rules. This could negatively impact both crop plants and protein sources such as fish that are important f or human nutrition. Furthermore, heterogeneity in response is likely to upset ecosystem balances. The authors discuss future research directions to better understand the trend and help ameliorate the trophic cascades and loss of biodiversity that will probably result from continued decreases in organism size.

	For fruits, cereals and leguminous plants such as oranges, wheat, beans and olives to grow in hot and dry climates, they must be irrigated regularly. And very often the water used comes from deep wells. In Egypt, many farmers currently use diesel generators to water their fields. A model project in Upper Egypt shows that other methods are possible. Here, a photovoltaic stand-alone system takes care of irrigating a wheat field. Concentrator photovoltaic system (CPV) modules – which, due to their higher degree of effectiveness and their particular construction, require far less space than traditional PV modules – supply the energy, while Fresnel lenses concentrate the rays of the sun onto pinhead-sized multi-junction solar cells. With the aid of a tracking motor, the CPV cells, which are attached to a pillar, follow the sun precisely to achieve an optimized yield of solar light. They supply the energy for a submersible pump that pumps the water up from a well that is 105 feet deep and for a small desalination unit that satisfies farmers’ potable water requirements. The CPV cells also supply the energy for PV-module trackers, the monitoring and control system and an air-conditioning unit that cools the utility room of the facility.(<a href="http://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2010-2011/20/solar-power-management.jsp" target="_blank">Frauenhofer-Gesellschaft</a> via <a href="http://www.alphagalileo.org/ViewItem.aspx?ItemId=109523&amp;CultureCode=en" target="_blank">AlphaGalileo</a>, 2/8/2011)</p>

	Breeding crops with deeper roots could significantly reduce atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide and make crops more drought resistant, according to a research <a href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/news/display/?id=7296" target="_blank">study</a> conducted at the University of Manchester. Reporting in the journal, Annals of Botany, professor Douglas Kell calculated that breeding crops whose roots extend 2 meters underground, rather than the 1-meter roots common to many crops, could double the amount of carbon captured from the atmosphere. In principle, any crop could be treated in this way, giving more productive yields while also being better for the environment. Kell reported that creating crops and plants with deeper and bushier roots would also lead to more water and nutrient retention and produce more sustainable plant yields as the world warms and droughts increase in water-stressed regions.

	In the <a href="https://www.agronomy.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/40/3/907" target="_blank">May-June 2011 issue</a> of the Journal of Environmental Quality, a team led by Mark Powell, a soil scientist with the USDA Agricultural Research Service's U.S. Dairy Forage Research Center in Madison, Wisconsin, describes how natural plant compounds known as tannins can reduce both the amount of nitrogen cows excrete in urine, and the action of a microbial enzyme in manure that converts the nitrogen into ammonia on the barn floor.Feeding tannins to cattle could not only help dairy farmers reduce these impacts and meet regulatory standards, but tannins could also boost nitrogen use efficiency in cows, thereby decreasing the need for expensive protein supplements. Tannins are perhaps best known for their role in leather tanning, but Powell began investigating them in ruminant feed more than two decades ago in West Africa. In the communities where he worked, tannin-rich shrubs were grown as windbreaks, and to amend the soil and feed livestock. Tannins in the diets of cattle, sheep and goats are in fact well-studied in the tropics, where the vegetation tends to be naturally higher in the astringent plant chemicals, Powell explains. The tannin sources investigated in the study are already approved for animal feed, and ‘the levels we used amount to pennies per cow per day’.

	New modelling work by an Agricultural Research Service (ARS, the research arm of the U.S Department of Agriculture, USDA) team, suggests that a dairy cow living year-round outdoors may leave a markedly smaller negative ecological impact than sheltered dairy cows. The team used the ‘Integrated Farm System Model’ (<a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/Main/docs.htm?docid=8519" target="_self">http://www.ars.usda.gov/Main/docs.htm?docid=8519</a>), a computer program that simulates the major biological and physical processes and interactions on a crop, beef, or dairy farm. The researchers found that total emissions for the greenhouse gases methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide were 8 percent lower in year-round outdoor production systems than in the high-production confinement systems. Keeping dairy cows outdoors all year lowered ammonia emissions by about 30 percent and helped reduce fuel use and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions from farm equipment. (ARS, 3/5/2011)</p>

	A new project on climate change mitigation and agricultural projects in Latin America and the Caribbean has been launched, which will bring together a consortium of research institutions and funders. The Government of New Zealand, the Inter-American Development Bank and the Regional Fund for Agricultural Technology (Fontagro, for its initials in Spanish) have signed an agreement to work together for the first time on a project to improve national greenhouse gas inventories and develop mitigation options in LAC. The research will be adapted to the farming conditions of each of the target countries: Argentina, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Uruguay.

	Stanford agricultural scientist David Lobell and researchers at CIMMYT report in the inaugural issue of <i>Nature Climate Change</i> (<a href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.nature.com/nclimate/index.html</a>) that a clear negative effect of warming on maize production was evident in experimental crop trial data conducted in Africa by the organization and its partners from 1999 to 2007. Led by Lobell, the researchers combined data from 20,000 trials in sub-Saharan Africa with weather data recorded at stations scattered across the region. They found that a temperature rise of a single degree Celsius would cause yield losses for 65 percent of the present maize-growing region in Africa - provided the crops received the optimal amount of rainfall. The data recorded at the yield testing sites did not include weather information. Instead, the researchers used data gathered from weather stations all over sub-Saharan Africa. Although the stations were operated by different organizations, all data collection was organized by the World Meteorological Organization, so the methods used were consistent. Lobell then took the available weather data and interpolated between recording stations to infer what the weather would have been like at the test sites. By merging the weather and crop data, the researchers could examine climate impacts.Source: Sciencedaily, 14 Mar. 2011, see <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110313160025.htm" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110313160025.htm </a>and The Economist, 17 Mar. 2011, see <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18386161" target="_blank">http://www.economist.com/node/18386161</a></p>

	Low-input farming for cocoa, cassava and oil palm has resulted in widespread deforestation and degredation of West Africa’s tropical forest area, according to a new study by researchers at the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR). Researchers found that increasing fertilizer use on cocoa-timber farms would have spared roughly 2 million hectares of tropical forest from being cleared or severely degraded. The study suggests that farmers could have achieved the same outputs without rampant deforestation through the intensified use of fertilizer and agrochemicals coupled with improved crop husbandry.According to IITA, by doing so farmers would have doubled their incomes and helped to avoid deforestation and degradation on 2.1 million hectares and in the process, this would have generated a value of over 1,600 million dollars on 1.3 billion tons of CO2 emissions that would not have come from deforestation. To the authors, funding support for reducing carbon emissions due to deforestation and degradation (REDD) to mitigate climate change offers the potential of significant new public resources for needed investments in agricultural research and extension and market infrastructure to support the transformation of traditional agriculture in West Africa. They suggest a significant proportion of REDD+ funding should be used to increase the adoption level of fertilizer use in a ‘Fertilizers for forest’ mitigation program.

	A new research program on 'Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security' (CCAFS) will link much of the best climate-related agricultural research for development work going on at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) and 14 other CGIAR centres with the best global environmental change research being undertaken within the global Earth System Science Partnership. The CCAFS program will be formally launched on 4 December at Agriculture and Rural Development Day at a United Nations climate change meeting. It is the most comprehensive effort undertaken thus far to address the interactions between climate change and food security, livelihoods and environmental management. Emerging from new collaboration between the CGIAR and the Earth System Science Partnership (ESSP), the program brings together strategic research carried out by the CGIAR, ESSP and their respective partners in a collective effort to be coordinated by the Colombia-based International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT). The launch of CCAFS marks the beginning of a long-term endeavour with an initial 3-year budget totalling US$206 million. (Source: ILRI, 19 November 2010).</p>
