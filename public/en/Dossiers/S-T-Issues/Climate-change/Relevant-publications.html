They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

A review" alt="link">Robust cropping systems to tackle pests under climate change. A review</a></h2>

	
					<p>This article reviews the effects of climate change on crop protection and strategies to reduce the impact of future invasive crop pests as well as those of rapidly evolving resident populations. The authors make the following points: (i) the consequence of climate change and globalization is a heightened level of unpredictability of interactions between weather, cropping systems and pests; (ii) the unpredictable adaptation of pests to a changing environment creates uncertainty and projected changes do not automatically translate into doom and gloom scenarios; (iii) faced with uncertainty, policy, research, and extension should prepare for worst-case scenarios following a ‘no regrets’ approach that promotes resilience vis-à-vis pests; (iv) farmers can take advantage of Web 2.0 and other new technologies to make the exchange of updated information quicker and easier; and (v) cooperation between historically compartmentalized experts in plant health and crop protection could help develop anticipation strategies.

					<p>Genetic resources have a critical role to play in feeding the world, especially as climate change advances faster than expected, and much more needs to be done to study, preserve and utilize the biological diversity that underpins world food production. In this new book published by the FAO the authors argue that that the ability of plants and animals raised by farmers to withstand volatile conditions and adapt when the environment changes is a direct result of their genetic diversity. However, stronger efforts are needed to study and use this diversity as a coping mechanism, and to develop policies to support it. In particular, improving knowledge, conservation and use of crop wild relatives is important. They are likely to have genetic traits that can be used to develop well-adapted crops for use in climate change-affected food systems.

					<p>Energy, water and food resource systems are fundamentally interrelated but to date the three resource systems have mostly been organised and studied separately. A 'nexus approach', a multidisciplinary type of analysis of the relationship between energy, water and food, can help to reduce trade-offs and to build synergies across these three sectors.

					<p>Although research can provide context-specific data, analysis and knowledge for climate change adaptation, yet in practice, the potential of science-practice interaction is still underdeveloped. Funds for research on climate change adaptation will considerably increase in the coming years. It is therefore important to explore ways of channelling the funds to promising research that can provide context-specific data, analysis and knowledge for climate change adaptation in low-income countries. This policy brief summarises the key findings and recommendations of an international expert workshop organised by the German Development Institute (Deutsches Institut für Entwicklungspolitik, DIE), the EU project CIRCLE-2 (Climate Impact Research &amp; Response Coordination for a Larger Europe), and the German Aerospace Centre Project Management Agency (PT-DLR). Two key recommendation are:


Extend the basis for identification of knowledge needs beyond literature review and the advice of a limited number of experts and high-level stakeholders.

Funding agencies need to provide sufficient time and resources for science-practice interaction and should reconsider its incentives structures for research.

					<p>The integration of three state-of-the-art technologies such that scientific findings and data are linked to actual user requirements including governments to achieve better decision-support for agricultural drought preparedness, has been proposed by Markus Enenkel, Vienna University of Technology, Austria and colleagues. Several promising approaches, ranging from the integration of satellite-derived soil moisture measurements that link atmospheric processes to anomalies on the land surface to improved long-range weather predictions and mobile applications are explored. Satellite-derived soil moisture measurements from space-based microwave sensors can help detect plant water deficiencies earlier than conventional products such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and forecasting models can provide seasonal predictions. These models must be calibrated to regional conditions, take into account weather uncertainties and 'hindsight' data, and be combined with crop health predictions. Mobile applications can link end users to drought-relevant information and also play a vital role in validating satellite-derived drought indicators and collecting socio-economic conditions. According to the authors, the added value of these technologies should create enough political will to ensure they find their way into the decision-support toolboxes of the end users. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Global Food Security</i>, 10/09/2014)</p>

	This report published by the SEA Change (Vietnam) and UKCIP (UK), is a synthesis and summary of frameworks for the monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) of climate change adaptation and resilience (CCAR) interventions, with a specific focus on international development projects and programmes. The objective of this report is to: (i) provide an easy-to-read synthesis of current adaptation and resilience M&amp;E resources, frameworks, and approaches so that practitioners are able to more easily identify the information and tools that are most relevant to their needs; (ii) provide a short analysis of the 'state of play' of adaptation and resilience M&amp;E guidance, identifying key themes and reflecting upon gaps and future priorities. The synthesis exposes a considerable overlap between some of these M&amp;E frameworks, but also very important differences in approach, methodology, and intended audience. Among the key findings was a strong demand for an overarching, comprehensive document that would help M&amp;E practitioners and CCAR programme managers understand the state of play of CCAR M&amp;E, and also provide guidance in choosing which materials are best suited to the needs at hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.seachangecop.org/node/3258" target="_self">SEA Change CoP</a>, 15/05/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>In this open-access article in <i>Weather and Climate Extremes</i>, Donald A. Wilhite, at the School of Natural Resources, University of Nebraska, USA, and colleagues address the growing worldwide concern about the ineffectiveness of current drought management practices. Most in-country policy and practices related to drought management are based on the principles of crisis management, resulting in the ‘reactive’ treatment of the ‘symptoms’ of drought. The authors argue that a comprehensive drought management plan must address the causes for the vulnerabilities associated with this type of extreme climatic event. They further show that through the adoption of national drought policies that are focused on risk reduction and complemented by drought mitigation or preparedness plans at various levels of government, the coping capacity of nations to manage droughts can be improved. In their paper they discuss the underlying concepts of drought, the principles and objectives of national drought policies and a drought planning process that has been effective in the preparation of drought mitigation plans. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094714000164" target="_self">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094714000164</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>Weather and Climate Extreme</i>, 18/03/2014)</p>

					<p>East African Agriculture and Climate Change: A Comprehensive Analysis<i>,</i> the second of three volumes in IFPRI's Climate Change in Africa series, examines the food security threats facing 10 countries in East and Central Africa and explores how climate change will increase the efforts needed to achieve sustainable food security throughout this region. Through the use of hundreds of scenario maps, models, figures, and detailed analysis, the editors and contributors of East African Agriculture and Climate Change present plausible future scenarios that combine economic and biophysical characteristics to explore the possible consequences for agriculture, food security, and resources management to 2050. They also offer recommendations to national governments and regional economic agencies already dealing with the vulnerabilities of climate change and deviations in environment. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.ifpri.org/publication/east-african-agriculture-and-climate-change-0" target="_self">http://www.ifpri.org/publication/east-african-agriculture-and-climate-change-0</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(IFPRI, 09/12/2013)&nbsp;</p>

					<p>‘Climate Change and Agriculture in Jamaica’ is a report by the Investment Centre Division (TCI) of the FAO and discusses options for improvements to current policy on climate change and agriculture in Jamaica. It presents current information on the vulnerability of agro-ecosystems and food production systems, past trends in climate, and impacts of climate variability on sub-sectors such as fisheries, crop suitability, water resources and erosion. The discussion addresses broader policy directions, technical alternatives and investment priorities in relation to climate change adaptation. Examples of innovative agricultural practices and policy (such as: strengthening of Research &amp; Development links; development of agriculture weather risk management; use of traditional and local knowledge to speed up adaptation planning; strengthening of data collection, monitoring and forecasting) are presented as coping strategies, along a detailed list of ongoing and completed projects/initiatives related to climate change and agriculture in Jamaica.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3417e/i3417e.pdf" target="_self">http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3417e/i3417e.pdf</a>(FAO, 09/2013)</p>

					<p>In a recent report, published in a special issue of <i>Economics</i>, the projected changes in planted area, yield per area, net exports/imports and prices for five major agricultural crops in South Africa were simulated using the projections of four Global Circulation Models (GCMs) under three socio-economic scenarios. The results indicate slightly rising to stable yields per unit area up to 2050, despite climate change, largely due to the inbuilt assumption of ongoing agronomic and genetic improvements. Policies to increase local agricultural production in South Africa, decrease climate sensitivity and access to international markets are highlighted. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.economics-ejournal.org/economics/journalarticles/2013-35" target="_self">http://www.economics-ejournal.org/economics/journalarticles/2013-35</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>Economics eJournal</i>, 02/09/2013)</p>

					<p>This CCAFS project, completed by Princeton University scientists J. Sheffield and N. Chaney, developed a daily dataset of meteorological variables for 1979–2008 for West and East Africa using&nbsp; global gridded monthly observations merged with high temporal resolution data and scaled down in space to 10 km resolution. The dataset was improved by assimilating daily station data where available. The final dataset was used to calculate indices of extreme daily values and potential evaporation, in order to demonstrate its potential, which is real, for use in climate change studies and for forcing crop models.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/33519" target="_self">http://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/33519</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(CCAFS Working Paper 45, 22/08/2013)</p>
