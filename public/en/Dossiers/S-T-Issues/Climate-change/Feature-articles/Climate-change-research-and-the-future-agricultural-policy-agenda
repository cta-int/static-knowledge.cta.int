They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

<h6>Dr Jan Verhagen, Plant Research International, Wageningen University &amp; Research Centre, The Netherlands</h6><a name="eztoc313376_0_1_1" id="eztoc313376_0_1_1"></a><h4><b>Introduction</b></h4><p>Half of the population of developing countries live in rural areas, but with the current rate of urbanisation, a dramatic shift towards urban settlements is expected by 2025 (United Nations, 2008). Whether this will result in the urbanisation of poverty or increase the incidence of rural poverty still remains unclear. Similarly, the distinction between countries is fading as the world is becoming better connected and integrated, and differences in development between groups and regions are increasing.</p><p>Poverty and hunger are strongly linked and despite considerable improvements in the food system, food security still remains a problem. The first millennium development goal (MDG) aims at halving poverty and hunger by 2015 (United Nations, 2000), and is increasingly unlikely to be met in the timeframe. Although keeping food production up to speed with current population growth is an important issue, improving food distribution and entitlement to food remain the major obstacles for poor communities to achieve food security (Evans, 1998; Smil, 2005).</p><p>An increasing population, the rise in living standards and changes in consumption patterns are increasing the associated demand for food and raw material, and also offer differing developmental opportunities for rural communities. Changing consumption and production patterns will require changes in production systems, triggering competition for water, land, labour and finance. </p><p>Currently, most developing countries’ economies are still strongly rooted in agriculture. Besides providing food and raw material for their own consumption, their economic development, income generation and employment opportunities are strongly linked to their agricultural development. Paradoxically, however, economic growth, urbanisation and poverty reduction lead to a decline in the relative importance of agriculture for national economies, often resulting in reduced political interest and investments in the sector (Dorward, 2004; Rigg, 2005).</p><p>The few options rural communities have to be part of the broader economic development agenda can be shaped around increased local, regional and international market demands, or yield increases via technological or institutional improvements to address food security goals. Working on both issues is critical for agricultural development, and therefore, poverty alleviation. How this response is shaped within the context of climate change needs to be addressed with urgency.</p><a name="eztoc313376_0_1_2" id="eztoc313376_0_1_2"></a><h4><b>Climate change and future resource based production systems</b></h4><p>Climate change is strongly connected to developmental issues, especially for economies that focus on resource based production systems such as agriculture, forestry and fisheries. Climate change alone is estimated to increase the number of undernourished people to between 5 million and 170 million (Parry, et al., 2004; Schmidhuber and Tubiello, 2007), as it threatens to reduce the effectiveness of aid and research efforts that are designed to increase crop and land productivity. It is important that adaptation to climate change is in line with development processes and objectives. Mainstreaming, integrating or aligning climate change adaptation activities to development plans and programmes are vital steps forward to increasing chances of short- and long-term success, and reduce the risk of investment loss in relation to erratic weather changes.</p><p> The world is facing many challenges; economic, financial, energy, fresh water, biodiversity, food self sufficiency and climate change, all requiring immediate and integrated action. Not only does climate change have the potential to undermine all economic, environmental and energy related activities, but also those aiming to improve food security. It can also hamper development by its impact on the natural resource base upon which agriculture depends (Halsnæs and Verhagen, 2007; IPCC 2007a).</p><p>Climate change presents the existing land-use systems with long-term problems. Floods, droughts, changes in rainfall and high temperatures have a direct impact on production capacities in all agricultural fields. Changes in productivity will also be determined by indirect effects such as salt water intrusion in coastal areas and changes in pressures on pests and diseases (IPCC 2007b).</p><p>Besides being directly impacted by climate change, agriculture is also a contributing factor to climate change as it contributes to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The agricultural sector accounts for approximately 15% of global anthropogenic gases, mainly methane and nitrous oxide. These emissions are the result of land conversion, soil and crop management and livestock husbandry. Given their low fossil-fuel consumption, the contribution of developing countries’ emission of GHGs is relatively low compared to industrialised countries (74 and 26%, respectively, Van Beek et al., 2009). However, their contribution to the net fluxes of GHGs through land use and land-use change is not negligible.</p><p>A quarter of the global carbon budget is linked to land use, deforestation and peat degradation in non-industrialised countries being other particularly significant factors. Land use, especially wetland rice, burning crop residues and rearing livestock contributes significantly to increasing atmospheric methane concentrations. Inorganic fertiliser is currently employed in agriculture in industrialised countries, and is responsible for almost all anthropogenic nitrous oxide emissions.</p><p>The required increase in agricultural production, in response to increasing populations and ever-changing diets, is predominantly to be achieved in non-industrialised countries with currently relatively low agricultural production levels. It will most likely be achieved by the intensification of agricultural production systems, which will in turn lead to a higher consumption of fossil fuels, partly related to increased mechanisation and increased use of inorganic fertiliser (Smil, 1997; FAO, 2000; Pingali, 2006). Storage, transport and processing of agricultural products also require energy and any increased use of fossil fuel will exacerbate climate change. Defining a low-emission pathway is a key challenge that has so far been neglected. Innovations, technology and knowledge exchange on managing emissions in the agricultural sector, on farms and in value chains have not received the attention needed for the sustainable development of agriculture (Oenema et al., 2001).</p><a name="eztoc313376_0_1_3" id="eztoc313376_0_1_3"></a><h4><b>Integrating climate change in agricultural development</b></h4><p>Increased competition triggered by climate change will require adjustments to production systems and institutions. At first it may seem that climate change distracts from urgent and immediate needs and adds further complexity to an already complicated development process. But for most investments in agricultural development, ignoring present climate change issues will most likely result in investment loss or decreased opportunities in the future. Combined adaptation strategies and sustainable development pathways need to aim for low vulnerability to climate change and low GHG emissions, taking into account variability and uncertainties about climate-related risks (Kok et al., 2008). </p><p>Farmers in dryland Africa are used to dealing with climate variability. Innovative technologies as part of a continuous learning process are required as a basis for success in dryland communities. In many cases, adoption of more effective farm practices and concepts such as soil and crop tillage, selection of appropriate crop variety, fertilisation and irrigation, are combined with on-farm crop and livestock experimentation (Reij and Smaling, 2008; IAASTD, 2009). These locally driven innovations and adaptation strategies are directly tailored to the needs and capacities of local communities (Dietz et al., 2004; Patt et al., 2010). The successful adoption of new technologies is mixed. The effective use of fertilisers requires access to finance and knowledge on how and when to apply them to improve productivity and knowledge on health and safety aspects related to application and traceability. Farmers have developed location-specific methods like zaï, crop residue management, manure management and use of leguminous to increase efficiencies of organic and mineral fertilisers (Ingram, 2002; Reij and Smaling, 2008). </p><p>However, research and testing of existing and developing of new adaptive technologies for agricultural practice across different climates and environmental zones will be needed to provide farmers with a viable adaptation portfolio. What is more, existing insurance schemes and early-warning systems could be improved and further adjusted to the needs of the target groups if new monitoring and evaluation methods are applied. Integrating adaptation strategies into development agendas also means acknowledging the importance of social and economic mobility within, and between, countries. Understanding how existing social security mechanisms and possible new arrangements at national, regional (e.g. rural urban linkages) and international levels (e.g. north-south and south-south) function after disastrous events (e.g. drought and floods) is particularly important for vulnerable groups (Dietz et al., 2004).</p><a name="eztoc313376_0_1_4" id="eztoc313376_0_1_4"></a><h4><b>Climate change and the future research and policy agenda</b></h4><p>Most of these issues are not new, but the pressure to deliver results in the short term, given the intensive demographic development and increasing risk of climate change, is mounting. Additionally, climate change also forces scientists, policy makers and practitioners to reassess ongoing and planned development efforts. Given the complex nature of research and development, integrating or mainstreaming climate change will require a very practical, hands-on approach, focussing on tangible consequences for policy makers and farmers alike and adequate funding. However, there remain many challenges, as the costs of adding these adaptive technologies to the already high costs of current plans and policies, remain a major barrier to implementation. For example, the low productivity of agriculture in Africa’s drylands is partly rooted in poor soils and erratic rainfall patterns that seriously undermine efforts to enhance food production. Ameliorating soil fertility in many cases cannot be done by low levels of external inputs. Combining organic and mineral inputs is already being spearheaded in most soil fertility initiatives. Farmers manage soils using accessible resources and knowledge and policies can provide incentives and access to resources via planning, prices and subsidies. Changing rainfall patterns will, however, also impact the effectiveness of investments in soil fertility, challenging current investment strategies and policies (Breman, 1990; Dietz et al., 2004).</p><p>In general, future investment strategies for areas with low agricultural potential may change in the light of climate change. Some areas could benefit and become eligible for investments while others may require a strategy in which investments are downscaled or even stopped. New capacities and skills are needed for policy makers, scientists and farmers to operationalise adaptation options, identify possible synergies and trade-offs given the uncertainties and effects of possible interventions.</p><p>Efforts to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture in developing countries have not yet been studied in great detail. This situation is in sharp contrast to efforts made in the fields of land conversion and deforestation and their impact on the carbon budget, which is already strongly embedded in the international climate agenda. It is, however, clear that the needed increase in land productivity to feed a growing population and to deal with a changing climate will require structural changes to farming systems and the way they operate. Agricultural intensification in arable crops and livestock farming will result in higher emissions of nitrous oxide and methane (FAO, 2006). A major research and policy effort is crucial in order to avoid a dramatic increase in GHG emissions. Decoupling intensification from increased emission via a more efficient production system is seen as the most viable solution (Tilman et al., 2002; van Beek et al., 2010).</p><p>The importance of organic soil matter and soil fertility in the global carbon budget is evident (Martius et al., 2001; Lal, 2008; Smith, 2008). Managing GHG emissions from agriculture via soil, crop, livestock and manure management is possible. However, the effectiveness, monitoring and verification of GHG management processes are difficult to establish and verify. In any case, payments to stabilise or reduce GHG emissions in agricultural systems could provide farmers with an incentive to redesign existing farming management strategies towards low emission agriculture (Palm et al., 2010). Payment schemes for such climate services have so far looked at conservation of carbon stocks in forests but still neglect to deal with agriculture, thereby providing opportunities for agricultural research.</p><p>Most efforts addressing climate change in developing countries focus on current needs and argue that by improving the current situation and including climate variability these improved systems are better equipped to deal with future climate change issues (OECD 2009). The need for a gradual yet complete transition may be triggered by changes in the competitiveness of countries and regions or opportunities provided by changes in the global, regional and national markets. These changes could also be part of an adaptation strategy in response to disastrous direct or indirect impacts of climate change. A possible option may be to phase out agriculture in areas that are already facing increasing hardship (e.g. droughts, floods).</p><p>In the long term, dramatically different production systems or even a complete separation from agriculture will have to be explored to exploit opportunities for economic and social development, and/or as response for avoiding disastrous impacts. New frameworks are needed to shape this long-term change, as existing frameworks predominantly focus on the short term. The integration of climate change research and national and regional social and economic development opportunities will emerge to realign short-term and long-term practices, forcing policies to make more efficient use of current science.</p><a name="eztoc313376_0_1_5" id="eztoc313376_0_1_5"></a><h4><b>Acknowledgements </b></h4><p>The work presented is based on the experiences from several climate change projects that were conducted over the last 10 years. The Impact of Climate Change on Drylands (ICCD) was among the first initiatives to address adaptation in a multi-disciplinary manner. The Development and Climate Project (www.developmentfirst.org) was designed to explore options to mainstream climate change into the development agenda. More recently, AIDA (http://www.open-si.com/) addressed the resilient and innovative nature of dryland agriculture. Wageningen-UR started a training course to develop capacities at the national and regional level for effective integration of adaptation to climate change (http://portals.wi.wur.nl/climatechange/?Climate_Change_Adaptation_Course_2010). The Dutch Ministries of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, Spatial Planning are acknowledged for funding the underlying projects.</p><a name="eztoc313376_0_1_6" id="eztoc313376_0_1_6"></a><h4><b>References</b></h4><p>
