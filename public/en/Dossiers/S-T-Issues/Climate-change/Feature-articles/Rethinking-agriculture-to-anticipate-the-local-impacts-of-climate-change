They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	<p>Given ongoing climate change, it has become essential to focus on the role of agriculture in human societies. On the one hand, current agricultural production systems, particularly in developing areas, could be overwhelmed by the scale and brutality of the expected changes; on the other hand, agriculture must now be better integrated with dealing with the global problems that arise. Success in agriculture is, at the same time, providing food, adapting and mitigating in response to climate change and providing a real way to develop countries in need. These are the challenges human societies are already facing. Climate change requires a rethinking of current practices. This paper provides answers capable of driving a real productive paradigm shift and a profound change in the role that agriculture plays in society.</p>

<h6>Thierry Giordano (Cirad, Development Bank of South Africa (DBSA)), Saphira Patel (DBSA), Olivier Hamel (Cirad, in charge of Cirad's Climate Change workgroup), Frederic Bourg (Cirad)</h6><p>-</p><p>It is a well-known fact that climate change will challenge the current world agricultural production systems, as highlighted in the Fourth Assessment Report of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, Parry <i>et al.</i>, 2007). Studies indicate that negative impacts of climate change will outweigh positive impacts, especially in agriculture (Pant, 2009). These changes will in all likelihood have the combined effect of reducing crop yields, increasing food insecurity and invalidating traditional agricultural practices. In this article, we seek to emphasize the importance of: (i) better evaluation of local impacts of climate change; (ii) (re)designing agricultural technologies and practices and climate change adaptation and mitigation measures to include diversity (Vink <i>et al.</i>, 2009), innovation and flexibility in the attempt to respond to local challenges presented by climate change; (iii) the transfer of knowledge of and about these designs, technologies, practices and measures to those who will benefit the most; and (iv) the acknowledgment that climate change is but one of the changes which are impacting on the role of agriculture in the development process, thus necessitating a much more integrated approach than is currently the case.</p><p>An effective response to the challenges posed by climate change requires an evaluation of current and anticipated impacts. It is possible to simulate broad continental, regional and national impacts with different levels of probability. Several simulation models exist; however, the estimation of local impacts is much more problematic. At the global level, two different tools can be combined to evaluate climate change impacts on agriculture. A first step is to determine what the characteristics of regional climate patterns might be in the future, using the following three main parameters: changes in temperature; changes in precipitation patterns; and frequency and intensity of extreme events. A second step is to use these results and apply them to an agricultural production model, using the mechanisms through which climate shapes agricultural production patterns. For instance, water stress (drought or water excess) and thermal stress (heat or cold) might have large impacts on plant production by disrupting the phenology (foliation, flowering, life cycle, etc.), growth and yield (size, number and quality of fruits/grains) of plants and their spatial distribution. Animal production would also be disrupted through the disruption to feedstock production; the distribution and spread/propagation of emerging diseases could also impact both plant and animal production (Arzt <i>et al.</i>, 2010). Recently, by coupling these two approaches, the International Food Policy Research Institute estimated the impact of climate change on sub-Saharan African agriculture and stated the following: “<i>Crop yields will decline, production will be affected, crop and meat prices will increase, and consumption of cereals will fall, leading to reduced calorie intake and increased child malnutrition.</i>” (Nelson <i>et al.</i>, 2009). This dismal future calls for immediate and co-ordinated actions that combine mitigation and adaptation.</p><p>Firstly, adaptation measures need to be developed, disseminated and implemented for agricultural production to cope with changing and growing food and non-food demands. This is in all likelihood the most daunting task, as many impediments punctuate the shift from short-term to long-term prospective measures. The first set of challenges relates to the lack of knowledge about the local impact of climate change. Global climate models are unreliable, and therefore totally irrelevant, in predicting impacts at the local level in the medium- to long-term. An example of this lack of knowledge stems from current methods that aim to identify the impacts of climate change on the local agricultural production system where researchers use a two-scenario model, a wet and a dry one (Arndt <i>et al.</i>, 2010). A great deal of work is required in this respect.</p><p>In many developing countries, farmers are already, in many instances informally, implementing adaptation strategies to climate change as part of their overall risk management strategy (Cradock-Henry, 2008). However, these adaptation strategies will most likely be insufficient to counter the coming changes in temperature, rain and extreme events: these strategies are based on the farmer’s own experiences, i.e. the natural variability of the climate as perceived or recorded over recent decades. While such strategies are satisfactory for decision-making with short-term impacts, they become highly inappropriate in the context of climate change and when threshold effects exist which lead to major abrupt changes, and/or when long-term investment decisions have to be made as part of the adaptation strategy. Consequently, major efforts should be made to tackle these uncertainties around climate change impacts, as they might compromise both the food security and the sustainability of industrial crop production. The high impacts on local economies should wherever possible be translated into risks, or quantified when they appear irreducible, and then managed in an appropriate way using adaptation measures (Thurlow, 2010).</p><p>Secondly, mitigation actions to reduce greenhouse gas emission should be undertaken. While their global effect will depend on the intensity of the world collective commitment, one must acknowledge that agriculture needs to play a role in the mitigation effort. According to the IPCC, 10-12% of the global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions come from agricultural production, and an additional 17% are attributed to deforestation. The remaining 70% or so stems from energy-related activities (energy supply, transport and industries, Metz <i>et al.</i>, 2007). It is therefore evident that agriculture is a key target sector for the implementation of climate-change mitigation measures and ambitious action plans could be launched immediately within the sector. Reducing the energy intensity of agriculture offers some possibilities. For instance, conservation tillage or zero tillage contributes to energy saving, as does better management of agricultural inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides. Carbon sequestration and the creation of carbon sinks are also options, with agroforestry systems often being mentioned as a major opportunity in this regard. Avoiding or displacing carbon emissions through the use of bioenergy or the prevention of deforestation constitute additional routes. These are only a few of the many mitigation opportunities which exist (Metz <i>et al.</i>, 2007). A major concern relates to the increasing demand for food and non-food agricultural products as the world population grows. Responding to this global demand is probably the major impediment preventing agriculture and forestry from playing a larger role in mitigating climate change.</p><p>The second set of challenges deals with the ability to transfer this knowledge to those who need it because (i) most of the population in developing countries, sometimes more than 70% are dependent on agriculture, in particular rain-fed agriculture (World Bank, 2007); (ii) the majority are poor and already highly vulnerable to external shocks, especially climate-related shocks; (iii) poor farmers have fewer options than wealthier ones in adapting their agricultural production systems to external shocks (Brown and Funk, 2008). However, a range of adaptation measures are readily available. For instance, certain irrigation practices, such as micro-irrigation, might be relevant to reduce the vulnerability of farmers to changing rain patterns, including the use of water-saving irrigation techniques as the competition for water increases (Burte <i>et al.</i>, 2009). Such practices should, therefore, be made accessible to or adapted to the needs of the poor and vulnerable. In addition there are tools available to predict the most viable distribution and dispersion of plants. Such tools assist farmers when deciding what to grow; this is particularly important for perennial production (Engler and Guisan, 2009). Agroforestry could also be used to help with the integration of human activities into the environment and create local capacities in relation to climate regulation. Agroforestry practices lead to the emergence of micro-climates, which will both initiate changes in practices and enable farmers to adapt to regional changes (CTA, 2010).</p><p>Other measures, such as the development of improved plant varieties adapted to new local climate features, require further research. The development of plants more resistant to drought (in arid zones) or salinity (in coastal areas) also becomes an important issue in those places where these problems may become even more pressing. The provision of environmental goods and services is also a promising option as they might play a key role in reducing the vulnerability of local populations. This is primarily because forests reduce the strength of winds; mangroves protect coastal areas from higher and stronger waves and trees lower urban temperatures during heat waves, etc. Thus, key research questions relate to the evaluation of their contribution to climate-change adaptation and to the way payments for environmental services may be generated and sustained (Locatelli and Vignola, 2009). Adaptation possibilities do not relate only to climate change; instead they should be seen as part of the need to ensure that the maximum amount of arable land could be used productively for agricultural purposes with the aim of meeting the global demand. Thereby, adaptation techniques for tomorrow’s climate-related challenges are already part of the solution for today’s difficulties. For instance, how to exploit lands that are unfit for cultivation or to improve the productivity of marginal lands? Here, some cultivation practices such as direct seeding on plant cover (semis direct sur <i>couverture</i><b> </b><i>végétale or </i>SCV) are interesting, because techniques that respect soils (protection of soil surface with permanent cover, no tillage) also contribute to improving its effectiveness. Similarly, the issue of urban wood energy supply requires exploration and projects such as Makala (agroforestry and wood energy in peri-urban areas in central Africa) should be investigated (<a href="http://makala.cirad.fr/le_projet" target="_self">http://makala.cirad.fr/le_projet</a>). </p><p>A fourth challenge focuses on the political will or ability to develop and implement consistent and effective agricultural mitigation or adaptation strategies when the situation is evolving. The issue around land rights is particularly illustrative. Lands rights are crucial for the development and profitability of agroforestry systems, where farmers operate within a timeframe ranging from ten to fifty years, sometimes even more. Agroforestry is therefore an intergenerational investment, yet millions of forest-dependent people, who live and use its products, have no legal rights to the plots they farm. The issue of land is therefore essential as it defines the terms of the relationship between human and natural resources by determining who can use which resources, for what purpose and for how long. Communities assured that they are able to benefit from their land over a dedicated period of time will be more interested in developing sustainable practices, including improving soil fertility. This implies that a sufficient security of land tenure is required in order to prevent competing uses (Karsenty, 2008).</p><p>However, we should not forget that for many countries, populations and farmers, climate change represents just another layer of challenges amongst the many that they are already facing on the daily basis. A move away from short-term to integrated polices is required primarily because climate change is not occurring within a vacuum. On one hand, population growth (especially in Africa), rapid urbanization, changes in the food consumption patterns, competition for land (biofuels) and water (agriculture, energy, industries and human consumption) and other natural resources; as well as the socio-political environment all need to be considered when determining the future local-level agricultural production patterns; on the other, adaptation and mitigation actions might entail displacement of production areas and populations (De Sherbinin <i>et al.</i>, 2010). The changes imply a rethink of the role of agriculture in the development process of many developing countries (Arbache <i>et al.</i>, 2009). This new positioning of agriculture, and its related practices, will directly affect and inform the adaptation and mitigation measures that should be implemented in an attempt to respond to challenges presented by climate change. Thus it is evident that the impacts and risks posed by climate change on agricultural production will not be effectively managed or mitigated without an integrated action plan for agricultural development in which adaptation and mitigation strategies are embedded within the local spatial planning, economic, social and political context. Then, in order to develop a comprehensive action plan, we should include at least three points:</p>
<ul>

<li>The definition of an agricultural and forestry development policy in each agro-ecoregion, taking into account potential climate change and available production systems, that should be compatible with changing land tenure systems and population organizations (including the transfer of management of natural resources for the benefit of populations);</li>

<li>Consolidation of these policies as part or at least within the framework of a land plan, consistent with communities needs;</li>

<li>The definition of specifications that addresses the terms and methods that will be respected by all development actors (private or public) in order to induce synergies, at least on the basic territories unit, and, if possible, in order to maintain consistency in each ecoregion.</li>
