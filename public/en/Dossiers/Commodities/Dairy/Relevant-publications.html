They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>The ‘ROBUSTMILK’ project gives guidance as to how selection for robustness in cows might be achieved to develop the dairy industry. There are good opportunities to achieve improvements both in milk quality traits (for milk and milk products as part of a healthy diet) and for a variety of traits that contribute to ‘robustness’. The partners in the project have shown that mid infra-red spectroscopy has potential for rapid phenotypic screening of relevant traits. Data can be interlinked on whole animal phenotypes from different locations, nationally and internationally. This will help as the costs of managing resources for whole animal phenotyping continue to rise. &nbsp;<i>(Advances in Animal Biosciences,&nbsp;2013)</i></p>

					<p>In this paper Catherine Kilelu and colleagues of Wageningen University, The Netherlands, conceptualise innovation platforms as intermediaries that connect the different actors in innovation systems in order to foster effective co-evolution. To illustrate their arguments the authors use a case study of a smallholder dairy development programme in Kenya, led by a consortium of five organisations that provide a platform for building multi-actor partnerships to enhance smallholder dairy productivity and improve livelihoods. They show that co-evolution of innovation is a highly dynamic process with various interactional tensions and unexpected effects, and that the distributed nature of intermediation is important in resolving some of these tensions emerging at different actor interfaces. However, platforms are not always able to adapt adequately to emerging issues. Mechanisms such as reflexive monitoring that strengthen feedback, learning and adaptive management in innovation processes are crucial.(<i>Agricultural Systems</i>, 2013&nbsp;)</p>

					<p>Adoption and associated profitability of advanced breeding technologies are analysed for US dairy farms. The correlation and selection associated with breeding technology adoption decisions is considered. The bivariate probit model with selection is used to model adoption decisions and least squares with extended correction terms is used for profit, productivity, and cost equations. Results show that more specialised farms with younger, more educated operators having longer planning horizons are more likely to adopt advanced breeding technologies. Artificial insemination positively impacted farm profit and negatively impacted cost of milk production, while advanced breeding technologies positively impacted milk produced per cow. &nbsp;&nbsp;(AgBioForum,&nbsp;2013) &nbsp;</p>

					<p>Panel data collected from 874 farmers over 2 periods of time were used to analyse the dynamics of uptake of dairy technologies. This analysis suggests that large land holdings may be needed for continuous uptake, while smaller farms are able to keep improved cattle, but may not always be able to maintain the animals due to land and/or cash constraints. Formal milk marketing outlets have a positive effect on farmers’ decisions to keep improved cattle, and farmers in areas with fewer formal marketing outlets increase their level of inputs such as concentrates feeding, suggesting that the alternative channels offer more profitable returns. Farmers therefore seem to adjust rapidly to the changes in the marketing options and additional analysis is needed to better comprehend the relationship between market liberalisation and dairy intensification.<i>&nbsp;</i>(International Association ofAgricultural Economists Conference,&nbsp;2006)</p>

By monitoring and understanding the individual cow and herd behaviour, farmers can potentially identify the onset of illness, lameness or other undesirable health conditions. However, the WSN implementation needs to cope with various technical challenges before it can be suitably and routinely applied in cow management.

This paper focuses on the relationship between AMS and the role of the stockperson. Although AMS reduces the need for labour in the milking parlour and in theory creates freedom and flexibility for the farmer, in practice farmers found their work routines changed rather than lessened.

					<p>Traditional methods of fermenting milk involve indigenous microorganisms, leading to a variety of tastes in fermented milk products. <i>Kivuguto</i> is a fermented milk product, which is popular in Rwanda, produced by traditional spontaneous acidification of raw milk by a microflora present both on utensils and containers used for milk preservation and in the near environment of cattle. Thus, this method does not allow the shelf stability of the product. Modern dairies now produce fermented milk and other dairy products using exotic strains. The main objectives of this paper are firstly, to provide documentation on the traditional production of kivuguto, as well as its by-products, and secondly, to describe the current situation of the dairy industry in Rwanda. &nbsp;(Biotechnologie, Agronomie, Société et Environnement, 2013)</p>

					<p>Automatic Milking Systems (AMS) were developed in Europe and introduced to the USA in 2000. There are currently 10 dairy farms in Michigan using robotic milking technology. This paper summarises the experiences of dairy farmers in the Upper Midwest with robotic milking technology. Information was gathered from interviews with dairy farmers using robotic milking systems, and other discussions with producers and industry personnel working with AMS. &nbsp;The ability to milk 3 times per day without increasing labour and lower vet bills resulting from less mastitis were big advantages. However, maintenance costs and breakdowns in the setup phase were significant problems. &nbsp;&nbsp;(Michigan Dairy Review,&nbsp;2012)</p>

					<p>An infrared radiation temperature study was carried out at an experimental cowshed (120 cows) using a thermal image scanner. The temperature distribution pattern was estimated and analysed with SmartView software: particularly udder, feet and areas with skin injuries. The radiation temperature of healthy udder did not change considerably after milking. Automatic monitoring of udder temperature is possible not only in milking parlours or milking robots but also elsewhere. The udder thermograms enable assessment of milking hygiene, as the cleanliness of udder surface influences average temperature. The temperature of legs was lowest at the hooves and highest at the coronary band. Temperature differences may be used for estimation of leg disorders. Thermal images can help detect skin injuries. Radiation temperature of injured and depilous locations was higher by several degrees than their surroundings. &nbsp;&nbsp;(Agronomy Research, 2012)</p>

					<p>The viability of probiotic cells is crucial because to have their beneficial effects on health, they must stay alive until they reach their site of action. However, survivability of probiotic bacteria in dairy foods is problematic because of various physical and chemical factors. This has encouraged development of different innovative methods to improve probiotic cell viability in the product. Microencapsulation of probiotic bacteria is one of these and can be used to enhance and improve the viability during processing and also in gastrointestinal tract. However, the microencapsulation process and the chemical conditions prevailing in milk products and in human gut pose challenges.

In addition, the report provides information that can be used: (i) to estimate the environmental impact of the livestock sector; (ii) to develop diets and feeding strategies to reduce the carbon footprint and to optimise milk composition; (iii) to enhance animal productivity, health and welfare; (iv) to increase the quality and safety of animal products; and (v) to improve economic sustainability of milk production. The report was compiled by three organisations (IDF, FAO and IFCN) each of which undertook a separate but complementary approach to map dairy feeding systems around the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;(FAO, 10/2014)</p>
