They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Big data could help protect stocks of tuna and swordfish that have fallen by 90% since the 1950s. Until now, efforts to stop illegal fishing have been more or less futile. The oceans are vast, and navies and coastguard patrols are small. However, it is now feasible to synthesize information from sources such as radio transponders and satellite observations, in order to track every ocean-going vessel that is, or might be, a fishing boat. Such data can show when a vessel is behaving suspiciously in a prohibited area. They can also link particular vessels with the receiving ships to which they transfer their catches for transport to market. However, this promising use of big data system will work only if governments enforce existing rules. (<i>The Economist</i>, 23/01/2015)</p>

					<p>The large tuna resources of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean are delivering great economic benefits to Pacific Island countries and territories through sale of licences to distant fishing nations and employment in fish processing. However, tuna needs to contribute to Pacific Island societies in another important way – by increasing local access to the fish required for good nutrition to help combat the world’s highest levels of diabetes and obesity. In this study, Johann D. Bell of SPC’s Fisheries, Aquaculture and Marine Ecosystems Division, New Caledonia, and colleagues argue that tuna should also be used to enhance nutrition and diets. They demonstrate that in 2020 and 2035 just 2.1% and 5.9% of the average present-day industrial tuna catch will be required to fill the gap in domestic fish supply. They describe various policies and programmes that promise to increase access to fish for sustaining the health of the Pacific’s growing populations.

					<p>A sustainable and commercially viable aquaculture production for Atlantic Bluefin Tuna is possible based on results of the EU-funded project TRANSDOTT, which was completed in September 2014. The project built on several previous projects, such as the development of a hormone-based method to make fish reproduce in captivity. It also involved scaling up tuna production and making the endeavour economically viable. Some problems needed to be tackled first: to make the aquaculture more sustainable. Fish-based feed was step-by-step replaced by vegetable feed, to overcome cannibalism and to prevent wall collisions due to poor eye-sight. Some experts believe the best course of action for the Bluefin is to reduce the quotas to let the wild populations increase to some approximation of their original size. &nbsp;&nbsp;(CommNet, 04/07/2014)</p>

					<p>Researchers from universities in California, Hawaii and New Hamsphire have analysed contemporary and fossil coral reef ecosystem data sets from two Caribbean locations and from five Indo-Pacific locations. Working together in the working group <i>Tropical Coral Reefs of the Future: Modelling Ecological Outcomes from the Analyses of Current and Historical Trends, </i>they built a trait-based dynamic model to explore ecological performance of coral reef ecosystems in a warmer future. They found a subset of coral species that is fast-growing, phenotypically smaller and wider, and more stress-resistant and that readily produces offspring. Much is still unknown about how this subset functions, but their research reveals a range of nuanced outcomes for tropical reef corals other than near-complete loss of live coral cover in the face of warmer oceans. &nbsp;&nbsp;(UCSB, 01/10/2014)</p>

					<p>Scientists of the EU-funded project Enviguard are developing a real-time monitoring system for offshore aquacultures, to warn fish and shellfish farmers about impending diseases in time. Applied on a moored buoy, the small device undertakes the same functions as a fully equipped laboratory to detect the presence of toxic microalgae, viruses and chemical contaminants. Three different sensors can allow a simultaneous monitoring of the different threats. With this technology fish farmers can prevent epidemics in their aquacultures. &nbsp;&nbsp;(Partnership for African Fisheries, 07/10/2014)</p>

					<p>Fish stocks in the Pacific are so low that some species should no longer be fished. In particular, the survival of the Pacific bluefin and the bigeye tuna are at risk. In an interview with Phys.org on 3 September 2014, Glenn Hurry, the outgoing director of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) observed that fish stocks have rapidly diminished in the past four years. The situation is not yet unrecoverable, but stocks are at a dangerously low level and worsening, and it is time for tough decisions. Japan's recent plan to propose a 50% cut on catches of young bluefin tuna in the western and central Pacific marks an historic shift aimed at safeguarding the at-risk species. &nbsp;&nbsp;(Phys.org, 03/09/2014)</p>

					<p>Two genetically improved tilapia strains (GIFT and Akosombo) have been created with <i>Oreochromis niloticus</i> (Nile tilapia), which is native to Africa. In particular, GIFT has been shown to be significantly superior to local African tilapia strains in terms of growth rate. This study, by Yaw B. Ansah and colleagues, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, USA, reviews the history of the GIFT technology, and identifies potential environmental and genetic risks of improved and farmed strains and tilapia in general. The study also estimates the potential economic gains from the introduction of genetically improved strains in Africa, using Ghana as a case country. Employing a combination of the economic-surplus model and Monte Carlo simulation, the study found the mean net present value (NPV) of the introduction of the GIFT strain in Ghana to be approximately 1% of the country’s gross domestic product. It concludes that improvements in management practices and infrastructure could increase the yield and profitability of the local strains even if genetically improved strains are not introduced. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Sustainability</i>, 26/06/2014)</p>

					<p>How the current interconnections between the aquaculture, crop, livestock, and fisheries sectors act as an impediment to, or an opportunity for, enhanced resilience in the global food system given increased resource scarcity and climate change are explored in this paper. The researchers, Max Troell of the Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm and colleagues, use an innovative framework called Portfolio theory to analyse how growth in aquaculture and diversifying food production may enhance the ability of the global food system to meet future demands under changing conditions. They found that aquaculture can potentially enhance resilience through improved resource use efficiencies and increased diversification of farmed species, locales of production, and feeding strategies. However, the reliance of aquaculture on terrestrial crops and wild fish for feeds, its dependence on freshwater and land for culture sites, and its broad array of environmental impacts diminish its ability to increase resilience. As demand for high-value fed aquaculture products grows, competition for these crops will also rise, as will the demand for wild fish as feed inputs. Although the diversification of global food production systems that includes aquaculture offers promise for enhanced resilience, such promise will not be realised if government policies fail to provide adequate incentives for resource efficiency, equity, and environmental protection. &nbsp;&nbsp;(Stockholm Resilience Centre, 21/08/2014)</p>

					<p>The Namibia Minister of Fisheries and Marine Resources, Bernard Esau has urged all fishing companies that have not yet installed the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) of the ministry to do so urgently. The VMS, that monitors activities of fishing vessels at sea, was acquired and installed in 2002, but became obsolete over the years and was unable to perform to the ministry’s satisfaction. The ministry then started to explore possibilities of upgrading the system to acceptable international standard and acquired the present system. With the upgraded system the ministry is now able to track all licensed fishing vessels operating both in Namibian, as well as in international waters. The VMS supplements monitoring, control and surveillance through area control and science by way of the mapping of fleet dynamics. &nbsp;(<a href="http://www.newera.com.na/2014/03/17/fisheries-monitoring-system-unveiled/" target="_self"><i>New Era</i> Namibia</a>, 17/03/2014) &nbsp;</p>

					<p>Olapade Olufemi Julius, lecturer in Aquaculture and Fisheries Management at Njala University, Sierra Leone and Regional Coordinator at CORAF/WECARD, describes the recently launched fish-cum-rice, piggery and poultry production project (SIARP) in Sierra Leone. Through the introduction of appropriate technological interventions compatible with grassroots experience, it is hoped that this integrated agriculture and aquaculture technology will sustain judicious and economical use of water, land and other resources. Within such systems, the components in the farm's nutrient cycle are used more efficiently. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://goo.gl/zg9Ijm" target="_self">http://goo.gl/zg9Ijm</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(DRUSSA, 24/01/2014)</p>

					<p>Dalal Al-Abdulrazzak and Daniel Pauly of the University of British Columbia, Canada, looked at recent technological advances that could help with the monitoring of fishery catches. Statistics submitted by countries to the FAO frequently neglect or under-report the contribution of small-scale fisheries, as well as illegal catches and discards. Trying to tackle this problem, the researchers have used freely available global satellite imagery via Google Earth, to count intertidal fishing weirs off the coast of six countries in the Persian Gulf. Combining the number of weirs with assumptions about daily catches and the length of the fishing season they estimated that the fishing gear contributed to a regional catch is up to six times higher than the officially reported catches. These results provide the first example of fisheries catch estimates from space, and point to the potential for remote-sensing approaches to validate catch statistics in fisheries. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/11/27/icesjms.fst178.1" target="_self">http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/11/27/icesjms.fst178.1</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>ICES Journal of Marine Science</i>, 17/09/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Jessica Blythe and colleagues from the University of Victoria, Canada draw on case study research in Mozambique that combines national landings statistics and career history interviews with fish harvesters to generate a historical description of social-ecological interactions within the coastal Mozambican fishery. At the national level, the analysis points toward trends of fishing intensification and decline in targeted species, and it highlights the significant impact of small-scale fisheries on marine stocks. At the local level, fishermen are experiencing changes in fish abundance and distribution and in their physical, social, and cultural environments, and have responded by increasing their fishing effort (with bigger nets and bigger boats). Implication of these findings for future governance point to a need to better understand the socio-ecological drivers of change in fishing behaviour of coastal communities.
