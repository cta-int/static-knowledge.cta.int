They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>The Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) has released an e-book analysing the vulnerability of Pacific fisheries to climate change which includes contributions from 88 international scientists and fisheries specialists. The book was launched on the sidelines of the seventh Conference of the Pacific Community, which convened from 7 – 8 November 2011, in Noumea, New Caledonia. It predicts that ocean acidification and loss of important habitats, such as coral reefs, seagrass beds, mangroves and intertidal flats, will dramatically decrease the fish and shellfish that support many coastal communities. Communities are instead predicted to become more reliant on rich tuna resources. Freshwater fisheries are predicted to be 'winners' with the book outlining expected improvements in freshwater pond aquaculture. However, the publication notes that improved aquaculture will not be able to feed the rapidly increasing population.</p>

					<p>This paper from the WorldFish Centre examines the potential of small fish in fighting hidden hunger. Small fish are a common food and an integral part of the everyday diets of many population groups in poor countries. These populations also suffer from undernutrition, including micronutrient deficiencies (the hidden hunger). Studies in rural Bangladesh and Cambodia showed that small fish made up 50–80% of total fish intake in the peak fish production season. Small fish are a preferred food, supplying multiple essential nutrients and with positive perceptions for nutrition, health and well-being. As many small fish species are eaten whole, they are particularly rich in calcium, and some are also rich in vitamin A, iron and zinc. In areas with fisheries resources and habitual fish intake, there is good scope to include micronutrient-rich small fish in agricultural policy and programmes, thereby increasing intakes which can lead to improved nutrition and health.

					<p>This overview report, compiled in November 2011 for the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, addresses opportunities for the development of the Pacific Islands’ mariculture sector in general terms. More specific analysis of opportunity in particular countries is presented in the five accompanying country reports (Cook Islands, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Republic of the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands). One conclusion states: ‘Despite substantial efforts and large injections of research and development (R&amp;D) finance, mariculture development in Pacific Island nations has been very limited. This is explained by the nature of mariculture, the manner in which mariculture has been promoted, and a range of more specific practical and economic constraints. Lessons have not been learned. In particular some R&amp;D organisations and government fisheries departments have repeatedly promoted development trials without undertaking the most basic analysis of production and marketing costs. Risks have not been assessed, and there has been a failure to compare objectively mariculture with existing and other potential income generating activities. As a result many small communities have served as guinea pigs for the testing of ambitious, technically driven and in many cases naïve projects.’ (<a href="http://www.spc.int/images/publications/en/Divisions/Fisheries/en-mariculture-report.pdf" target="_blank">SPC</a>, 3/2012)</p>

					<p>The diversity of small-scale fisheries in developing countries means that context-specific assessments are required to understand and address shortcomings in their governance. This <a href="http://www.worldfishcenter.org/publications/wealth-rights-resilience-agenda-governance-reform-small-scale-fisheries " target="_blank">article</a>, published in <i>Development Policy Review </i>(Volume 30, Issue 4, July 2012) contrasts three perspectives on governance reform focused alternately on wealth, rights and resilience, and argues that – far from being incompatible – these perspectives serve as useful counterweights to one another, and together can serve to guide policy responses. In order to better appreciate the diversity in governance contexts for small-scale fisheries, the authors put forward a simple analytical framework focused on stakeholder representation, distribution of power, and accountability, and then outlines principles for identifying and deliberating reform options among local stakeholders. </p>

					<p>Giant clams offer small holders throughout the Indo-Pacific with good prospects for commercial culture to satisfy their increasing dependence on the cash economy. Two species appear promising for an emerging village-based export industry in Solomon Islands. These species are <i>Tridacna crocea</i>, the preferred species for the aquarium market, and <i>T. derasa</i>, the species that has the best potential for the seafood market. In this <a href="http://purl.umn.edu/125108" target="_blank">paper</a> (presented at the 2002 conference of the Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society), a bioeconomic model is used in a normative analysis to explore optimal-management strategies for village farmers producing these clams.

					<p>This study examines the vulnerability of fish production in Uganda, particularly as it relates to the predicted impacts from climate change, using the concept of the value chain. The value chain approach has been recommended as a useful tool to study specific challenges facing a sector resulting from various drivers of change, including climate. Critically, such analyses can reveal context-specific response strategies to enhance a sector. The specific purpose of the study was to identify current and potential impacts of climate change and corresponding adaptation strategies in fish value chains. The study builds upon information from earlier value chain analyses on fisheries and aquaculture production in Uganda to provide a more in-depth understanding of issues facing the fish industry.(<a href="http://www.worldfishcenter.org/publications/impacts-climate-change-variability-fish-value-chains-uganda" target="_blank">WorldFish Centre Research report 2012-18</a>, 6/2012)</p>

					<p>Although disease is a major threat to aquaculture production, the underlying global epidemiological patterns are unknown. This research analysed disease outbreak severity across different latitudes in a diverse range of aquaculture systems. It found that disease at lower latitudes progresses more rapidly and results in higher cumulative mortality, in particular at early stages of development and in shellfish. Tropical countries suffer proportionally greater losses in aquaculture during disease outbreaks and have less time to mitigate losses. The authors believe that as the incidences of some infectious diseases may increase with climate change, adaptation strategies must consider global patterns in disease vulnerability of aquaculture. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.une.edu.au/staff/tleung/2012-leung-bates-more-rapid-and-severe-disease.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.une.edu.au/staff/tleung/2012-leung-bates-more-rapid-and-severe-disease.pdf</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Journal of Applied Ecology</i>, 5/12/2012)</p>

					<p>This review led by Albert O. Amosu of the University of the Western Cape, depicts the South African seaweed aquaculture industry. Seaweeds are one of &nbsp;South Africa’s most important aquaculture products, constituting an important fish feed source and biomass for biofuel production. To mitigate for the &nbsp;reliance on wild harvesting, the South African seaweed aquaculture industry has built many on-land integrated culture units (preferred method for the &nbsp;industry). This growth has paralleled the rise of the abalone industry, and has been successful largely because of bilateral technology transfer and &nbsp;innovation between commercial abalone farms and research institutions. The authors believe the successful development provides a template abroad to &nbsp;help other countries further their aquaculture sector. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.academicjournals.org/journal/AJAR/article-abstract/5C21AA041673" target="_self">http://www.academicjournals.org/journal/AJAR/article-abstract/5C21AA041673</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>African Journal of Agricultural Research</i>, 11/2013) &nbsp;</p>

					<p>This new joint report by World Bank, FAO, and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) on the prospect for fisheries and aquaculture shows that fish farming will provide close to two thirds of global food fish consumption by 2030. It estimates that catches from wild capture fisheries will level off while demand from an emerging global middle class will increase substantially. Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to see a <i>per capita</i><i>fish consumption</i> decline of 1 % per year from 2010 to 2030 but, due to rapid population growth of 2.3 % in the same period, the region's <i>total fish consumption </i>will grow by 30 % overall. By 2030, 62 % of food fish will come from aquaculture with the fastest supply growth likely to come from tilapia, carp, and catfish. Threats from large-scale disease outbreaks in aquaculture and climate change-related impacts could dramatically alter this, and the potential of small scale aquaculture must be exploited. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/213522/icode/" target="_self">http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/213522/icode/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ifpri.org/pressrelease/fish-farms-produce-nearly-two-thirds-global-food-fish-supply-2030-report-shows" target="_self">http://www.ifpri.org/pressrelease/fish-farms-produce-nearly-two-thirds-global-food-fish-supply-2030-report-shows</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(FAO and IFPRI, 05/02/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>A fishing trip analysis shows that catch and profitability are higher when public fish aggregation devices (FADs) are managed privately or by small groups and access to the aggregated fisheries resources is somewhat restricted. In partnership with Counterpart International, the Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism, the Dominica and St. Vincent and the Grenadines Fisheries Divisions and the Florida Sea Grant collected information from fishermen on their use of FADs that were deployed privately, by small groups or by the government. This allowed for a determination of governance arrangements that were most profitable and provided input to stakeholder meetings with FAD fishers to identify best practices for sustainably using and co-managing FADs. An engagement strategy that introduced an activity planner as a best practice to increase information sharing helped strengthen the rapport between government and fisheries stakeholders. &nbsp;&nbsp;(CRFM, 07/10/2014)</p>

					<p>The report <i>Status and Trends of Caribbean Coral Reefs: 1970-2012</i> is the most detailed and comprehensive study of its kind published to date and represents the work of 90 experts over the course of three years. It contains an analysis of more than 35,000 surveys conducted at 90 Caribbean locations since 1970, including studies of corals, seaweeds, grazing sea urchins and fish. The results show that the Caribbean corals have declined by more than 50% since the 1970s. But according to the authors, restoring parrotfish populations and improving other management strategies, such as protection from overfishing and excessive coastal pollution, could help the reefs recover and make them more resilient to future climate change impacts. This latest report was produced by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network (GCRMN), the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). &nbsp;<a href="http://caribbeanclimateblog.com/2014/07/02/coral-reefs-report-and-climate-change-news/" target="_self">http://caribbeanclimateblog.com/2014/07/02/coral-reefs-report-and-climate-change-news/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.iucn.org/?uNewsID=16056" target="_self">http://www.iucn.org/?uNewsID=16056</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Report: <a href="http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/caribbean_coral_reefs___status_report_1970_2012.pdf" target="_self">http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/caribbean_coral_reefs___status_report_1970_2012.pdf</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(Caribbean Climate Blog, 07/2014)</p>
