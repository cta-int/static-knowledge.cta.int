						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>B. K. Gebremeskel. Thesis Submitted to Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia. 2010.Rice is a new crop for Ethiopia in general and the study area, Metema, in particular. There is an immense potential rice production area and high consumer demand. However, the rice sector is underdeveloped. Many institutional, organizational and technological factors were attributed to existing inefficiencies in rice production and utilization.There are multiple public and non-public actors involved along the rice value chain, upstream from input supply to downstream consumers, playing different roles but little coordination or linkage. Lack of post-harvest processing technology (rice polisher), limited access to and supply of inputs, severe termite attack, non-availability of well-developed rice market, high labour demand for crop management, absence of coordinating responsible body are challenges to innovation.On the contrary, increased farmer’s awareness about and availability of improved rice varieties, existence of favourable land and climatic condition, presence of high consumer demand, and increased institutional support from different GOs and NGOs were mentioned as opportunities for innovation. Platforms and partnerships have to be created between value chain actors to create an enabling environment for sharing of information, knowledge and solving existing problems such as shortage of rice polisher technology and input supply services.</p>

					<p>D.C. Wilcock and F. Jean-Pierre. Oxfam America, Washington DC, USA. 2011.An analysis of the rice value chain highlights the importance of public-private partnerships in targeted applied technology research and development. With better value chain coordination, improved national rice trade and other policies, and improved extension of productivity-increasing technologies, Haiti could increase the proportion of national production that contributes to domestic rice consumption from the current 20% to 50 or 60% over the next 10 to 15 years.The report advocates agricultural research (including biological and agromechanical technologies) involved in varietal selection and the applied agronomy of production. The interest that has been shown recently in the SRI approach to improving rice profitability for farmers is a good example of opportunities that are present. Application of food technology to rice parboiling issues could assist.</p>

The World Bank, Washington DC, USA. 2011.Agricultural innovation in Africa needs to internalize the region’s biophysical, institutional, and socioeconomic constraints and establish efficient value chains to support sustainable growth and reduce poverty. Agricultural research can catalyze agricultural innovation and the development of the value chain. A prime example is the New Rice for Africa (NERICA) varieties developed by the Africa Rice Center (AfricaRice) and partners, which gained popularity among Africa’s rice farmers in a relatively short period of time.3 NERICA varieties were developed from crosses between the African species Oryza glaberrima Steud. and the Asian species O. sativa using conventional biotechnology to overcome the sterility barrier between the two species. The history, development, and impact of NERICA are described with recommendations about its expansion.</p>

					<p>J. M. Kimani, P. Tongoona, J. Derera and A.B.Nyende. ARPN Journal of Agricultural and Biological Science 6(9): 39-49. 2011.Farmers’ participation during variety development and selection can promote adoption of the released cultivars and their contribution to an improved value chain. A survey and discussions were conducted in the major rice production areas in Kenya, to obtain information on varietal preferences and production constraints.To ensure farmers desired traits were firmly anchored in the breeding programme, an on station research managed parent selection trial was established where farmers were involved in assisting the selection of lines to be used as parents based on their own selection criteria. The farmers’ preferences were high yielding and good grain quality, hybrid rice and high nutrient use efficient varieties. These four traits accounted for about 54% of their wishes. Rice was the most important crop among the selected farmers followed by maize, but the hectarage of maize was the highest followed by rice; probably this was because of larger spacing for maize.Labour cost was identified as a factor limiting production, especially for irrigated rice and thus they preferred upland rice which is easy to produce. They identified land preparation, inputs, planting, weeding and harvesting as the most expensive activities. The majority of the respondents (66%) grew irrigated rice, while 25% grew upland rice. This disparity was attributed to the fact that upland rice was new, the varieties having been officially released in 2009. This is in contrast to the irrigated varieties that they have been growing since 1951 when the irrigation scheme was established as a pilot scheme. Most farmers wanted to grow upland rice but lack of seeds, appropriate varieties and production knowledge was a major setback. The existing varieties were viewed as high input-based and unaffordable.</p>

					<p>XiaoBai Shen. <i>Innogen Working Paper</i> No. 52. 2007.Technically, China is in the lead in developing transgenic rice and is poised to be the first in the world to make transgenic rice available in the market. However, over the past four years, no approval has yet been given by the Chinese regulatory authority to any successfully trialled traits, because of intractable social, economic and political problems affecting its applications. Applying analytical perspectives from science and technology studies (STS), this paper examines the socio-technical specificity of rice technology in China. As an agricultural technology, rice technology has an extremely close relationship with both the social setting and the natural environment. Rice technology is not singular, rather a sociotechnical ensemble. To China, rice was once the pivotal feature of the society and considered the key characterising element of the economy.The paper looks into the historical development of the socio-technical system of rice technology in the particular context of China, and discusses the revolutionary changes involved in the adoption of hybridisation as a rice breeding technology. It argues that in China the subsequent application of genetic modification and related technologies in rice variety development can be seen as an extension of traditional rice breeding technologies, rather than the radical discontinuity it is frequently portrayed as. Some problems associated with GM organisms also arose with the earlier technology of rice hybridisation. The paper suggests that China’s current regulatory regime, established to align with Western regulatory practices and shaped by a particular history of controversy in the West and may not be suitable for China to deal with her own pressing issues.</p>

					<p>Z. Pan, R. Khir, K. L. Bett-Garber, E.T. Champagne, J.F. Thompson, A. Salim, et al. <i>Transactions of the ASABE </i>54(1): 203-210. 2011.Infrared (IR) radiation heating could provide a high heating rate and rapid moisture removal for rough rice drying. The objective of this research was to investigate the effect of the drying bed thickness on drying characteristics and quality of rough rice subjected to IR heating. Samples of freshly harvested medium grain rice (M202 variety) with 20.5% and 23.8% (w.b.) moisture contents were used for this study. They were dried with two different radiation intensities (4685 and 5348 W m-2) and exposure times of 15, 30, 40, 60, 90, and 120 s for each drying bed thickness. The three tested drying bed thicknesses were single layer, 5 mm, and 10 mm. After IR drying, the samples were tempered for 4 h followed by natural cooling. The drying rate, moisture removal, and temperature of the rice were determined. The rice temperatures after the IR heating were in the range of 35.9°C to 71.4°C. The heating and drying rates decreased with the increase of bed thickness. Up to 2.2% of moisture was removed during natural cooling after tempering, without additional energy input. IR heating under tested conditions did not have adverse effects on rice sensory and milling quality, including total rice yield, head rice yield, and degree of milling of the dried rice. It was concluded that a high heating rate, fast drying, and good rice quality can be achieved by IR heating of rough rice to about 60°C followed by tempering and natural cooling with a tested bed thickness up to 10 mm.</p>

					<p>O.I. Oladele and T. Wakatsuki. <i>Life Science Journal </i>8(2)622-627. 2011.Millions of dollars are spent each year on R&amp;D to improve the livelihood of farmers and other stakeholders in the rice value chain; however, there has been little impact. Major reasons include the limited collective learning that occurs between various stakeholders and the neglect of building a multi-stakeholder innovation system for rice in West Africa. This has made research results less relevant and so they have less positive impact on farmers.This paper describes how Sawah rice production technology has evolved through learning alliances that involves social learning and innovation systems and brings Japanese institutions, research institutes, Ministry of Agriculture, extension agencies, farmers groups, Millennium Village, marketers, and universities in Nigeria and Ghana together on a platform with clear objectives, shared responsibilities, cost and benefits, using research outputs to refine future technological approaches, differentiated learning mechanisms, long term and trust-based relationships. The process is increasingly leading to increased learning and effectiveness in rural entrepreneurial development and improved livelihoods. The paper gives a description of the scenarios based on experience in the sawah rice technology development and concludes with its application in other parts of West African region.</p>

Karikari et al. <i>African Journal of Agricultural Research </i>6(19): 4455-4466. 2011.A two-year emergency rice (Oryza sativa L.) initiative was launched in 2009 in response to the global rice crises in 2008. The objective of this initiative in Ghana was to increase rice productivity in order to improve food security. Project activities included planning sessions, demonstrations, training courses and community seed production. The project made remarkable progress in enhancing access to quality seed and fertilizer for over 12,600 farmers while expanding knowledge of best-bet production technologies. Farmers produced 28,663 Mt of paddy which was 16,841 Mt above what they normally produced without project intervention. Average yield increased by 92% and also 4,093 women farmers constituting about 32.4% of the total number of participating farmers benefited directly from the project. Seed fairs, rural radios and audio-visual broadcasts on improved rice production technologies were used to reach non-participating farmers. The combination of methods that stimulated adoption of improved rice production technology was effective in achieving both increased paddy yields and household income. Investment in rice technology transfer and production efforts during the two-year period was well justified.</p>

					<p>M. Hassanullah, Md. Abdus Salam, S.Ahmed, N. P. Magor. From: <i>Innovations in Rural Extension Case Studies from Bangladesh</i> edited by P. van Mele, A. Salahuddin and N.P. Magor, CABI Publishing, Wallingford, UK. 2005.APEX, a national NGO, formed a coalition with Mark Industries Ltd., the Bangladesh Rice Exporters Association and poor farmers to plan and implement a sub-project on &quot;Technological Development of Production, Processing and Marketing System of Aromatic Rice in North-West Region of Bangladesh&quot;. APEX established a national inventory of indigenous and modern varieties of aromatic paddy. Through on-farm trials, farmers identified the three best-performing high-yielding aromatic varieties viz. BRRI dhan 34 and 37, and Basmati. APEX formed and trained 67 groups, totalling 330 resource-poor farmers, who may be called upon by any exporter or miller. A contractual marketing system ensured timely supply of desired aromatic rice varieties to millers, exporters, local and overseas consumers. Buy-back guarantee of paddy reduced transaction costs for farmers and middlemen.Farmers also received at least an 18% premium on top of the normal market price, increasing their income by on average Tk 4,100 per acre (US$ 170 per ha). The project helped to increase milling recovery from 52% to 63%, after which two mills also agreed to improve their packaging technology. To strengthen the value chain, an Aromatic Rice Export Clearinghouse (AREC) was established to help farmers, millers, and exporters with advice, logistics, arbitration, market intelligence and market promotion. </p>

					<p>In Bangladesh, where rice accounts for almost 70% of consumers’ caloric intake, the share of the less expensive coarse rice is shown to be rapidly decreasing in rice markets and the quality premium for the fine rice has been consistently on the rise in the last decades. It thus seems that the role of rice as only a cheap staple food is being redefined. The increasing demand for the more expensive varieties is seemingly associated with a more important off-farm food sector – in particular, milling, retailing, and branding – as well as a transformed milling industry. Research further found that the labour rewards for growing different rice varieties are not significantly different and that farmers do not benefit directly from consumers’ increased willingness to pay for rice.

					<p>Rice is Madagascar’s main staple crop and ‘Dista’ rice, which is cultivated in the Toamasina province near Lake Alaotra (in the northern central plateau of Madagascar), is named after the farmer who discovered it.The rice, a pale pink color, smells like cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg, is very nutritious and yields are double that of other varieties.

	Dista rice also shatters less when milled, helping reduce post harvest losses and increasing farmers’ income.Dista yields are also high for another reason: farmers are using the “Système de Riziculture Intensive” to cultivate it (see <a href="http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/index.html" target="_blank">http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/index.html</a> for “System of Rice Intensification”, SRI). SRI practices include transplanting seedlings when they are very young and growing them widely apart, adding compost from organic matter to the soil, weeding regularly, and using a minimum amount of water instead of flooding fields. This helps create deep root systems that are better able to resist drought, while also increasing yields, strengthening the plant, and enhancing its flavour.

IDS, Sally Brooks, 2010.

Considerable attention and resources are being directed towards the biofortification of rice - the world's most important food crop. These approaches, the book argues, exemplify a model of global, 'public goods' science that is emerging within complex, international research networks. It provides vital lessons for those researching and making decisions about science and research policy, showing that if this model becomes entrenched, it is likely to channel resources towards the search for 'silver bullet' solutions at the expense of more incremental approaches that respond to locality, diversity and the complex and uncertain interactions between people and their environments. The book presents a series of key changes to institutions and practices that might allow more context-responsive alternatives to emerge.</p>

					<p>
Scientists breed a new strain of flood-tolerant rice. About half the world's population eats rice as a staple. If rice crops suffer, it can mean starvation for millions. Normal rice dies after three days of complete flooding. But scientists using &quot;precision breeding&quot; have developed a new variety of rice that can survive being submerged for 17 days, potentially saving crops in flood-prone areas -- and millions of people from going hungry.

					<p> Rice-based farming systems in Cambodia incorporate rainfed lowland rice, dry season rice in some cases, animal production (cattle, pigs, chickens and ducks), fishing (or fish culture) and other activities such as palm sugar production, vegetable production, wild food collection and trade. Because of the close interaction of these components, a change in any one of them can alter the whole system. The adoption of a modern rice variety (IR 66) in the early wet season of the rainfed lowland rice agro-ecosystem resulted from the interplay of many factors which provided the preconditions that favoured adoption of the new technology. Agricultural innovation was associated simultaneously with adoption (of a product of professional research) and adaptation (by farmers to fit local circumstances) so that emerging opportunities for change could be exploited. The key to this innovation process was experimentation by farmers using novel inputs. Innovation was thus a collaborative process involving sequential learning and social change.

					<p> The importance of rice self-sufficiency in farming system evolution was studied, using data of household surveys conducted in 5 out of 6 districts of the Province of Bac Kan in northern Vietnam in 1999 and 2000. Statistical analysis was used to reveal the relationship between upland rice, crop-livestock interaction, and off-farm activities. It was found that the production strategies of the different households depended on their access to rice fields (mountains, valleys, and terraces) and on their level of self-sufficiency. When households lack lowland rice, they turn to the hillsides to grow upland rice, to raise cattle and pigs, and for off-farm activities to sustain their livelihoods. In contrast, households that are able to meet their lowland rice requirements diversify into cash crops and buffalo breeding. A classification of farming systems is suggested. The study was part of a wider effort to ensure that development interventions and appropriate technical and economic advice is targeted to the right type of farmers. From authors' summary.</p>

					<p> Low external-input (LEI) agricultural technologies are commonly developed for and promoted in poor rural areas of the developing world because they are presumably more appropriate for farmers who may not have the access or ability to adopt methods requiring significant purchased inputs. The System of Rice Intensification (SRI), a LEI technology, has received a fair amount of attention in recent years both in and outside of Madagascar, where remarkable yield increases have been achieved in a country where most farmers are unable to grow enough rice to feed their families. Despite its promise, SRI is difficult for most farmers to practise because the method requires significant additional labour input at a time of the year when liquidity is low and labour effort is already high. While SRI may be unique for its dramatic yield increases and relative complexity, the highly seasonal, labour-intensive nature of SRI is common to many LEI technologies, calling into question the common assumption of the appropriateness of such technologies for smallholders.
