They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>M. LaverdièrePaper Submitted to XII World Forestry Congress, 2003 Quebec City, Canada2003<a href="http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/ARTICLE/WFC/XII/0181-A1.HTM" target="_blank">This paper</a> looks at the status and contribution of Indigenous Fruit Trees (IFTs) to food security in southern Africa, and reviews and assesses the physical situation of IFTs in the Miombo Woodland. It contains information on use and trade of IFTs, and on biological developments in domestication and dissemination. It covers processing and marketing and explores avenues for the future of IFTs. Some 40% of the total land area of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) region of 682 million ha is covered by natural forests and woodlands. Ethnobotanical surveys have explored use of and problems related to IFTs. Vegetation mapping is available in all SADC countries and covers dominant species, including IFTs. Some IFTs are also recorded during this process and correlations can be made to estimate fruit production. Priority species for domestication include: <i>Uapaca kirkiana, Parinari curatellifolia</i>, and <i>Strychnos cocculoides</i>. Species in drier areas such as <i>Sclerocarya birrea</i> and <i>Adansonia digitata</i> are also important for domestication. Studies show that many IFTs are easy to propagate by seed and vegetatively. Currently, no documentation exists on which the formulation of sustainable forest management plans for IFT extraction can be based. Research programmes should emphasize this aspect.</p>

The objectives were to: determine IFTS diversity in the traditional farming system; generate a species priority list, characterize and document the values of IFTS as perceived by farmers; and develop criteria for selecting IFTS for on-farm cultivation. A questionnaire designed to capture socio-economic data was administered to 120 randomly selected respondents. Farm walks were conducted to identify and assess the proportion of farmland under IFTS. Preference ranking was used to generate a species priority list. On-farm diversity of IFTS was analyzed using Shannon–Wiener’s diversity index (H'. DAFOR scale was used to rate occurrence of IFTS onfarm. The diversity of IFTS was relatively high (H' = 2.164) although the average proportion of farmland under IFTS cover was low (23.3 ± 5%). <i>Vitellaria paradoxa, Vitex doniana, Anona senegalensis</i> and <i>Tamarindus indica </i>were most preferred by local people. The choice of IFTS for on-farm cultivation varied from their food, medicinal to cash values. There is a need to formulate clear policies and by-laws to encourage on-farm cultivation of IFTS.</p>

					<p>C.A.C. Kadu, M. Imbuga, R. Jamnadass and I.K. Dawson <i>South African Journal of Botany</i> 72: 421–427.2006Indigenous fruit trees are widely used by humans in southern Africa. Little information is however available on regional genetic variation in these species, knowledge essential for their proper use and conservation. Here, this gap is addressed by assessing random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and chloroplast variation in <i>Sclerocarya birrea</i>, a fruit tree that has been important to humans in the region for millennia. A strong overall positive correlation between genetic (RAPD) and geographic distances was observed for 12 populations of <i>S. birrea subsp. caffra</i> sampled from seven countries (standardised Mantel statistic, rM=0.857, Pb0.001), supporting a ‘structuring-by-distance’ model in devising genetic management strategies. Cluster analysis indicated, however, that genetic distances between geographically proximate stands were high on occasions, suggesting that inclusion of multiple stands nationally can sometimes be useful in rangewide management. Overall, an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that 19% of RAPD (assumed nuclear) variation partitioned among <i>S. birrea subsp. caffra </i>stands. Consistent with other nuclear–organellar comparisons for tree species, a much greater proportion of chloroplast variation (70%) partitioned among stands, suggesting a rather limited role for seed compared to pollen in mediating gene flow. Further analysis of <i>S. birrea</i> involved additional sampling from Tanzania of two other recognised subspecies (subsp. <i>birrea</i> and subsp. <i>multifoliolata</i>) that are not otherwise found in the southern Africa region. AMOVA indicated that more RAPD (29%) and chloroplast (75%) variation partitioned among relatively proximate subspecies stands (4 populations, 1 subsp.<i> caffra</i>, 2 subsp. <i>birrea</i> and 1 subsp. <i>multifoliolata</i>) in Tanzania than among subsp. <i>caffra </i>stands sampled extensively across southern Africa, suggesting Tanzania should be a focus for genetic management activities. <a href="http://www.worldagroforestry.org/downloads/publications/PDFs/JA06078.pdf" target="_blank">View publication.</a></p>

					<p>W. Mojeremane and S.O. Tshwenyane<i>Pakistan Journal of Nutrition</i> 3 (5): 264-267. 2004 <i>Azanza garkeana</i> (morojwa) is a valuable edible indigenous fruit tree species confined to east and southern Africa. Because of its multiple uses, the species is selected and retained by farmers in Botswana when they clear the woodland for crops and building house. It is one of the indigenous fruit tree species that is semi-domesticated by local people in Botswana. The species is an important indigenous source of food in Botswana. Besides providing people with fruits, the tree also provides goods (timber, firewood, fodder, etc.) and services (soil conservation, shade, etc.). The species is an important source of essential minerals particularly P, Ca, Mg and Na. <a href="http://www.pjbs.org/pjnonline/fin222.pdf" target="_blank">This paper</a> reviews<i> Azanza garckeana</i> as an important multipurpose indigenous fruit tree with high potential social and economic value in Botswana.</p>

BourkeThe Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.<a href="http://www.icuc-iwmi.org/files/Publications/Bourke - Indigenous fruit in PNG.pdf" target="_blank">This paper </a>describes some of the indigenous fruit species of Papua New Guinea (PNG); that is, species which were grown and eaten prior to settlement by other Pacific islanders, Europeans and Asians from about 1870 AD onwards. A list of 40 species that are eaten as fruit in PNG is presented, but the list is by no means complete. Information is given on ten of the most commonly eaten indigenous fruits grown by the rural population, and six other indigenous fruit species. The following attributes are covered for each species: how the fruit is consumed; global distribution; distribution within PNG; altitudinal range in PNG; the number of rural people who live in locations where the species is common; production pattern (crop seasonality); marketing; and potential for further development. The species discussed are bukabuk (<i>Burckella obovata</i>), coastal pandanus (<i>Pandanus tectorius</i>), golden apple (<i>Spondias cytherea</i>), kumu musong (<i>Ficus copiosa</i>),<i> Ficus dammaropsis</i>, <i>Ficus tinctoria,</i><i>Ficus wassa</i>, Malay apple (<i>Syzygium malaccense</i>), marita (<i>Pandanus conoideus</i>), mon (<i>Dracontomelon dao</i>), parartocarpus (<i>Parartocarpus venenosa</i>), pouteria (<i>Pouteria maclayana</i>), rukam (<i>Flacourtia rukam</i>), ton (<i>Pometia pinnata</i>), watery rose apple (<i>Syzygium aqueum</i>) and traditional mango (<i>Mangifera minor</i>).</p>

					<p> A comparative performance analysis was carried out of 45 orchards containing mango in Phrao at 80 km of Chiang Mai, northern Thailand, with the aim to identify land and management aspects that condition mango productivity. Tree counts revealed that mango trees made up 34, 42, and 23% of the orchards on hills, footslopes, and terraces, respectively. Log-linear relationships that quantify the contribution to the total yield gap for each yield constraint showed that yields increased if: (1) it was not an &quot;off&quot; year; (2) the orchard was situated on a hill or on soils with a relatively high pH or poor water holding capacity; (3) supplemental irrigation could be supplied; (4) weeding was carried out by tractor; (5) pruning was carried out; and (6) if pesticides were sprayed by motor sprayer, deep into the canopy. The model suggests that environmental factors (location and pH) accounted for about 30% of the yield gap, while management factors accounted for 49%, and the year effect for 21%. The log-linear behaviour of the yield data results in exponential yield increments for each partial yield gap closed. Hence, current production is not yet constrained by the law of diminishing returns and management of mango should strive for the highest level of technology available.

					<p>B.N. Ekesa, M.K. Walingo and M.O. Abukutsa-Onyango<i>African Journal of Food Agriculture Nutrition and Development </i>9: 8.2009Unacceptably high rates of micronutrient deficiencies persist mostly among resource-poor communities who rely on subsistence farming. In these communities, consumption of vegetables and fruits is the most sustainable way of reducing micronutrient deficiencies. Apart from enhancing dietary diversity, indigenous vegetables and fruits are often easier to grow, resistant to pests, acceptable to local tastes, rich and cheap sources of micronutrients. Despite this, they are mostly associated with poverty. <a href="http://www.ajfand.net/Issue29/PDFs/Ekesa3750.pdf" target="_blank">This paper</a> gives results on accessibility to and consumption of indigenous vegetables and fruits by rural households obtained from a cross-sectional surveys carried out in Matungu division, western Kenya. Accessibility was measured by; availability at local markets, own production and obtaining from natural habitats while consumption was measured using a food frequency questionnaire. Two local markets were purposively selected and 120 households drawn from the population. Data was collected using market surveys and questionnaires and summarized using tables and charts. Of the 372 market stalls only 23.5% and 13.8% of them had indigenous vegetables (9 varieties) and fruits (4 varieties) respectively. Indigenous vegetables were only cultivated by 11.8% of the households; these included only six varieties and cowpea leaves (<i>Vigna unguilata</i>) were the most popular. Five indigenous fruit varieties were being gathered, and guavas were the most popular. Consumption of up to 9 varieties of indigenous vegetables was observed, with cow peas, jute mallow and amaranths reporting more than 50% consumption. Six varieties of indigenous fruits had been consumed. The low accessibility to and consumption of indigenous vegetables and fruits observed, pose a major nutrition problem. Caregivers, mothers and small-holder farmers should be educated on the role of indigenous vegetables and fruits in food security, nutrition and health. They should also be encouraged and supported to sustainably grow and utilize these fruits and vegetables.</p>

	This project promotes high quality food, fiber, and healthcare crops grown in diverse agroforestry systems to provide family farms both subsistence and commercial opportunities. Specialty crops provide a rapidly growing economic opportunity for farmers and gardeners who are interested in diversifying their crops and who are willing to innovate their production methods, post-harvest processing, and marketing. Farm and Forest Production and Marketing (FFPM) profiles for 32 crops detail essential information for crop development: horticulture and botany; the roles for each crop in mixed-species agroforestry; nutrition and food security; commercial products, product quality standards; location and size of markets; post-harvest processing; opportunities for local value-added processing; and the potential for genetic improvement.The project supports:


integrating trees and crops (agroforestry)

commercial and non-commercial plantings of all sizes, including homegardens

small-scale commercial operations suitable for small lots

local food production for happier and healthier communities

traditional crops

community food self-reliance.


Project outcomes include increased adoption of specialty crops, micro-enterprise development, local food production, and sustainable multi-crop agroforestry systems, thereby supporting economic and ecological viability of our communities.</p>

	The African Centre for Crop Improvement (ACCI) is based on the Pietermaritzburg campus of the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. In January 2004 the University of Natal merged with the University of Durban-Westville to form the University of KwaZulu-Natal. The new university (with a combined student population of 42 000 students in 2004) is now the largest in South Africa. The University of KwaZulu-Natal is a multi-racial, multi-cultural, English medium university with increasing numbers of international students. The Faculty of Science and Agriculture, within which the ACCI is located, has eleven agricultural disciplines plus a full complement of biological and physical sciences.The ACCI aims to train African plant breeders in Eastern and Southern Africa, on African crops, to breed better crops using conventional and molecular breeding tools. The focus is on the breeding of African and African grown Crops (cereals, roots and tubers and pulses) for increased drought tolerance and improved food security for the poor in Africa.</p>

					<p>Chemical pesticides have toxic effects on several non-target species and issues of safety and evaluation of toxicity in the environment is raised on a regular basis in civil society. <a href="http://www.intechopen.com/books/pesticides-advances-in-chemical-and-botanical-pesticides" target="_blank">This book</a> is a compilation of paper looking into the effects of chemical pesticides on fish, earthworms, and beneficial microbes in agricultural ecosystems. Of note are the following chapters: Biotechnological approaches for insect pests control, Plant based pesticides, biomarkers and pesticide exposure in fish. This publisher has produced <a href="http://www.intechopen.com/books/pesticides-strategies-for-pesticides-analysis" target="_blank">another book</a> on strategies and techniques for pesticides analysis.(Intech Publisher, 07/2012)<a href="http://www.intechopen.com/books/pesticides-strategies-for-pesticides-analysis" target="_self">http://www.intechopen.com/books/pesticides-advances-in-chemical-and-botanical-pesticides</a><a href="http://www.intechopen.com/books/pesticides-strategies-for-pesticides-analysis" target="_self">http://www.intechopen.com/books/pesticides-strategies-for-pesticides-analysis</a></p>

					<p>The CGIAR Roots, Tubers and Bananas research programme recently released its first publications: two training manuals, one on growing bananas using tissue-culture plantlets and the other on running a banana tissue-culture nursery. The manuals are based on trainings conducted in Burundi, Kenya and Uganda as part of a project exploring alternative ways of delivering tissue-culture plantlets to smallholder farmers. To encourage farmers to switch to tissue-culture plantlets, development projects typically distribute large quantities of plantlets at subsidized prices. The problem with this type of strategy is that the supply chain set up during the project usually collapses when donor support ends. The training manuals are not intended for farmers or nursery operators, but are meant to be used by extension workers or applied scientists to take the concerned parties through the technical aspects of taking care of tissue-culture plantlet.&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.promusa.org/tiki-view_blog_post.php?postId=233" target="_blank">ProMusa.org</a>, 1/03/2013)&nbsp;</p>

					<p>This manual describes the best practices in all aspects of commercial pineapple production and post-harvest handling, utilising materials, technologies and support services that are generally available to the Caribbean farmer. The manual incorporates the principles of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) for the production and delivery of pineapple to consumers as a safe, wholesome commodity. This manual is a revision and reprint of the 2008 publication, ‘A Guide for Sustainable Production of Export Grade Pineapple in Dominica’. It provides up-to-date information on appropriate marketing strategies, the required crop management, yields and productivity programmes and post-harvest practices.<a href="http://www.cardi.org/blog/caribbean-pineapple-production-and-post-harvest-manual" target="_self">http://www.cardi.org/blog/caribbean-pineapple-production-and-post-harvest-manual</a>(CARDI and FAO, 2011)</p>

					<p>Tropical fruits are adapted to hot and humid environments. Many tropical fruit species might spread beyond their current geographical limit whereas some species might exhibit irregular bearing of fruit. In this context, there are some important questions that need answers: What are the key characteristics that allow farmers to choose a new crop that they are not used to growing? Are farmers already experiencing impacts of climate change? If so, what are their adaptation strategies? Are there new opportunities for capitalizing tropical fruit tree genetic resources that benefit human kind? The study provides a state of knowledge to overcome threats to agriculture and food security, exploring new ways of helping vulnerable rural communities adjust to global changes in climate.<a href="http://www.bioversityinternational.org/index.php?id=19&amp;user_bioversitypublications_pi1%5bshowUid%5d=6946" target="_self">http://www.bioversityinternational.org/index.php?id=19&amp;user_bioversitypublications_pi1[showUid]=6946</a>(Bioversity, 2012)</p>

					<p>This volume about fruits is the third in a series about lost crops of Africa. The volume describes 24 little-known indigenous African cultivated and wild fruits that have potential as food- and cash-crops but are typically overlooked by scientists, policymakers, and the world at large. Fruits described vary from baobab and butterfruit to chocolate berries and custard apples. The book assesses the potential of each fruit to help overcome malnutrition, boost food security, foster rural development, and create sustainable landcare in Africa. Each fruit is also described in a separate chapter, based on information provided and assessed by experts throughout the world. Volume I describes African grains and Volume II African vegetables. <a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11879" target="_blank">Read this document</a>.</p>
