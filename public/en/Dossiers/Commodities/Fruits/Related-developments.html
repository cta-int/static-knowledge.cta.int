They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	The genome of the cucumber has been sequenced by an international consortium lead by Chinese and U.S. institutions. The annotated genome was published online November 1st by the journal <i>Nature Genetics</i>. The cucumber genome will give insight into the genetics of the whole cucurbit family, which includes pumpkins and squash, melon and watermelon, and be a platform for research in plant biology, said William Lucas, professor and chair of the Department of Plant Biology at the University of California, Davis. Lucas helped with the development and management of the project. &quot;This is going to help a large community -- we can now go ten times faster than we could before,&quot; Lucas said. Lucas studies the vascular transport systems, phloem and xylem, that plants use to move nutrients, minerals and signalling molecules throughout the body of the plant. Pumpkins and cucumber are model plants for studying vascular transport, because their vascular system is large and easy to access. (Source: Daily Science, 3 November 2009)</p>

	This research activity is part of the 'Mood Indigo Caribbean - Dyeing for the Blues' project that is being conducted by Dr Sonia Peter, head of the Department of Chemistry, at the Barbados Community College in collaboration with the Barbados Fashion Alliance and funded by the UNDP. Selected plant species will be investigated for natural dye sources. The dyes will be subjected to a variety of analytical methods for chemical profiling and efficacy. As Indigo was once of economic significance to the island during the colonial period, the project aims to revive the interest in indigo within the local fashion industry. In addition, extracts from other indigenous plant species used in traditional medicine will be subjected to analytical investigation including chromatography and spectroscopy for suitability as sources. Novel agents will be explored for the indigo fermentation process and as aggregator for the dyeing process. All fabrics will be of natural fibres with a focus on Sea Island Cotton, which is known to be of high quality. Toxicity testing of the natural dyes developed is also planned. This is in an effort to green the sector of the local fashion industry that is involved in textile manufacture.

	Researchers at Kenya University Botanic Garden are trying to re-establish jute mallow and similar vegetables as staples in the African diet. Jute mallow is a nutritious leafy vegetable with a long history and a variety of names (originating from Egypt, it is also called ‘Egyptian spinach’). The leaves are very nutritious, rich in iron, protein, calcium, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, and dietary fiber. When cooked, the leaves exude a slimy jelly which many liken to the texture of okra, prompting the name ‘Bush okra’. The vegetable has almost as many varieties as it does names (more than 15 in total). 
The most widely cultivated species is <i>Corchorus olitorius</i>, but all of the varieties are all edible and widely cultivated. The jute mallow is harvestable three to four weeks after planting, can be re-harvested three or four times a season, and doesn’t require artificial fertilizer. Farmers can harvest six to ten tons per hectare and jute mallow can be planted in rotation with other crops, resulting in healthier plants that are more resistant to damage by pests. Unfortunately, despite these benefits, jute mallow has largely gone ignored by researchers, leading to a lack of quality seed, as well as indigenous knowledge about cultivation practices.(Source: Worldwatch Institute blog, 12 Mar. 2011) </p>

					<p><i><b>Global honey bee colony disorder and other threats to insect pollinators</b></i><b>By UNEP Division of Early Warning Assessment, 2010.</b><a href="http://www.unep.org/dewa/Portals/67/pdf/Global_Bee_Colony_Disorder_and_Threats_insect_pollinators.pdf" target="_blank">This bulletin</a> published by UNEP considers the latest scientific findings and analyses possible answers to the threats faced by insect pollinators. It asks the question: Has a ‘pollinator crisis’ really been occurring during recent decades, or are these concerns just another sign of global biodiversity decline? As the bee group is the most important pollinator worldwide, this bulletin focuses on the instability of wild and managed bee populations, the driving forces, potential mitigating measures and recommendations. Currently available global data and knowledge on the decline of pollinators are not sufficiently conclusive to demonstrate that there is a worldwide pollinator and related crop production crisis. Data indicate that global agriculture has become increasingly pollinator dependant over the last 50 years and pollination is not just a free service but one that requires investment and stewardship to protect and sustain it.</p>

Farmers in Jamaica have started to grow turmeric on test plots around the country with the help of the ministry of agriculture's export division. The plant grows wild in Jamaica, especially in western parishes, but this is the first time a concerted effort has been made to cultivate it for the US$ 133 million export market. Tests show that Jamaican turmeric contains at least 4 % curcumin, the chemical that gives the spice its yellow colour (the market-leading Indian turmeric is at 5 %). Turmeric is mainly used for colouring and mixed with other spices to make curry powder. Curcuma is a powerful antioxidant.

					<p>Avocado, a significant fruit crop grown in many tropical and subtropical parts of the world, is threatened by Phytophthora root rot (PRR), a disease that has already eliminated commercial avocado production in many areas in Latin America and crippled production in Australia and South Africa. Research on developing PRR-tolerant rootstocks to manage the disease has been a major focus of avocado research at the University of California, Riverside. Now, a research team has released three rootstocks, available for commercial propagation by nurseries, showing superior tolerance to PRR. The research, to appear in the journal <i>HortScience</i>, describes the three avocado root-rot-tolerant varieties: Zentmyer, Steddom, and Uzi.(<a href="http://phys.org/news/2012-04-avocado-rootstocks-high-performing-disease-tolerant.html" target="_blank">Physorg</a>, 27/04/2012)</p>

					<p>IPS reports on an effort by nonprofits and NGOs aimed at introducing the Samoan breadfruit variety to the Caribbean. Breadfruit, a staple in the Pacific Islands for thousands of years, has been popular in the Caribbean for over 200 years. What’s different about the trees being introduced this time around is that they are a Samoan variety called Ma’afala, previously unknown in this part of the world. Ma’afala was selected as optimal for mass propagation and distribution because it has the highest protein and mineral nutrition (iron, potassium, zinc) of 94 varieties studied, and is widely considered one of the tastiest of varieties. All the Ma’afala grown and distributed in the Caribbean today originates from the collection at the Breadfruit Institute, part of the Hawaii-based National Tropical Botanical Garden.

An article explaining how Africanised bees enabled the revival of Trinidad and Tobago’s honey production. Africanised bees which many feared would have destroyed the country's beekeeping industry (because they colonized the island and overtook the European bees’ habitat) have instead helped put Trinidad and Tobago on the map as having the best honey in the world. Trinidad’s honey is regarded as being of very high quality, having won the top prize in two international competitions. Early 2001, the industry lost its impetus when new European Union regulations stipulated that honey must be tested in laboratories before it enters the European market. Numerous petitions were made to set up laboratories so that Trinidad and Tobago could again sell its prized honey in international markets. Presently the demand for honey is greater than the supply, and the local industry churns out an estimated three tonnes of honey every season. But to stimulate honey production so that the growing demands for honey are met, the Trinidad and Tobago Beekeepers Association have asked the ministry of Food Production, Land and Marine Affairs for access to forested areas to set up apiaries.(Source: Trinidad Express, 27 October 2010.)</p>

The workshop marked the culmination of a long-term research initiative by the Natural Resources Institute (NRI), University of Greenwich, UK and collaborators that develops and promotes the use of new safe effective biological pesticides in West Africa. Pest control in Africa has so far depended upon the use of synthetic chemical pesticides.

FAO has launched a quick reference calendar covering 43 major African countries that advises which crops to plant when, according to the type of agricultural zone from drylands to highlands. The web-based tool, developed by FAO experts, covers more than 130 crops from beans to beetroot to wheat to watermelon. It is aimed at all donors, agencies, government extension workers and non-governmental organizations working with farmers on the continent. There are 283 agro-ecological zones covered in the calendar, representing the vast richness and variety of the African ecology as well as challenges of land degradation, sand encroachment and floods.(Source : FAO, 11 November 2010)</p>

	“<b>Plantwise</b>” is a collaborative project, led by the Centre for Agricultural Bioscience International (CABI, UK), that will combine self-sustaining networks of free, community-based ‘plant clinics’ with a central Plantwise Knowledge Bank, creating a global vigilance system that will help prepare farmers to fight the pests and diseases that can ravage their crops.The project received funding from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) to support the training of plant doctors and establishing hundreds of clinics in 40 countries over the next five years: the programme is to deliver a wide range of agricultural advice and services, and strengthen local and regional plant health networks.
 The plant clinics will follow the model already established by CABI in fifteen countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The clinics advise farmers on all aspects of plant health in the way a doctor does for humans. They are run by local technical people, known as plant doctors, who set up the clinics in rural marketplaces or other places where farmers congregate. Farmers drop by with samples of their plants to get the problem identified and to learn what to do about it. Studies of clinics in Bangladesh and Bolivia have shown that, as a result of the clinics, farmers have increased crop yields and spent less money on inappropriate or excessive use of pesticides, increasing their average household income and improving livelihoods. The plant clinics will operate in conjunction with the Plantwise Knowledge Bank, a prototype of which is due to launch in mid- 2011. (Source: CABI, April 2011)</p>

The Project aims to collect the wild relatives of 26 key crops, conserve them in genebanks, and prepare them for use in plant breeding programmes in time to breed new crop varieties adapted to new climates.<a href="http://www.cwrdiversity.org/" target="_self">http://www.cwrdiversity.org/</a></p>

					<p>Apple thinning has been a major problem for farmers seeking to transition from conventional to organic production. Consumers expect organic apples to have comparable size and quality to non-organic fruit, and thinning is needed to achieve that goal. Organic farmers are not able to use most plant hormones and instead rely on time-consuming and expensive hand labour to thin their trees. In Europe, organic farmers also use mechanical methods, as well as lime-sulphur and molasses. These other methods are not as effective as hand thinning and can damage trees. Now, scientists at the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) have found a way to thin trees using an ingredient commonly found in kitchens.By applying potassium bicarbonate, a substance used in baking, to trees at a key times in the growing season, organic farmers can efficiently regulate crop load better than hand thinning and the other alternatives currently used in organic production. The results were consistent for 11 varieties treated over a three year period. Potassium bicarbonate has the advantage of being very environmentally friendly. In 2012, Swiss authorities approved the commercial product, Armicarb©, for use as an apple thinner based on FiBL’s research.(Excerpt from <a href="http://www.fibl.org/nc/en/service-en/news-archive/news/article/apple-thinning-with-potassium-bicarbonate.html" target="_blank">FiBL News Service</a>, 20/8/2012)</p>

					<p>The new online GIS platform aims to provide agricultural related spatial datasets in a user friendly platform and offers data for six commodity value chains: Mango, Citrus, Maize, Rice, Soybean and Cashew. The platform also provides agricultural commodity prices, crop production, agricultural imports and exports figures and Ghana's agricultural budget and in this way the platform pulls together factual data, statistical data and interactive maps. While most data are free, there is a fee for premium datasets.&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://aims.fao.org/community/open-access/blogs/ghana-launches-arcgis-online-platform-agriculture" target="_blank">FAO AIMS</a> and <a href="http://www.ghanabusinessnews.com/2013/04/04/online-platform-to-provide-data-on-ghanas-agric-sector-launched/" target="_blank">Ghana Business News</a>, 4/04/2013)&nbsp;</p>

					<p>At the 246th National Meeting &amp; Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS), speakers described how natural colours used centuries ago are making a &nbsp;resurgence in response to consumer preferences, manufacturers' needs and the promise that these antioxidant-rich substances may have health benefits. The &nbsp;natural colours industry for foods and beverages is gaining in value and one major change is the appearance of root crops like black carrots and purple sweet &nbsp;potatoes, which are grown specifically for the this growing industry. These undervalued and underutilised (until now) crops have become primary agricultural products, &nbsp;compared to fruits such as grapes, which are grown for other purposes and used as secondary colours. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-09/acs-psp082113.php" target="_self">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-09/acs-psp082113.php</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(EurekAlert, 08/09/2013) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
