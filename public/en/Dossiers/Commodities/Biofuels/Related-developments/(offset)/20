						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>
By IFPRI, 2008. Biofuel demand is increasing because of a combination of growing energy needs; rising oil costs; the pursuit of clean, renewable sources of energy; and the desire to boost farm incomes in developed countries. In turn, the need for crops—such as maize and sugarcane—to be used as feedstocks for biofuels has increased dramatically. That demand has had a significant and increasing impact on global food systems.</p>

	A ‘miracle’ plant, once thought to be the answer to producing renewable biofuels on a vast scale, is driving thousands of farmers in the developing world into food poverty, a damning report concludes today. Five years ago <i>jatropha</i> was hailed by investors and scientists as a breakthrough in the battle to find a biofuel alternative to fossil fuels that would not further impoverish developing countries by diverting resources away from food production. <i>Jatropha</i> was said to be resistant to drought and pests and able to grow on land that was unsuitable for food production. But researchers have found that it has increased poverty in countries such as India and Tanzania. (Source: the Independent, 15 February 2010)</p>

	Recent advances in genomics research and plant biotechnology provide opportunities to facilitate the development of new sorghum cultivars and hybrids for high productivity of biomass with desirable cellulose. Yinghua Huang of the United States Department of Agriculture: Agricultural Research Service says that cellulosic biomass is becoming an attractive energy feedstock as the supplies are more abundant, and sorghum, in particular shows great potential due to its &quot;high water-use efficiency, high biomass productivity under sustainable low-input conditions, and amenable to manipulation of its cell-well characteristics.&quot; (Source: CBU, December 11, 2009) </p>

	Seaweed holds promise as more than an ingredient in a purifying face mask or a maki roll. So say researchers at E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., which alongside the Bio Architecture Lab (BAL) has secured $9 million from the U.S. Department of Energy to explore seaweed's potential as a feedstock for biobutanol, an advanced biofuel. Their venture appears to have largely cornered the current market. Though more than 200 companies have looked into algae-based biofuels, DuPont and BAL say most others have shied away from using macroalgae, like kelp.

	A consortium including the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) and St. Louis, Mo.-based Orion Genomics have sequenced and assembled three oil palm genomes in an ongoing project to find ways to increase yield, protect against disease, and strengthen plants against environmental stress. The three oil palm genomes came from two oil palm species: <i>E. oleifera</i>, which is native to South America, and <i>E. guineensis</i>, which originates in Africa. <i>E. guineensis</i> is more widely planted in Malaysia because of its high productivity, but <i>E. oleifera</i> offers increased resistance to disease and oil with higher quantities of unsaturated fats. The group says its work provides a comprehensive genetic blueprint that could blend the benefits of the two species of the plant, increasing yields and productivity for the growing food and biodiesel markets.

					<p>Media educators from ten journalism and mass communication institutions in the Eastern Africa region took part in a training workshop in November 2009 to help them better report on biotechnology and biofuels using radio as a case study. The training workshop was organized by ISAAA AfriCenter in collaboration with the School of Journalism and Mass Communications of the University of Nairobi with financial support from UNESCO. The training originated from the realization that building capacity of media educators on advanced radio interviewing skills and exposure to basic concepts on the subject would have a multiplier effect from training a larger pool of journalists. This would enhance regional capacity with potential to institutionalize specialized writing on biotechnology in journalism training curriculum. Mr. Hezekiel Dlamini, the UNESCO advisor for communication and information in East Africa, challenged the media and the scientists to find a common language of interaction in promoting factual, balanced and unbiased reporting of biotechnology. The Director of Extension and Training in Kenya's Ministry of Agriculture Mary Kamau emphasized the importance of mass media in creating awareness on biotechnology which she observed is very low in the region.

					<p>The promise of biofuels like ethanol is that they will someday help the world grow its way out of its addiction to oil. The reasoning is that if we use greener biofuels in place of gasoline, it will significantly enhance our effort to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. But the question is, are biofuels really green? A pair of new studies in the October 22 issue of Science damningly demonstrate that the answer is no, at least not the way we currently create and use them. In the first study, a team of researchers led by Jerry Melillo of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Massachusets (USA) projected the effects of a major biofuel expansion over the coming century and found that it could end up increasing global greenhouse-gas emissions instead of reducing them. In the second paper, another team of researchers of Princeton University uncovered a potentially damaging flaw in the way carbon emissions from bioenergy are calculated under the Kyoto Protocol and in the carbon cap-and-trade bill currently being debated in the US Congress. Melillo's paper points out that if biofuels scale up rapidly, they could end up displacing cropland and pasture, which would impact global food supplies and increase land-based carbon emissions. Melillo found that if biofuels were linked to a global policy to stabilize carbon concentrations in the atmosphere at 550 parts per million — a modest goal — we would need more land for biofuel production by the end of the 21st century than is currently used for all food crops. Worse, all the fertilizer needed to grow those bioenergy crops would increase emissions of nitrous oxide, an extremely potent greenhouse gas, and water supplies would also be stressed. Melillo calls for a complete analysis of the unintended consequences of biofuels. (Source: African Agriculture, 23 October 2009)</p>

					<p>The General Secretariat of the OAS is a partner organization of the US-Brazil Bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Biofuels Cooperation and is working to help implement partnership activities in the third-party countries that are beneficiaries to the MOU, including Jamaica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Guatemala, Honduras, and St Kitts and Nevis. It also supports other projects with universities and private sector groups. These project activities are aligned with the objectives described in the declaration issued by the 37th OAS General Assembly, most commonly known as the Declaration of Panama: Energy for Sustainable Development. The OAS recently issued a request for proposals for the implementation of the project <i>Technical Assistance for Biofuels Development and Policy Support in Jamaica</i>. The project aims to support the development and implementation of Jamaica’s biofuels policy and programs, establish a strong legal and regulatory framework for a vibrant liquid biofuels industry, facilitate the sharing of perspectives among the respective stakeholders, and advise on appropriate technologies.

					<p>There may still be significant questions over issues such as land use and competition for feedstock supplies for traditional food and feed uses, but that will not stop the global use of biofuels from more than doubling between 2009 and 2015. That is the verdict of a new global analysis released by Hart Energy Publishing’s Global Biofuels Centre which concludes that the US will see a growth of total biofuel use by more than 35 per cent; while Brazil will increase domestic supplies by 30 per cent and more than double the production of palm oil biodiesel. Major contributors to the growth of biofuels are expected to include Indonesia, France, China, Thailand, India, Columbia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Argentina; while Germany is expected to remain the largest producer of biofuels in Europe. The prediction suggests that first generation ethanol, palm oil biodiesel and rapeseed biodiesel will be the dominant biofuels produced and, out of approximately 170 next-generation biofuel projects around the world, only 30 per cent are expected to be operating during the study timeframe.

					<p>Cash-strapped Caribbean countries are seeking energy independence through bioenergy development but are hamstrung by poor organization and limited initiatives. UNDP sources said recent biofuel advances in the Small Island Developing States promised a greater reliance on regional resources - &quot;south-south cooperation&quot; - to cut dependence on imported fuel and food. But the targets for self-sufficiency were far from being reached because of lack of expertise, cash resources and access to new technologies, reports on recent studies and surveys indicated. Caribbean states are looking to build capacity for biofuels produced from organic waste. Technologies now exist to convert plants, garden waste and manure into charcoal, biodiesel, ethanol or gaseous fuels but are not yet available to the Caribbean states. The region is also looking more actively into wind, solar, geothermal and hydropower power. The overarching aim is to build cooperation between the countries of the region so they can make use of sustainable energy services and enhance their energy security.

					<p>The promise of green gold is fading from <i>Jatropha curcas</i>, a shrub that thrives in arid conditions and whose seeds yield a diesel-like oil. Many had seen it as a potential saviour for marginal lands, a plant that could lift developing countries out of poverty and into a sustainable oily future. Just last year, some analysts predicted that the area planted with jatropha worldwide — at the time, 721,000 hectares — would rise as high as 22 million hectares by 2014. But, out of 140 investments made in biofuels so far this year, says an analyst of London-based New Energy Finance, only four or five have been in jatropha projects. Early investors are now realizing the plant's limitations. Jatropha can live in very dry conditions, but does not necessarily yield a lot of seeds. The plant takes three years or more to reach maturity, requiring care along the way, and jatropha seedlings are often not well-suited to the climate in which they are planted. Although jatropha may not be a saviour plant, it is likely to find its niche as a local alternative in certain developing countries. (Source: Nature, 16 September 2009)</p>

					<p>The African nations of Rwanda and Mozambique are moving forward with plans to boost biodiesel production. Landlocked Rwanda considers biofuel production from locally grown feedstocks an important part of national security. Since 2007, Rwanda’s Institute of Scientific and Technological Research has experimented with a number of feedstocks including palm, jatropha, moringa, castor and soy oils, in a 2,000 liter per day (approximately 160,000 gallons per year) pilot facility at the capital city Kigali. Mozambique is also developing a biofuels industry with the hope of contributing 15 percent of the national fuel consumption in the next five years. In the Ecomoz Project, the Mozambique state-owned fuel company, Petromoc and several other partners have produced about 1 million liters of biodiesel, primarily from coconut oil, at a pilot facility near the capital city of Maputo.

	Salt-loving algae could be the key to the successful development of biofuels as well as being an efficient means of recycling atmospheric carbon dioxide. The current major limitation of biofuel production is the lack of adequate feedstocks, soybeans and corn, for biodiesel and ethanol production, respectively. Halophytic (salt-loving) micro-algae can be grown on marginal lands with brackish or salt water unsuitable for traditional agriculture. Their growth is non-seasonal, making them 10-30 times more productive than terrestrial crops. They can be grown on municipal wastewater and have widespread potential for recycling carbon dioxide from biomass-, coal-, and gas-fired power plants.

					<p>Angola will begin planting sugar cane for the first time in more than 30 years as the oil-rich country takes its first step toward biofuels. A 30,000 hectare (74,000-acre) site in Malanje province, east of Luanda, is the first biofuel project to get off the ground in Angola where the government is trying to revive farming after decades of war. The scheme is also part of efforts to diversify the economy away from its dependence on oil and diamonds, which have powered a post-war boom since Angola's civil conflict ended in 2002. The leftover fibrous remains from the cane, along with the leaves and waste heat from the sugar processing will be used to produce electricity – around 217 megawatts a year – which will be used locally. Angola is the latest in a line of African countries giving over land to companies for non-food crops, a trend that raises concerns for rural communities at the level of the United Nations.

					<p>Africa is central to the worldwide growth in biofuels, with Dutch, American, Swedish, Japanese, German, and British firms all competing for farmland to grow the next generation of energy producing crops. Ghana has made itself a focal point of biofuel growth in Africa. As host of this year's World Jatropha Summit, the government in Accra is seeking greater investment in the hardy plant whose seeds can be crushed into oil that is processed into high-quality biodiesel. In Ghana, seven private companies are currently farming about 50,000 hectares of land for biofuels. The non-governmental organization Food Security Policy Advocacy Network studied the impact of multinational jatropha production in the Volta, Eastern, Central, and Ashanti regions. The survey, conducted with ActionAid Ghana, revealed that there were serious threats to livelihood and food security. With hundreds of farmers not planting traditional food crops this season, there is a real risk that the shift to biofuels will result in food shortages. (Source: VOA news, 23 August 2009)</p>

					<p>Ghana’s only oil refinery, the Tema Oil Refinery (TOR) intends to go into the production of biofuels in the next 18 months, in anticipation of the phasing out of conventional oil, its acting Managing Director has said. Dr Kwame Ampofo then stressed on the importance for African refiners to shift their focus from conventional fuels to biofuels so that they will be in a better position to satisfy the international market. Currently, in Ghana over twenty companies say they are investing in biofuels, some are into the cultivation of Jatropha. (Source: CheckBiotech, 6 July 2009)</p>

					<p>Cuba, with the support of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, known in Latin America with the acronym COSUDE, is investing in a research program named &quot;Bio-Mass as a Renewable Source of Energy for the countryside&quot;. Bio-mass is the main renewable energy source in Cuba. The main goal of the project is to boost the production of biogas, a fuel obtained from the decomposition of organic matter when there is lack of oxygen in the air. José Sotolongo MSc, founder of the Application of Technologies for a Sustainable Development Center, said that they plan to obtain this bio fuel by processing the waste from coffee beans, rice and forestry residues. Besides this center, the partners of the project include the Indio Hatuey Experimental Station, from Matanzas University, the Sugar Cane Research Institute, and the Science and Technology's Agency's Priority Projects Group that belongs to the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment.
