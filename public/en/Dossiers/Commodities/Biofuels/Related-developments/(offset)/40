						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>A report published by the UNESCO hosted World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP) has warned that the sharp increase in biofuel production has significant impact on water demand. According to the <a href="http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/wwdr/wwdr3/pdf/WWDR3_Water_in_a_Changing_World.pdf" target="_blank">United Nations World Water Development Report 3</a> , presented ahead of the Fifth World Water Forum in Istanbul, production of ethanol stood at 77 billion litres in 2008 and should reach 127 billion litres by 2017. One of the major problems with biofuels is the need for large quantities of water and fertilizers to grow the crops. Between 1 000 and 4 000 litres of water are needed to produce a single litre of biofuel. The report says that, despite their potential to help reduce dependence on fossil energy, biofuels, with current technology, are likely to place a disproportionate amount of pressure on biodiversity and the environment.

					<p>With biofuel production on the rise, researchers are looking for ways to grow plants for use as energy sources without taking over fertile land currently used for food crops. One possible solution is to move biofuel feedstocks onto poor quality soil that is not ideal for agriculture, such as soils that lack nutrients, receive little rain or have been contaminated from previous industrial use. Scientist have found a unique way to increase the growth of one promising biofuel source on marginal land: just add bacteria. If the conversion problems are solved, cellulosic biofuels could not only become crucial energy sources, they could also provide a way to put otherwise unproductive land to good use.

	Biologists at Kansas State University are working with a researcher in Ghana to create biodiesel from the seeds of trees that are common and well adapted to the climate of northern Ghana. Walter Kpikpi from the University for Development Studies, Navrongo Campus, in Ghana visited K-State in November 2008 with funding from K-State's African Studies Center. He is leading a project that will make biodiesel for local farmers in Ghana from seeds collected by local farmers. Proposing that Jatropha curcas and Azadirachta indica seeds are best suited for biofuels, Kpikpi's project envisions cultivating these trees specifically for biodiesel production on land that isn't suitable to grow food.

					<p>Ghanaian small scale farmers, particularly women, are facing displacement from their farm lands. In recent times, the northern parts of Ghana are said to be witnessing an influx of foreign companies engaged in jatropha and sugar-cane plantation for biofuel production. Some of these companies that are investing in biofuel production acquire large track of land but only pay the farmers for the portion of the land they utilize, in spite of an existing contract.

					<p>A new scramble for arable land in Tanzania has started - the coastline and the fertile land in Northern and Southern Tanzania being the prime targets. This scramble, which has seen thousands of acres of fertile arable land falling into the hands of foreign companies, has been engineered by the quest for bio fuels. At least for now five regions have been at the centre of this scramble. Dar es Salaam, Coast, Tanga, Mbeya and Arusha regions have been cited as the first victims of land grabbing engineered by foreign companies in Tanzania.

					<p>By FAO, 2008. The impact of biofuels on food prices remains the subject of considerable debate, as does their potential to contribute to energy security, climate-change mitigation and agricultural development. The report finds that while biofuels will offset only a modest share of fossil energy use over the next decade, they will have much bigger impacts on agriculture and food security. The emergence of biofuels as a new and significant source of demand for some agricultural commodities – including maize, sugar, oilseeds and palm oil – contributes to higher prices for agricultural commodities in general, and for the resources used to produce them. For the majority of poor households who consume more food than they produce, higher prices can pose a serious threat to food security – especially in the short term.</p>

					<p>It is now becoming clear that green fuels like ethanol and biodiesel have played virtually no role in the recent global surge in food prices. The spectacular trends in agricultural commodity markets prove it. Biofuels output rose only very gradually over the course of the past two years, whereas prices for feedstocks jumped and then crashed. Today, the same amount of biofuels is being produced, world wide, than before the food price crash, and people are not eating less.

					<p>A leading World Bank economist’s claims that biofuels are a major cause of soaring world food prices could further undermine support for the alternative fuel worldwide and cause tensions with the White House, which fervently supports the new industry. The draft report, by the Bank’s top agricultural economist, Don Mitchell, estimates that the growing use of food for fuel, combined with low grain stocks, market speculation and export food bans, contributed as much as 75% of the 140% rise in prices between January 2002 and February 2008. The remainder of the increase is due to a weakening US dollar, higher energy prices and related increases in fertilizer costs, he said. ‘Increased biofuel production has increased the demand for food crops and been the major cause of the increase in food prices,’ said Mitchell, who is widely respected for his work on agricultural policies and production. Mitchell’s preliminary finding of 75% has sparked a heated debate because it goes beyond most other estimates. So far, estimates have ranged between 2–3%, by the Bush administration, and up to 30% by the FAO. There is growing concern the US ethanol industry is a big part of food inflation, with the sector on tap to buy up to one-third of the U.S. corn crop -- a grain normally used for food and livestock feed (Source: Reuters, July 9, 2008). </p>

					<p>The Kenyan courts are considering halting the first stage of a US$370 million biofuel project that aims to replace up to 20,000 hectares of coastal grassland with irrigated fields of sugarcane. The project is intended to generate electricity — up to 34 megawatts a day at its peak — from sugar refining and up to 20 million litres of ethanol fuel annually from molasses. Proponents of the project say it will reduce fuel prices, lower foreign exchange losses from importing 200,000 tonnes of sugar annually, create 20,000 jobs and put biofuel-powered cars on Kenyan roads. But conservationists such as Paul Matiku of Nature Kenya say the lack of project design documents — required by Kenyan environmental law — has been a critical omission in the assessment process (Source: Ochieng’ Ogodo and Christina Scott, SciDev, 5 August 2008).</p>

					<p>In a clearing on Kenya's coastal grasslands, a group of nomadic herders shout down government officials who have flown in from Nairobi to explain the benefits of a proposed $350 million sugar project. Hoping to plug Kenya's annual 200,000-tonne sugar deficit and make biofuel, the government, together with the nation's largest miller Mumias, plans to plant cane on 20,000 hectares of the vast Tana River Delta on the Indian Ocean coast. The plan has aroused enormous controversy in east Africa's largest economy, pitting ancient traditions against development, environment against industry, and traditional nomads against large-scale farming (Source: by Duncan Miriri, Reuters, 20 Jul 2008).</p>
