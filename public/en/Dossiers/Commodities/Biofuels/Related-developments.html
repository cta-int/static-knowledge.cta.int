They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Japanese researchers at the National Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences and National Agricultural Research Organization have successfully developed an efficient on-site ethanol production system with non-sterilized whole rice crop round bales. The solid-state fermentation system produces biofuel and animal feed at the same time without any off-site processing. The technology involves wrapping rice plants grown to feed livestock along with yeast, enzymes and bacteria into a bale covered with a plastic film, and capturing the ethanol produced by the resulting fermentation. &nbsp;(<i>Biotechnology for Biofuels</i>, 30/01/2015) &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.scidev.net/global/biofuels/news/farm-system-rice-plants-biofuel-fodder.html" target="_self">Read</a> also SciDev’s commentary.</p>

					<p>CIRAD is now investigating how special types of sugarcane could be used to generate electricity on a large scale. This type of cane, called ‘fuel cane’ and ‘keeps mills turning’, could also become a major source of electricity in future in countries such as Réunion, Guadeloupe and Martinique. It corresponds to high-biomass varieties that produce much more biomass than traditional varieties grown for their sugar. This could foretell a new ‘fibre cane’ supply chain, alongside the traditional cane-sugar-rum chain. &nbsp; &nbsp;(CIRAD, 27/01/2015)</p>

Their key findings indicated that, if the biofuel market proves lucrative, there is possible diversion of labour and land to bio-fuel projects and that competition of input use might lead to reduction of food production and high food prices. However the price of bio-fuel feedstock from jatropha in Zambia was not attractive enough to encourage farmers to grow more jatropha which has raised major concerns by policy makers. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.academicjournals.org/journal/AJAR/article-abstract/A05DC3E42807" target="_self">http://www.academicjournals.org/journal/AJAR/article-abstract/A05DC3E42807</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>African Journal of Agricultural Research</i>, 18/12/2014)</p>

					<p>In Brazil, Petrobras requires farmers to devote no more than 20% of their arable land to the no-edible crops. This ‘mixed food and feed-stock’ policy helps to guarantee that the farmers maintain a steady food supply, regardless of what happens in the biofuels market.

	An article in<i> Global Change Biology Bioenergy</i> reviews the suitability of Agave (<i>Agave americana</i>) as a bioenergy feedstock that can sustain high productivity in spite of poor soil and stressful climatic conditions accompanying climate change. Agave, which grows successfully under hot, dry conditions, is currently used in the production of beverages, food, and fiber, and has only recently been considered a promising source of biofuel.E. Garcia-Moya, Professor of Botany at the Colegio de Postgraduados en Ciencias Agricolas in Texcoco, Mexico, and colleagues were able to assess Agave’s potential as a biomass crop by reviewing Agave research published in English and Spanish. Agave has comparable productivity to high productivity crops such as corn and Eucalyptus and much larger biomass yields than most desert plants. Unlike most crops, Agave would continue to thrive under increased temperatures and variable precipitation accompanying global climate change. In addition, elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 would increase productivity.(Source: AlphaGalileo, 17 February 2011)</p>

	An article in <i>Global Change Biology Bioenergy</i> assessed the net greenhouse gas savings of bioethanol from sugarcane as compared to the use of fossil fuels. Researchers have long promoted biofuels produced from crop biomass as an environmentally sustainable source of renewable energy but rarely questioned whether the potential climate benefit of sugarcane ethanol is diminished when emissions from land use management are considered. Scientists examined the sugarcane ethanol production systems to identify sources of greenhouse gas emissions. They found that land use change, fertilization, residue burning, and tillage had the largest impact on greenhouse gas emissions. In order to maximize greenhouse gas savings, Dr. Cardoso Lisboa and coauthors suggest changes at all stages of the sugarcane production. For example, simultaneous provision of irrigation water and fertilizer would allow the reduction of fertilizer rates in sugarcane production systems. Furthermore, the conversion from pre-harvest burning to no- or minimum-tillage systems with mechanized harvest may better maintain or even increase soil C and N stocks.(Source: Alphagalileo, 2 Mar. 2011)</p>

	This report, produced by Friends of the Earth Europe, says that the amount of land being taken in Africa to meet Europe’s increasing demand for biofuels is underestimated and out of control. The research, which looked at 11 African countries, found at least five million hectares of land – an area the size of Denmark – is being acquired by foreign companies to produce biofuels mainly for the European market. The practice – known as land grabbing – is increasing and is dominated by European companies. However with official public information largely absent, current figures are likely to be only a snapshot and gross underestimates. <a href="http://www.foeeurope.org/agrofuels/FoEE_Africa_up_for_grabs_2010.pdf" target="_blank">View PDF</a> (Source: Zunia, 31 August 2010)</p>

					<p>By Perrihan Al-Riffai (IFPRI), Betina Dimaranan (IFPRI), David Laborde (IFPRI), March 2010. Global demand for biofuels has risen sharply over the last decade, driven initially by oil price hikes and the need for greater energy security. Support measures were established in many countries in recognition of the potential of biofuel development in reducing dependence on fossil fuels, increasing farm revenues, and generating less environmental damage through lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to non-renewable fuel sources. Over the last three years, however, scepticism about the positive impact of biofuels has escalated as the trade-offs between food, feed, and fuels and their impact on global agricultural markets became more evident, eventually leading to the debate over the extent of the role of biofuels in the 2007-08 food price crisis. </p>

					<p>A number of influential studies including a 2009 United Nations study, argue that liquid fuels derived from plants have the potential to shift energy production to much cleaner products and practices, but that to date the environmental benefits have not yet surpassed the risks. That tilt may soon be righted by researchers at the University of Virginia and the Seawater Foundation, who discovered that the most important source of the risk-benefit imbalance was the heavy reliance on fresh water and the need for petroleum-based fertilizer to improve plant productivity. Researchers at both organizations substituted wastewater rich in organic material and developed much cleaner and efficient practices for biofuels development.

					<p>Uganda scientists have made a breakthrough in extracting bio-ethanol from non-food parts of plants - cassava stems, cassava leaves, pineapple leaves, elephant grass stems and wood - opening the way for commercial production of ethanol from new source materials. The announcement follows more than a year of research into the potential of non-food parts of plants and cellulosic materials in producing bio-ethanol. Cellulosic ethanol is difficult and expensive to break down into simple sugars required for ethanol production, but is eventually cheaper say the researchers who argue that the initial investment for biofuels is much lower than for fossil fuels.

					<p>Angola's parliament has approved a law meant to support biofuel production, as the government tries to diversify the economy which currently depends on oil, national radio said Thursday. The law sets out rules for producing biofuels and regulates the role of foreigners in the industry. (Source: AFP, 25 March 2010)</p>

	By International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), 2009. These guidelines aim to highlight the risks of biological invasion by species introduced for biofuels production and to provide constructive recommendations on how to prevent the introduction, establishment and spread of invasive species resulting from biofuel developments. The guidelines are intended to inform policies and practices of biofuel producers and decision makers, and ultimately provide guidance to importing companies and countries.</p>
