						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p> An overview of banana production, post-harvest technology, transportation and marketing in China is presented. In recent year, economic reforms have facilitated a rapid and extensive development of banana production. In 1995, 2.897 million t were produced from 150 800 ha, mostly in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Hainan and Yunnan. Plantations up to 2000 ha exist, but most production is small-scale on areas of 0.3 to 5 ha. There is insufficient refrigerated transport to meet demand. A system of maturity indices and post-harvest treatments was developed for both refrigerated and unrefrigerated conditions. The post-harvest treatment involves washing in chlorinated water, treatment with fungicidal solutions, such as TBA, Sportak, or Rovral, drying, and the use of ethylene absorbent in sealed polyethylene bags packed in fibreboard cartons. During summer with ambient temperatures of about 28-30°C, unrefrigerated banana can be stored well for 25-40 days. In winter with average temperatures of about 10-15°C, the bananas can be stored for 60-90 days, the green colour and firmness of the fruits being well preserved. <i>In Bananas and food security International symposium, Douala, Cameroon, 10-14 November 1998; 2000, p. 601-606</i>  <i>I</i><i>n  Agrociencia (Mexico), 2002, v. 36(2) p. 169-180</i> </p>

					<p> The economic aspects of the banana in Brazil, from production to sale, are examined. Brazil is a considerable banana producer but almost all its banana production is for domestic consumption. This is caused by the following factors: (1) the size of the domestic market; (2) low quality requirement of the local market; (3) high production costs; and (4) high prices in the domestic market. In recent years, Brazil has exported less than 1% of its banana production. The importing countries are Argentina and Uruguay. The north-eastern region of the country is the biggest producer followed by the south-east, north, south and centre-west. The banana production and marketing structures in south and south-east Brazil are better organized and use better technology than in the north-east. Brazilians eat more banana than any other fruit: in 1995, per capita consumption was 35 kg/person/year. Cultivar preferences vary from one part of the country to the other: Prata (AAB) in North-East Brazil; Belo Horizonte, Vitoria, Rio de Janeiro and Florianopolis; and Nanica (AAA) in the southern and south-eastern regions.

					<p> Keeping quality of Karpuravalli banana packed in 400 gauge LDPE (low-density polyethylene) bag with or without ventilation was studied under different storage conditions, namely, ambient temperature, zero energy cool chamber and 13.5°C. Shelf-life of the fruits was highest at 13.5°C and minimum under ambient conditions in both vented and unvented polybags. Non-significant variation was observed for total soluble solids of fruits under all 3 storage conditions. The acidity increased gradually up to the end of green life and then either decreased (in unvented polybags) or remained unchanged (in ventilated polybags and unpacked control) till the end of yellow life. Reducing sugars and total sugars increased gradually throughout the storage period and was highest in the control fruits and in fruits packed in ventilated polybags. Spoilage was maximum in unvented polybags under ambient and zero energy cool chamber conditions. Storing of Karpuravalli banana fruits in unvented polybags at low temperature could extend the shelf-life of the fruits up to 19.33 days.

					<p> In April 2002, the African Centre for Banana and Plantain Research (CARBAP) established a monitoring centre to identify the main constraints in plantain production in Cameroon, help prioritize future research, and improve profitability for small-scale farmers. A set of 18 plots was selected to represent the agro-ecological and socio-economic diversity of the region. In each plot, a regular survey of 50 banana plants, of the production conditions, and of the agronomic practices was carried out. A principal components analysis was used to identify different types of farms. Differences in entomological, nematological, and soil variation could be partly explained by the various agronomic practices adopted. It was possible to confirm that the black weevil is an important constraint in the area. From authors' summary. <i>In Fruits (France), v. 60(4) p. 237-244</i> </p>

					<p> Starch from banana ( <i>Musa paradisiaca cv. Macho</i>) was modified by acetylation and an alcoholic-alkaline treatment to evaluate its chemical composition and some of its properties for food preparation. The granular cold-water soluble (GCWS) starches prepared with 40 and 60% of ethanol at 25°C had the lowest solubility in cold water, suggesting that temperature has an important role in the modification process. Modified starches had a smaller tendency to retrogradation, measured as a percentage of transmittance. Water absorption capacity (swelling) and solubility increased with the modification. Also, the stability to the freeze-thaw process improved with these treatments. Conversely, starch from acetylated maize showed a poorer stability to the freeze-thaw process compared with non-modified samples. The apparent viscosity of the modified starches was larger than that of the native starches. It was concluded that modified banana starches could be used as additives in frozen desserts and as thickeners in soups.

					<p> How governments regulate food safety and environmental protection, including pesticide residue levels, has important implications for trade. A study was conducted to explore food safety standards and determine whether regulations on pesticide residues in food have an effect on trade flows. Regulatory data from 11 importing OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries and trade data from 21 exporting countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America were used. The results suggest that a 1% increase in regulatory stringency (tighter restrictions on the pesticide chlorpyrifos) leads to a decrease in banana imports by 1.63%. This represents a significant impact on trade with particular relevance to developing countries that rely on exports of agricultural commodities such as bananas. In addition, the findings suggest that lack of consensus on international standards and divergent national regulations on pesticides are costly.

					<p> The status, constraints and perspectives of banana production in Oman are discussed. Subjects include planting, spacing, sucker and weed management, irrigation, fertilization, harvesting, insect pests, diseases and nematodes, post-harvest handling, transport, storage and ripening. In 1997, banana ranked third after dates and lime occupying 2462 ha and producing about 35 000 t/year. The main banana growing areas are the Batinah coast of Northern Oman, comprising Suwaiq, Saham, Shinaas and Sohar, and the Salalah plains of southern Oman. Banana is generally grown in sandy loam soils with either traditional or drip irrigation. Most of the cultivars belong to the cavendish subgroup. The local cultivars Malindi, Fard, Barshi and Naggal are described. Marketing of banana is highly developed and regulated through Public Authority for Marketing of Agricultural Products (PAMAP). The major constraints are the lack of suitable varieties, increasing salinity of irrigation water, and the local prevalence of diseases, such as Sigatoka disease, cigar-end rot, moko disease and burrowing nematode.

					<p> Between 1992 and 2002, the potential of a livelihood approach to agrobiodiversity conservation was examined in the &quot;varzea&quot; floodplains along the Amazon River in Brazil, as part of a worldwide project on People, Land Management and Environmental Change (PLEC). The &quot;varzea&quot; covers a total area of 180 000 km2. The project worked in 234 riparian communities with about 55 000 farmers. The main activities were: (1) identifying, understanding, and evaluating local production and conservation patterns; (2) identifying expert farmers and facilitating demonstrations; and (3) monitoring agrobiodiversity changes. The following techniques were demonstrated and modified: the banana &quot;emcapoeirada&quot; agroforestry system for the control of moko disease; building up soils above the tide level for the production of crops such as cassava; improved fallows with fruit and timber production; and, managing forests for the production of fruits, timber, and medicines. As a result, farmers are making smaller and fewer fields and managing their fallows and forests more for the production of a variety of products. By converting their landholdings into agroforestry plots and managed forest areas, farmers are increasing habitats for wildlife, fish, shrimp, and other organisms. <i>In Agrodiversity: learning from farmers across the world., 2003, p. 43-78</i> </p>

					<p> That the banana industry of the Windward Islands is in crisis is beyond dispute. The context in which that crisis has emerged and ways it might be overcome are examined. The industry has been caught up in the changes produced by the process of globalization, i.e. the international integration of markets. Adjusting to this new economic environment will be as difficult and painful as it is necessary. Successfully adapting to the requisites of the globalized economy could represent an important step toward economic development. The following subjects are dealt with: (1) the background and structure of the banana industry in the Windward Islands; (2) the content of the banana marketing regime that was introduced in Europe in 1993; (3) the responses of multinational corporations to that marketing system; (4) the rulings by the World Trade Organization (WTO) that invalidated the European system of importing bananas; and (5) the response by the Windward Islands' banana industry to those rulings and the future of the industry. <i>In Journal of Eastern Caribbean Studies (Barbados), 2000, v. 25(4) p. 1-25</i> </p>

					<p> The banana-based home gardens (kibanja) of the Haya people of Tanzania constitute one of the few examples of banana-based home garden systems in the world. In 1997, 7 months of field work was carried out among 150 households (33 of which were female-headed) in the mainly Roman Catholic village of Busingo, Muleba District, Kagera Region to analyse the process of agricultural changes in a densely-settled Haya village since the country's independence in 1961. The estimated population density was 318.4 persons per square km. The current status of Haya farming and land use patterns are described, followed by the major socio-economic impacts affecting agricultural activities. Finally, the uniqueness in the Haya agrarian changes are discussed in the socio-cultural context. It is concluded that the contemporary reactions of the Haya farmers to dynamic changes reflect their historic appreciation of the micro-environment: kibanja is to be sustained as their socio-cultural core, with the open grassland used for cattle grazing (iweya) acting as a buffer space to absorb internal and external impacts. <i>In African Study Monographs (Japan), 2002, v. 23(4) p. 147-175</i> </p>

					<p> Baseline data on bananas and plantains in West and Central Africa were collected with the aim of making recommendations for improving data collection. Information is mostly limited to the 4 main producing countries, which together account for 60% of the regional production: Cameroon, Ghana, the Ivory Coast and Nigeria. Information covers the cultivation of plantains, production, consumption and marketing. The main constraints to the development of the plantain commodity chain are: (1) lack of suitable hardy plant material; (2) pests and diseases; (3) soil fertility and availability of water; (4) competition with cash crops; and (5) marketing constraints; and (6) research constraints. The secondary data on bananas and plantains are incomplete for most countries. This is due either to insufficient use being made of the existing data sources as a result of their scattered distribution and difficulties of access, or else to their complete unavailability. Priority areas for data collection in Cameroon, Gabon, Ghana, the Ivory Coast and Nigeria are suggested. <i> In INFOMUSA (Netherlands), 2003, v. 12(1) p. 8-13</i> </p>

					<p> Between 1995 and 2002, the potential of a livelihood approach to agrobiodiversity conservation was examined at 2 demonstration sites (parishes of Bushwere and Kamuri) in Mbarara district in southern Uganda, as part of a worldwide project on People, Land Management and Environmental Change (PLEC). Traditional land management, tenure arrangements, and banana cultivation are described and a biodiversity inventory was conducted. Examples of demonstration activities are: (1) the promotion of diversity in banana gardens; (2) crop diversification in home gardens; and (3) the integration of stall-fed livestock. The PLEC activities helped farmers appreciate the abundant natural resources around them, the medicinal species, and the alternative income-generating activities. There was increased community awareness of the importance of agrodiversity and biodiversity conservation, not only for environmental protection, but also for socio-economic reasons. The banana-growing and eating culture in Uganda offers great potential for sustainable agrodiversity, especially agrobiodiversity conservation. <i>In Agrodiversity: learning from farmers across the world, 2003, p. 134-153</i> </p>

					<p> Developments in banana production and world trade during the period 1985-2002 are examined. The volume of bananas exported worldwide in that period grew at an unprecedented average annual rate of 5.3%; twice that of the previous 24 years (2.4% between 1960 and 1984). This expansion was accompanied by technological changes and changes in the world trade scenario including: the opening of socialist economies to world markets in the early 1990s; bilateral and multilateral efforts to liberalize trade; rising environmental awareness; the creation of the Single European Market in 1993; an unprecedented period of economic growth fostered by multimedia technologies and &quot;the new economy&quot; in the developed world; the implementation of structural adjustment policies in banana-producing countries; and a significant concentration of trade at the retail level. An overview of the evolution of production and trade in the last 15 years, and an in-depth description and analysis of the events and causes underlying such developments are provided. Issues reviewed include: banana production and exports in the major exporting regions of the world; the evolution of imports and of import policies of major markets; technology changes at production and transportation levels; environmental and social concerns, policies and instruments; and, the roles of transnational companies in the world banana economy. <i>In FAO Commodity Studies (FAO), 2003, no. 1</i>  <i> <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5102e/y5102e00.htm" target="_blank">Download PDF</a> </i> </p>

					<p> This reference book will be of great use to international researchers engaged in banana genetic improvement for enhanced food security, nutrition, and employment generation. In order to address problems facing banana and plantain cultivation, the Plant Breeding and Genetics Section of the Joint Division FAO/IAEA started a Coordinated Research Project (CRP) entitled &quot;Cellular biology and biotechnology including mutation techniques for creation of new useful banana genotypes&quot; in 1994. The main objective of this CRP was genetic improvement of bananas and plantains in order to make a more stable and profitable crop by innovative approaches and conventional breeding. In particular: to enhance regional and interregional cooperation among scientists in developing and developed countries; to integrate radiation-induced mutations and <i>in vitro</i> culture methods into conventional breeding of bananas; to promote the development of methods for large-scale rapid multiplication of the resulting mutants/segregants; to develop molecular markers for rapid characterization of genotypes, to develop rapid methods for genome ploidy-level manipulation, <i>in vitro</i> screening of mutants, validate the use of toxins forearly selection of banana resistant to black Sigatoka disease, transgenics; and to facilitate field-testing in different climatic conditions and regions. FAO/IAEA and INIBAP decided to publish the results obtained during this CRP, together with several review papers, with the aim of providing state of the art information on a number of biotechnological tools for adoption by breeders and molecular biologists to obtain <i>Musa</i> varieties with desirable characters in a more rapid and efficient way. <a href="http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=/docrep/007/ae216e/ae216e04.htm" target="_blank">Download document</a> </p>

					<p> As part of efforts in realising her aim of introducing cooking banana into Nigeria, the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) mounted training and awareness campaigns on its utilisation in collaboration with Shell and Agip Oil companies between 1991 and 1997. This study looked into the adoption profile of the utilisation methods and the factors that may have influenced it. Data were collected from a random sample of 232 respondents from 24 villages in southeast Nigeria. Results showed an overall adoption level of 79.5%. The highest adoption levels were obtained for those utilisation methods similar to local and traditional methods of plantain consumption and lowest for non-traditional uses. The extent or intensity of adoption by the respondents ranged from 1 processing method to 7, with an average of 3. As a proportion of the number of utilisation methods on which training was given, the intensity of adoption ranged from 12.5% to 100% with a mean of 52.2%, meaning that the respondents have adopted more than 50% of the total number methods on which they received training. The major factors which have strongly influenced the adoption process were the level of educational attainment, social status, primary occupation, intensity of training received, availability of commercially-produced plantain products in the market/area, triability as well as the number of desirable attributes of the utilisation methods. <a href="http://www.academicjournals.org/AJB/PDF/Pdf2005/Nov/Lemchi%20et%20al.pdf" target="_blank">Download PDF</a> </p>
