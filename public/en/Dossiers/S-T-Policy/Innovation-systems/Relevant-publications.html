						<dt><a href="../ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation.html">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>By International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) by Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010. Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the poorest regions of the world. Because most Africans work in agriculture, escaping such dire poverty depends on increased agricultural productivity to raise rural incomes, lower food prices, and stimulate growth in other economic sectors. Per capita agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa has fallen, however, for much of the past half-century. Successes in African Agriculture investigates how to reverse this decline. Instead of cataloging failures, as many past studies have done, this book identifies episodes of successful agricultural growth in Africa and identifies processes, practices and policies for accelerated growth in the future. The individual studies follow developments in, among other areas, the farming of maize in East and Southern Africa, cassava across the middle belt of Africa, cotton in West Africa, horticulture in Kenya, and dairying in East Africa.</p>

					<p>By the World Bank and IFPRI, May 2010. The book provides empirical evidence on how different accountability mechanisms for agricultural advisory services and drinking water provision work in practice. Based on surveys among male and female service providers, local policymakers, community-based organizations and household members, the book analyzes the suitability of different governance reform strategies to make service provision more gender responsive. Its recommendations will help researchers, public administration staff, policymakers, and NGO and international development agency staff better design and manage reform efforts, projects, and programs dealing with rural service provision.</p>

					<p>By Center for Global Development, 21 June 2010. The aim of this paper is to stimulate a dialogue on what new approaches might be needed to meet these needs and how innovative funding mechanisms could play a role. In particular, could “pull mechanisms,” where donors stimulate demand for new technologies, be a useful complement to traditional “push mechanisms,” where donors provide funding to increase the supply of research and development (R&amp;D). With a pull mechanism, donors seek to engage the private sector, which is almost entirely absent today in developing country R&amp;D for agriculture, and they pay only when specified outcomes are delivered and adopted. </p>

STEPS Centre 2010. This new manifesto by the STEPS (Social, Technological and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability) Centre lays out new politics of innovation, which recognizes the need for many alternative directions of scientific, technological and associated institutional change. A radical shift is needed in how innovation (new ways of doing things) are perceived, not only for science and technology but for developing new ideas, institutions, practices and social relations that shape scientific and technological patterns, purposes, applications and outcomes. The manifesto provides many links to more detailed examples and analysis on the associated new manifesto (<a href="http://anewmanifesto.org/" target="_blank">http://anewmanifesto.org/</a>). Lessons have been drawn from hundreds of participants in 20 roundtables in countries from China to Venezuela, India to Zimbabwe, Nigeria to Sri Lanka. The manifesto does not assert a single view but together with many parallel initiatives helps to achieve more diverse and equitably distributed forms and outcomes of innovation. Most importantly, it helps to catalyze and provoke more vibrant and explicitly political debate over global patterns and directions of innovation.</p>

By United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 19 May 2010. This report focuses on the challenges of improving agricultural performance in Africa and the role of technology and innovation in raising agricultural production and incomes of all farmers, including smallholder farms. Much of the analysis is to some degree applicable to farmers in developing countries outside Africa. The report argues that the main challenge that lies ahead is one of strengthening the innovation capabilities of African agricultural systems in order to be able to successfully address poverty, improve food security and achieve broader economic growth and development.</p>

	Innovation, Sustainability, Development: A New Manifesto</i> recommends new ways of linking science and innovation to development for a more sustainable, equitable and resilient future.It was produced by the 'Social, Technological and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability' Centre (STEPS), an interdisciplinary global research and policy engagement hub that unites development studies with science and technology studies. While acknowledging that future generations face huge social, environmental and economic challenges, and noting that global governance, economics and people work against the interest of poorer countries and people, the STEPS Centre proposes that science, technology and innovation must play essential roles in meeting the moral and political imperative of addressing the interlinked global challenges. The new manifesto recognizes the need for a new politics of innovation which responds to “which science?”, “what technologies? ‘and “what kinds of change?”. They call for greater respect cultural variety, regional diversity and democratic accountability and opening up of the political space and debate for more deliberation on styles and directions for research and innovation. They propose that radical changes be made to the way in which innovation is shaped through: agenda setting, funding, capacity building, organizational arrangements and monitoring, evaluation and accountability.</p>

This brief focuses on community-based adaptation to climate change, and the means needed to recognize and document local innovation. A number of example from the field help illustrate Prolinnova’s research (<a href="http://www.prolinnova.net/sites/default/files/documents/thematic_pages/climate_change_pid/2009/073237 Summary Prolinnova working paper on Climate Change 080609.pdf" target="_blank">2008</a> – <a href="http://www.prolinnova.net/~prolin/sites/default/files/documents/thematic_pages/climate_change_pid/2009/073237 Prolinnova working paper on Climate Change 100209.pdf" target="_blank">2011</a>) into the innovation and creativity processes appearing in local communities that face uncertainty and hardship due to climate-related environmental change. At a moment in time where food security and climate change are at the top of the agenda, Prolinnova has made three detailed recommendations to help policy makers integrate local innovation in the climate sensitive agricultural programmes they are currently developing: 


Give local innovation due recognition in policy and planning,

Promote farmer led adaptation to climate change, and

Link Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) to local governance and innovation.

The paper commences by reviewing the progress made in the harmonization of seed policies in ECA region with regard to five thematic areas agreed for harmonization namely: (i) facilitation, building and empowering of public-private partnerships; (ii) observation of the importance and differences amongst technical, political and legislative stages in the process of reform; (iii) dialogue at two levels: national and regional; (iv) nurturing transparency, institutional cooperation and multi-disciplinarity; (v) differentiation between administrative/procedural and legislative issues in discussions and consensus building. The results of the welfare analysis give compelling evidence in support of an improved seed policy environment. While improved policy environment requires in contributions from many players and actors, it is assumed that harmonization of policies, laws and regulations is a critical addition to this process.</p>

					<p>New research by the STEPS Centre, the Stockholm Resilience Centre and the Tellus Institute argues that sustainable development goals (SDGs) that keep human societies within a 'safe operating space' requires an approach to innovation that gives far greater recognition and power to grassroots actors and processes, involving them within an inclusive, multi-scale innovation politics. In this jointly-authored paper, current development goals focussing on one-track scientific solutions to global challenges are seen as failing to respond effectively to the uncertainty and shifting dynamics of today's world, and to the diverse needs of the poor. Research and experiences across the world, in areas like agriculture, water, energy and health, illustrate what the paper suggests are a set of underlying principles that need to guide innovation for sustainability and poverty reduction. Three interlinked dimensions need to be assessed together: Direction, Diversity, and Distribution.

					<p>This <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2258e/i2258e00.pdf " target="_blank">FAO publication</a> identifies the underlying drivers that allow small-producer organisations to thrive, the good practices enabling development practitioners and other stakeholders to learn from successful local/regional initiatives, to support them and replicate them. The findings are useful for orienting operational programmes to support and empower small-scale producers in a process of sustainable and inclusive development. Indirectly, policy-makers may also draw inspiration from these cases as they demonstrate that, under the right conditions, critical bottlenecks to food security and sustainable rural development can be overcome. This publication on good practices in institutional building suggests that strengthened knowledge and capacities of individuals are central to fortifying rural institutions. The good practices described herein embody a capacity development approach by addressing all three dimensions in fortifying rural organisations’ members with skills and information (individual dimension), in improving processes and procedures within organisations and linkages between organisations (organisational dimension) and by addressing issues of the enabling environment such as the need to strengthen the voice of rural organisations at the policy level.

It describes a simple model for delivery to farmers that identifies the major types of germplasm sources and discusses how this model can be used to identify relevant interventions to address bottlenecks in current systems. The analysis leads to eight input supply configurations for smallholder agroforestry, typified by three major models. Lessons from the evolution of smallholder crop seed delivery systems can be applied to tree germplasm supply and indicate that a commercial, decentralised model holds most promise for sustainability. However, current emphasis in agroforestry on government and NGO models of delivery hinder the development of this approach. An important implication of this analysis is that current actors in agroforestry input supply systems must redefine their roles in order for effective delivery to take place.</p>

					<p> In 2002, fieldwork was carried out in 8 parishes in Uganda to study the use of indigenous knowledge in producing and consuming traditional vegetables such as &quot;nakati&quot; (Solanum aethiopicum), &quot;ebugga&quot; (Amaranthus dubius), &quot;entula&quot; (Solanum aethiopicum gilo), and &quot;ejobyo&quot; (Cleome gynandra). The proportion of land allocated for traditional vegetables has steadily increased since the 1970s, although exotic vegetables with their premium prices continue to have a greater land allotment. As mineral fertilizers were expensive and manure was still scarce, farmers tried to develop alternative methods to maintain the soil fertility, including fallowing and the incorporation of crop residues. They had found that the residues of traditional vegetables were particularly beneficial and had started rotating traditional vegetables with exotic ones such as common bean and tomato. While farmers did not have any formal networks for sharing knowledge, exchanges between friends, neighbours, and family seem to be effective. (It is extracted from an unpublished report by Hart, T, Abaijuka, I, Kawongolo, J, Rubaihayo, E, Kakonge, E &amp; Mugisha, J (2002) 'The Identification and Recording of Indigenous Knowledge using Rapid Rural Appraisal Techniques: The cultivation and utilisation of Indigenous vegetables in the Mpigi District, Uganda.'

					<p> The overall objectives of the study were to: (1) analyse the current practices and experiences of the Asia and the Pacific Division with regard to scouting, utilising and promoting local knowledge and innovations. The study also documented selected good practices and assessed how the rural people have used local knowledge and innovations to improve their livelihoods and whether this has led to their empowerment; and (2) provide building blocks to ensure greater mainstreaming of local knowledge and innovations into the regional strategy so that all activities in the region will incorporate them. In particular, a series of insights and recommendations was developed that would contribute to improving the design and implementation of IFAD-supported projects and programmes through enhanced use of local innovations, knowledge systems and partnerships. Important attention was devoted to the empowerment of local communities to become more active partners in project design and implementation, and the blending of ‘modern’ technology and local knowledge to capitalise on the best in local and external expertise. <a href="http://www.ifad.org/evaluation/public_html/eksyst/doc/agreement/pi/innovations.htm" target="_blank">Pacific: Promotion of local knowledge and innovations in Asia and the Pacific Region - Thematic Evaluation: Agreement at Completion Point</a> </p>
