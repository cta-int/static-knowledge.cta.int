						<dt><a href="../ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation.html">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>In June 2014, International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) published this brief to stimulate thinking and discussion on ways to design and deliver agricultural finance that supports adaptation to a changing climate for all actors along agro-value chains from producers to exporters. Agricultural finance refers to financial services (savings, transfers, insurance and loans) that are needed by the agricultural sector. This brief primarily targets the banking sector, particularly credit institutions, involved in financing agro-value chains in developing countries, particularly in Africa. The brief builds on the results and recommendations of a six-month pilot initiative on mainstreaming climate risk along the coffee value chain in Uganda, which was conducted in 2013 through a partnership between the Ugandan Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives, Makerere University (MAK) and IISD. &nbsp; &nbsp;(Julie Dekens &amp; Susan Bingi, IISD, June 2014)</p>

					<p>At the April 2014 meeting of the Open Agricultural Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology (OFAB) in Nigeria, agricultural biotechnology experts called on governments to invest in and develop laboratory infrastructures across the continent. Professor Baba Yusuf Abubakar, executive secretary of the Agricultural Research Council of Nigeria and Dr Jonathan Mufandaedza, chief executive and registrar of the National Biotechnology Authority of Zimbabwe explained that modern laboratory infrastructures were indispensable to the promotion of research, enabling testing, certification and innovative development of food products. Dr Nompumelelo Obokoh, chief executive of AfricaBio, said the continent must explore ways of mobilising resources to improve laboratory infrastructure and training scientists in agricultural research, such as public-private partnerships. Other experts argued that obstacles to scaling up research laboratory infrastructures included shortage of trained personnel, poor laboratory management systems, and lack of accessible and quality-assured laboratory services to support meaningful research in agriculture. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.herald.co.zw/invest-in-food-security-african-states-urged/" target="_self"><i>The Herald,</i> Zimbabwe</a>, 02/05/2014) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>The African Higher Education Harmonisation and Tuning event, jointly organised by the European Commission and African Union Commission on 27 March 2014, focused on student mobility, recognition of qualifications and credits, as well as the development of new and joint degree programmes. Over the next seven years, it is envisaged that the new 'Erasmus+' programme will provide grants for 25,000 African students and academics to study or train in Europe, and around 2,750 African researchers will receive support. One of the aims of the meeting was to double the scope of the initiative from 60 African universities and 130 000 undergraduate students to 120 universities by 2015. Overall, it seeks to improve institutional evaluation and to implement a framework for quality assurance and accreditation. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.eu-africa-cc.org/index.php/en/news/106-entrepreneurship-education/466-africa-eu-university-boost-commission-backs-plan-to-double-size-of-partnership-scheme" target="_self">http://www.eu-africa-cc.org/index.php/en/news/106-entrepreneurship-education/466-africa-eu-university-boost-commission-backs-plan-to-double-size-of-partnership-scheme</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(EU-Africa Chamber of Commerce, 25/03/2014)</p>

					<p>Wheat researchers are issuing strong warnings that without increased financial support for stem-rust resistance research, Ug99, new virulent forms of stem rust first found in Uganda in 1999, could continue its movement across Africa and the Middle East and southwest Asia. Scientists have developed new wheat varieties with some resistance to the deadly disease, but the disease evolves and mutates into new forms, requiring new resistant varieties to be developed. While crucially important, the international consortium known as the Borlaug Global Rust Initiative, a US$26 million, five-year effort is believed to fill only half the wheat research gap.

					<p>A new World Bank report says that Africa’s food and beverage markets are projected to reach US$1 trillion by 2030. By way of comparison, the current size of the market is $313 billion, offering the prospect of a three-fold increase. That is, if farmers and agribusinesses can expand their access to more capital, electricity, better technology and irrigated land to grow high-value nutritious foods.&nbsp; The report took an in-depth look at entire value chains for five commodities, rice, maize, cocoa, dairy and green beans. It calls on governments to work side-by-side with agribusinesses, to link farmers with consumers in an increasingly urbanized Africa.<a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/03/04/africa-agribusiness-report" target="_self">http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/03/04/africa-agribusiness-report</a>(World Bank, 4/03/2013)</p>

					<p>A diversity of approaches grounded on participatory action research have been developed including notably the concept of Integrated Agricultural Research for Development (IAR4D). Despite the conceptual agreement around these approaches and the promise they hold, there are also concerns, not only regarding how these approaches can have impact, but also how they can they do so at scale. Participatory approaches to agricultural research have often been judged to be slow and costly 'boutique solutions' confined to the sites where they work directly. As a result their impact on poverty is considered by some to be marginal when compared with commodity research targeting many millions of people.

					<p>Research remains the poor relation of universities south of the Sahara, in particular those in West and Central Africa, University World News reports. This finding was repeatedly and bitterly stated at a forum, ‘Strategies for Sustainable Financing of University Research in West and Central Africa’, held in Dakar, Senegal, from 2-4 July 2012. This state of affairs is in sharp contrast to some countries in East and Southern Africa, which have been able to survive research-wise and benefit from the help of donors, according to the forum. The reason given for the relative success of universities in East and Southern Africa was that their countries had paid attention to research at an early stage in their investment efforts. By contrast, in West and Central African countries and some others on the continent, the share of gross domestic product spent on research is only 0.3%.(<a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=2012072015331199" target="_blank">University World News</a>, 22/7/2012)</p>

					<p>Millions of small farmers are reached commercially every day as they buy seeds and crop protection products, fertiliser, cell phones, machinery and tools, taking advantage of the science and research embodied in these products. The market for agricultural inputs is large, and the role of the private sector as a purveyor of technology and services is growing. It is in the nature of the private sector to bring products to the market and deliver value, including to small farmers. But the private sector goes where there is a commercial incentive. Farmers who are too poor to purchase inputs are not helped, and the technologies they need may not get developed. This is a public policy and societal challenge that cannot be solved by the public or the private sector alone. The solution requires the creative complementarities of public-private cooperation that – in addition to the farm population – must include the ‘third’ or not-for-profit sector (foundations, NGOs, civil society). This pathway can develop and deliver solutions to large numbers of small farmers. (From the proceedings of the Crawford Fund 2009 Conference on world food security.)</p>

					<p>Late February 2012, the European Commission unveiled its plans for two new European Innovation Partnerships (EIPs) that will go some way to meeting the environmental and social issues facing Europe in the near future. The EIP that focuses on agriculture will deal with the increasing challenges food security poses for Europe, where, in this century, there will be a sharp rise in demand for feed, fibre, biomass, and biomaterials. This demand will come at the same time as a slow-down in production, due to cuts in agricultural research and the effects our actions have had on the environment and natural resources. This new partnership will seek to encourage innovations for sustainable food security.

	This briefing identifies the urgent need to strengthen the capacities of policy experts along the CAADP policy processes value chain in order for Africa to take full advantage of this increasing support. The Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) is a pan-African vehicle that translates the vision of the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency (NPCA) into an operational framework to guide agriculture-led development. CAADP’s overall goal is to improve livelihoods, food security and environmental resilience in Africa’s largely agrarian economies. Against this background, the unprecedented rise in international support for CAADP is an indicator of the new focus on global agricultural development, which is also reflected in the increasing relevance of meeting the first UN Millennium Development Goal (‘eradicate extreme poverty and hunger’). The opportunities for greater inclusiveness inherent in CAADP augur well for the African Union–NPCA in the sense that this will result in fairer and greater ownership among stakeholders (including civil society, nongovernmental and farmers’ organisations). Although there has been increasing support for CAADP, strong leadership has been in short supply across the continent, thereby restricting the policy space available to optimise such rising support.

	This study examines the interactions among agricultural mechanization, food production and agricultural development of the Asia-Pacific region. Six countries were chosen for case studies, namely Bangladesh, China, India, Republic of Korea, Thailand and the Philippines, representing different stages of agricultural mechanization. Through visits and talks with policy makers, researchers and the private sector in the six countries, and thorough review of country reports prepared by representatives to the Technical Committee of United Nations Asian and Pacific Centre for Agricultural Engineering and Machinery (UNAPCAEM), the authors have collected extensive data and information on agricultural mechanization, and conducted thorough analysis. The study identifies the main characteristics of agricultural mechanization of each country, and assesses their respective needs in agricultural mechanization. The study also explores the feasibility of establishing an ‘Asia Pacific Network for Testing Agricultural Machinery’ (ANTAM). The feasibility study on the establishment of “ANTAM” is an important part of this report. “ANTAM” is proposed with an aim to promote introduction of uniform testing procedures and safety standards of agricultural machinery, and facilitate intraregional trade.

	The Minister of Higher education and University, Léonard Mashako Mamba laid the first stone at the University of Kinshasa, DRC (UNIKIN) for the construction of an agricultural research center, financed by Korean project KOPIA/DRC.This center has to reinforce the research that contributes to the modernisation and promotion of agriculture in DRC. Once built the research centre will provide farmers with seeds and machinery, to help them improve the quality and quantity of their products. The action also aims at the promotion of scientific research at UNIKIN.The Korean Rural Development Administration set up KOPIA (Korea Project on International Agriculture) centres in countries including Vietnam, Kenya, DRC, Brazil, Uzbekistan and Myanmar to spread Korea's customized agricultural technology. For example, the KOPIA centre in Kenya built and operates vinyl greenhouses, poultry farms and distributed agricultural machines such as bicycle-turned thrashers and rice planting machines in order to help the region's farming activities.(Source: digitalcongo.net, 14 Mar. 2011)</p>

	The Centre for Higher Education Transformation (CHET, South Africa) has published a synthesis report drawing together evidence from eight African case studies that formed part of the Higher Education Research and Advocacy Network in Africa project (HERANA, <a href="http://chet.org.za/programmes/herana/" target="_blank">http://chet.org.za/programmes/herana/</a>). The HERANA research surveyed higher education stakeholders in eight African countries: Botswana, Ghana, Nairobi (Kenya), Mauritius, Eduardo Mondlane (Mozambique), Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), Makerere (Uganda), Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University and the University of Cape Town Both in South Africa).The study revealed that flagship universities in these eight African countries are more similar to institutions elsewhere than is generally perceived, with well-qualified staff, positive student-to-staff ratios, and rising enrolments including in science, engineering and technology.
