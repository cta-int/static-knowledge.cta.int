						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>A new FAO toolkit aims to sharpen the focus of anti-hunger and development efforts by helping countries gather more accurate information on differences between men and women in agriculture. The contribution of women and girls to agricultural production is often under-reported. The <a href="http://www.fao.org/gender/agrigender/en/" target="_blank">Agri-Gender Database</a>, developed in response to a request from the African Commission on Agricultural Statistics (AFCAS), offers step-by-step, example-driven guidance on how to collect gender statistics, or sex-disaggregated data, in agriculture. It is designed for a wide range of users who influence development planning, from agricultural statisticians and researchers to policy planners and gender advocates. (Source: FAO, 15 April 2010)</p>

					<p>
In Kenya, agricultural extension officers offer seasonal and locally relevant climate predictions explained in simple terms in Kikamba, the regional tribal language. They are now producing a handbook to translate weather predictions into practical advice about what and when to plant. The project also helped farmers set up a seed bank. A group of about 40 men will collect, process and preserve the best local seeds and loan them out again during the next planting season, slowly selecting for the best climate-adapted varieties. Now, farmers can circumvent the expensive seed market, where they can't even tell if they are getting the seed varieties they are paying for.(Source: Scientific American, 29 March 2010)</p>

					<p>Nigerian researchers, working with partners in the Netherlands and the United States, are close to developing improved species of cowpeas with traits that could withstand the effect of drought, the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, said. The IITA announced on March 26 that Eugene Agbicodo, the institute’s Lukas Brader postgraduate fellow, has identified portions on the cowpea genome - a set of genetic information where genes that have effects on drought-tolerance and resistance and to bacterial blight, could be located. The effort is a major scientific attempt at finding enhanced species of the protein-rich crop, which faces severe risks as 70% of its cultivation worldwide is done in Africa’s savannah region.

					<p>Farmers in Benin are implementing their own research findings to boost the soil fertility and moisture retention of their plots. The experiment is part of the project Strengthening the Capacity to Adapt to Climate Change in Rural Benin (PARBCC) - established in late 2007 - which aims to create a three-way conversation between farmers, meteorologists and the government, and help farmers make informed choices about when to sow and harvest crops. One of the long-term goals of the programme is to teach the farming community in Benin to mobilise itself to take action against the effects of climate change. Some 300 farmers are enrolled in sixty “field schools” across the country, working with researchers to help Beninese farmers cope with droughts, tropical storms and other hazards related to climate change. The project's aim is to develop, test and implement farming strategies suited to local conditions. These include mulching, planting pits, adopting integrated crop management and using organic fertilisers. (Source: Scidev.net, 13 October 2009)</p>

					<p>Research into an initiative to improve the lot of Ghanaian farmers shows how important it is that farmers organise themselves to improve their bargaining power with buyers. The initiative comes from the local Guinness Ghana Brewery Ltd’s decision to substitute malt with locally produced sorghum. The next step was to contract a number of farmers at Garu in the Upper East Region in northern Ghana to farm and sell sorghum to the company. A team of researchers has investigated the successes and failures of the project. This article is a Q&amp;A between Francis Kokutse and Comfort Kudadjie Freeman, one of the researchers and a lecturer in agriculture extension at the University of Ghana.

					<p>Knowledge sharing is the exchange of ideas and experiences through networks of relationships. Climate change has become a major threat to the African continent with many local communities already affected and struggling to adapt or cope with its impacts. In order to increase the resilience of these vulnerable communities, there is a need to ensure they have access to information on appropriate adaptive practices. However knowledge sharing is relatively limited among climate change actors in Africa. The diversity of stakeholders involved in adaptation processes (from policymakers to CSOs, researchers and, most importantly, local communities) and the barriers imposed by poverty, limited infrastructure, and illiteracy, among others, make knowledge exchange a challenge. Thus, knowledge sharing requires the use of approaches that are tailored to the needs and constraints faced by particular stakeholders. Local communities, for example, may require non-text-based communications such as video or theatre, face-to-face discussions, or local-language radio broadcasts. Similarly, local and indigenous knowledge must be translated into different languages and forms if it is to be appropriately communicated to research and policy communities. <i>The full text with conclusions and recommendations is available at the link.</i> (Source: IISD, 23 July 2009)</p>

					<p>Farmers in Africa are helping to identify alternative farming techniques which will help them adapt to climate change. This participatory research is being conducted as part of the <a href="http://www.idrc.ca/ccaa/" target="_blank">Climate Change Adaptation in Africa programme</a> which is jointly funded by the UK's Department for International Development (DFID) and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC). The study, initiated in 2007, is working with smallholder farmers in Uganda, Tanzania, Ghana, Mali, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe. These countries represent a range of different climatic zones within Africa. As part of the study, learning centres have been established in each country where researchers, extension workers and suppliers of agricultural inputs, such as seeds and fertilizers, work together with farmers to identify which interventions would help to minimise vulnerability to climate change. The learning centres combine the use of local and traditional knowledge with new knowledge to test alternative farming practices such as using different crops and crop varieties, and various methods of improving soil fertility. Declining soil fertility was identified as a major challenge across all study sites, and is a major constraint to the efficient use of available water by crops. (Source: Leisa)</p>

					<p>Scientists of the African Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF), Kenya, the United States Department for Agriculture (USDA) and International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, IITA, Nigeria, have developed a safe and natural method that could drastically cut aflatoxin contamination in African food crops by as much as 99 per cent. Under the biocontrol method, native strains of Aspergillus flavus that do not produce aflatoxins (called atoxigenic strains) can be applied in order to alter the fungal community on crops and throughout an area so that maize becomes less contaminated with aflatoxins. Farmers, policy makers, the food and feed industry and various NGOs have expressed their desire and support to convert this technology into a readily-available product in Nigeria and other countries in Africa.

					<p>A pilot project that uses mobile phones to alert farmers in remote regions to where they can buy drought-tolerant beans has been launched in Kenya - just one of a set of pilot projects using mobile and geospatial technologies to improve communication of important information to farmers across Africa. In the first step of the system researchers confirm where dealers are stocking drought-tolerant beans, mapping their locations. Scientists then use mobile phone services to send the information to government extension workers who have second-generation mobile phones, common in Africa. They can then relay the information to farmers in person or via their phones. &quot;We will produce maps which can be used by extension officers or community development workers so that this information can be passed onto farmers who wish to acquire improved drought-tolerant bean seeds,&quot; says Andrew Farrow, a spatial analyst at Uganda's Kawanda Agricultural Research Institute.

The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) and the Earth Institute at Columbia University in New York today signed a five-year collaborative agreement on the 16th of January, aimed at delivering the best science, technologies and policies to sustainably improve agriculture for Africa’s small-scale farmers, most of whom are women. The two organizations will work together in four countries, with a possible initial focus on Tanzania and Rwanda in East Africa, and Mali and Burkina Faso in West Africa in a collaboration that would provide scientific, technical and policy support to these governments in the design, planning and implementation of effective national programmes to improve agricultural productivity.

					<p>Responding to Commission President José Manuel Barroso's request, the EU executive's ethical advisory body will issue an opinion on modern agricultural technologies by the end of 2008. The European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies examines, at the request of the Commission President or on its own initiative, ethical questions arising from the rapid advances in science and technology. It issues ethical opinions, the aim of which are to provide expertise in connection with the Commission's preparation and implementation of Community legislation or policies. Europe can perhaps afford to make a fuss about food safety and ask for the precautionary principle to be respected as the continent still has enough food to eat but this is not the case for all regions of the world, he added. &quot;Agricultural innovation is ethical,&quot; said Gruissem, underlining that the challenge was rather to ascertain which technologies are needed to improve food standards for all (Source: Euractiv.com, 23 June 2008). </p>

					<p> Mon, 23 May 2005 | This paper provides general information on the New Partnership for Africas Development (Nepad) and the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) in order to facilitate active participation in its processes. It draws on the Nepad policy documents, a range of commentaries and relevant survey data, and summarises key aspects of the Nepad vision and the APRM on the basis that they appear to be insufficiently clear to many individuals, organisations and legislatures potentially affected by them or interested in engaging.</p>
