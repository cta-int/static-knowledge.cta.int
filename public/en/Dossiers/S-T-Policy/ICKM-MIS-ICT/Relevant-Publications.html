						<dt><a href="../ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation.html">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>This sourcebook on livestock data, published by the World Bank, FAO and ILRI, summarises the activities and outputs of the <i>Livestock in Africa: Improving Data for Better Policies </i>project. It provides guidance to decision makers responsible for collecting and analysing livestock data from different perspectives on how to systematically address livestock data-related issues within the context of the national agricultural statistical system. In particular, it first develops the skeleton of a sound livestock statistical system – consistent with the demand of livestock information by stakeholders and the principles of the Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics (World Bank, 2011). It then presents a sample of methods and tools – and associated examples – designed to improve the quantity and quality of livestock data available to decision makers. &nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3706e/i3706e00.htm" target="_self">FAO</a>, 2014) &nbsp;</p>

					<p> Effective information programmes include policies, partnerships, end user involvement, and capacity-building. Information is rapidly becoming a major economic factor but it is underappreciated on the African continent. Development information needs to be delivered in a more convenient, faster, and less expensive fashion and, therefore, the pace of the information revolution in Africa must be enhanced. Factors conducive to effective information programmes include policies, partnerships, end user involvement, and capacity-building. Cost-effective approaches to providing information include co-ordinating agricultural research through regional bodies, use of new technologies such as telecentres and the Internet, sponsorship to provide information sources, charging for information, repackaging information, and considering appropriate information technologies.

					<p> Information management issues related to the systems and services within the National Agricultural Research System (NARS) of India are discussed. The vastness of the Indian NARS and existing agricultural information needs are described. Connectivity issues within the NARS are examined. The Agricultural Research Information System (ARIS) as it exists today under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), along with the current level of information exchange that takes place through the ARIS network, is described. The emerging needs of the Project Information Management System (PIMS) are explored along with the current projects on PIMS and the Integrated National Agricultural Resources Information System (INARIS), a data warehouse project under the National Agricultural Technology Project (NATP). The achievements with respect to PIMS are presented and an action plan for further developments is outlined. The data warehouse tools and action plan for the INARIS project are also elaborated.

					<p> Scientific literature tools based on CD-ROMs fulfil important function in the transitional to broadband Internet access The readiness of agricultural research organizations in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Uganda to access online scientific resources was assessed. The findings indicated that although information and communication technology infrastructure in these institutions is improving, most Internet access is still handled via dial-up connections that are expensive and too slow to download PDF files, or to search online databases. Although connectivity options are rapidly improving, experiences in many developing country institutions confirm that deploying functional and reliable connectivity is a complex undertaking that may take considerable time and effort and that depends on the availability of skilled human resources as well as the implementation of proper institutional policies and procedures. For this reason, scientific literature tools based on CD-ROMs are fulfilling an important function in the transitional phase and should continue to be deployed widely. However, in parallel, online tools like AGORA should be promoted widely, particularly in libraries that have functional broadband Internet access. The AGORA (Access to Global Online Research in Agriculture) programme is an initiative to promote the use of online journals in low-income countries. From author's summary.</p>

					<p>Extension and rural advisory services (RAS) are crucial to putting farmers’ needs at the centre of rural development, ensuring sustainable food security and poverty reduction, and dealing with risks and uncertainty.Knowledge-sharing mechanisms must focus on critical areas including protecting natural resources, productive farming processes, product development, marketing skills, nutritional needs, and household health. There is renewed attention on the importance of advisory services and extension in rural development processes. This paper, based on the publication ‘<i><a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/012/i1444e/i1444e00.htm" target="_self">Mobilizing the potential of rural and agricultural extension</a></i>’ (FAO, 2010) focuses on five opportunities to mobilise the potential of extension and advisory services. The five areas are: (i) focusing on best-fit approaches; (ii) embracing pluralism; (iii) using participatory approaches; (iv) developing capacity; and (v) ensuring long-term institutional support.(<a href="http://www.g-fras.net/en/building" target="_self">GFRAS</a>, 20/6/2012)</p>

					<p> The Internet is perhaps the only potential solution to the inadequate provision of information to agricultural decision-makers in Africa. Many countries in Africa now have full connectivity. Information generated all over the world and made available on the Internet can now be accessed by decision-makers. The many agricultural information discussion groups on the Internet can ensure that decisions by government planners and managers of agribusiness are based on adequate information. Decision-makers need to be trained on how to surf the Internet, and they should subscribe to the numerous discussion groups on agriculture on the Internet. Agricultural institutions that generate information must create their web sites to make this information available worldwide. This will ensure that decision-makers have access to information generated locally and abroad. Agricultural information personnel must be well trained on how to search the relevant web sites on the Internet for appropriate information, and they need to be trained on how to repackage information obtained from the Internet so as to be able to present concise information to decision-makers.

					<p> The role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is discussed from the standpoint of an information provider, CAB International, a not-for-profit organization. The advent of the Internet has meant a rethink of publishing initiatives in a variety of ways. The need for continuing sustainability has encouraged a mix of income from subscriptions, pay-per-view and sponsorship. Expectations of integrated content have led to the generation of a wider range of content types, along with the re-purposing of information and collaboration with, or linking to, other providers to gain critical mass. Authors are questioning the role of the publisher and the allocation of copyright, especially in the scientific, technical, and medical arena. The need to invest in technology is critical yet difficult at a time when costs associated with print cannot be discontinued. The development of effective ICTs is expensive and therefore should be collaborative with different organizations working together to understand their own competitive advantages, their own customers and the value that they each add to the information chain. Only through such concerted effort can information be passed on effectively to enhance the knowledge of those who are central to the improvement of rural livelihoods. From author's summary.</p>

					<p> A computer-based stratified selection methodology that allows users to create focused selections of the germplasm with a broad representation of the diversity in the domain of interest is described. It was developed for the germplasm collection of sorghum, pearl millet, chickpea, pigeon pea, and groundnut, which is maintained at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) under an agreement signed with FAO and Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). It contains in excess of 111 000 accessions. The size of the stratified selection can be chosen to be between 1 and 10% of the total collection size. The user can choose the selection algorithms based on either the proportional or logarithmic sampling strategy. The system selects a minimum of 1 entry/group to ensure the representation of small groups. Both the information on the accessions and the stratified core selection program are available on the Internet.</p>

					<p>Food and Nutrition Security Information (FNSI) is a critical tool for achieving food and nutrition security, yet FNSI efforts to date have not produced the intended &nbsp;impacts on policy and programme decision making, largely due to shortcomings in available technologies and frameworks. This article by Nancy Mock and &nbsp;colleagues from Tulane University reviews the evolution of FNSI efforts in the context of emerging technology and data collection techniques. A conceptual framework &nbsp;is provided to describe the evolution towards an FNSI characterised by integrating conventional and novel approaches to the collection, analysis and communication &nbsp;of information into a value stream that supports decision making to achieve food security. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211912412000351?np=y" target="_self">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211912412000351?np=y</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Global Food Security</i>, Vol. 2 Iss. 1, 01/03/2013) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>This case study published by IFPRI is about public agricultural extension systems and the inadequate consultation of farmers about their information needs and poor understanding of their information search strategies. The authors believe that in discussing and implementing extension programmes and advisory services, the following questions need to be addressed: What information do the farmers need? How and where do they search for information? What factors determine their search behaviour? How much are they willing to pay for information? While the first two questions are addressed fairly well in the literature, the latter two have not yet been dealt with in the context of developing countries.

	The XVIII International Botanical Congress held in Melbourne, Australia in July 2011 approved sweeping changes to the way scientists name new plants, algae, and fungi. The changes will allow online-only publication of names of new taxa from 1 January 2012. Electronic material published online in Portable Document Format (PDF) with an International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) or an International Standard Book Number (ISBN) will constitute effective publication. The requirement for a Latin description or diagnosis for names of new taxa of algae, fungi, and plants will be changed to a requirement for a description or diagnosis in either Latin or English. In addition, effective from 1 January 2013, new names of organisms treated as fungi must, in order to be validly published, include in the protologue (everything associated with a name at its valid publication) the citation of an identifier issued by a recognized repository.(<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-09/pp-rct091411.php" target="_blank">Eurekalert</a>, 14/9/2011)</p>

					<p> News bulletin service to Australian rice growers via the Ricegrowers' Association (RGA) website In 200 a pilot project to provide a news bulletin service to Australian rice growers via the <a href="http://www.rga.org.au/" target="_blank">Ricegrowers' Association (RGA) website</a> was carried out. First, a subgroup of the Rice Research and Development Committee identified a preferred approach based on its perceived cost-effectiveness and &quot;best fit&quot; with growers needs. The primary aim of the pilot was to help growers manage the increasing amounts of information from various sources they need to process if they are to operate their rice business in the most effective and efficient manner. Software included a database module known as SoW and a rice industry specific search engine, the RIO. The challenges that had to be overcome included: growers' inexperience with the Internet; a fear of the technology; matching the very low allocation of time given to reading such information; and, supplying information growers would find of value. E-mail addresses for over 400 growers were collected and a person was assigned to collect articles and place them on the website. After 7 bi-weekly editions, questionnaire results showed that almost 100% of the respondents were very satisfied with the system.</p>
