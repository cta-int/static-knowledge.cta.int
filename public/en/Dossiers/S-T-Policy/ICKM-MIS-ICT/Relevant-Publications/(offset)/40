						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p> Simple-to-use computer program helps soybean farmers in decision making. Soybean farmers make decisions based on diverse information. However, one tool not widely utilized is crop simulation. Perceived barriers are burdensome inputs, user unfriendliness, and hard-to-interpret results. A new approach is presented, combining the CROPGRO-Soybean model with a window-based, user interface addressing these problems. The resulting, simple-to-use program, PCYield, contains features of more complex systems including (1) field-specific data management; (2) Internet access to real-time weather data; (3) production risk indicators; and (4) graphical outputs. A unique aspect of this project was the participation of a private weather data corporation and, through them, a national chain of agricultural input and service providers. The project history, developmental policy issues, technical problems, market testing and subsequent software privatization are described. Positive producer reactions have included requests for more advanced features. This suggests that grower acceptance of complex models can be gained over time by beginning with simple aids and enhancing them with user-requested upgrades.

					<p> Making knowledge about the Plant Resources of Tropical Africa available through Internet databases, books, CD-Roms, and derived products such as brochures, leaflets, and manuals. PROTA, short for &quot;Plant Resources of Tropical Africa&quot;, is an international programme focused on the 7000 useful plants of Tropical Africa. Its purpose is to make available the wealth of dispersed knowledge on these plant resources for education, extension, research and industry through Internet databases, books, CD-Roms, and derived products such as brochures, leaflets, and manuals. A thorough knowledge of the plant resources is essential for arriving at ecologically balanced and sustainable land-use systems. A large international team of experts is contributing the texts on particular species. All species are described according to a standard format with details on uses, trade, properties, botany, ecology, agronomy or silviculture, genetic resources, breeding, prospects and literature. The outline of the PROTA Programme and the elements of the PROTA Information Base are briefly described. A sample of the PROTA Information Base is presented; it consists of 39 plant species, representing all 16 commodity groups distinguished in the Information Base.</p>

					<p> Agricultural informatics in India is moving toward sharing of information in agricultural innovation networks. The development and future of agricultural informatics in India is discussed. The core objective of agricultural informatics in India is to build capacity in agriculture-related institutions to effectively use new information technology (IT). India initiated the Agricultural Research Information System (ARIS) in its national agricultural research system in 1996. By providing computer access to a large number of scientists and teachers, ARIS encouraged the use of new IT applications in agricultural research. Agricultural informatics in India now includes: the creation of institutional databases; geographical information systems; decision support systems; modelling, simulation, and forecasting; market information for farmers; and, genetics and bio-informatics. The use of Internet technologies and the Internet for education and extension appears to be on the horizon. The future of agricultural informatics in India is moving toward the sharing of information in the agricultural innovation networks through programmes such as ARIS and through agricultural technology information centres.

					<p> Database with information on forest tree species and the management of their genetic resources. The worldwide information system on forest genetic resources (REFORGEN) is available on the Internet at the FAO (www.fao.org). It is a database with information on forest tree species and the management of their genetic resources. REFORGEN was initiated in 1993. In 2000, the system had data on more than 1600 species in 146 different countries. It was developed for use by national institutions who, at the same time, are the main providers of information. Information is divided in 2 major groups: data by species with related activities in a given country, and data on institutions dealing with forest genetic resources in a given country. Information topics include: (1) species origin; (2) species management; (3) main uses of the species; (4) main threats, if endangered; (5) in situ conservation activities; (6) ex situ conservation activities; (7) tree improvement activities; (8) availability of reproductive material; (9) name of institution; (10) address, telephone, fax number and e-mail address; (11) name of contact person in the organization; (12) type of organization; (13) main activities of the organization.</p>

					<p>This research paper describes the series of scientific and conceptual tools framed into the agro-ecology domain and explains how appropriate they are in planning sustainable agricultural production processes. By studying a target agro-ecosystem the authors show it is possible to identify and characterize the relationships between both the internal components and the system structures and functions at different levels of complexity of plot, farm and country, without neglecting the interactions among scientific, technological and socio-economic factors. They conclude that a key aspect to empower all the stakeholders involved in the research, development, dissemination and application of new methods and technologies is the identification of information and communication systems that farmers and policy makers need in order to cope with fast-changing conditions in complex systems. They see university and research centres as institutional facilitators of dialogue and development policies among different stakeholders, catalyzing participation and promoting participatory problem-solving strategies for agricultural development and cooperation.&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.agronomy.it/index.php/agro/article/view/ija.2012.e36" target="_blank"><i>Italian Journal of Agronomy</i></a>, Vol 7, No 3, 2012)&nbsp;</p>

					<p> Information systems aim to employ the Internet to improve the linkages between agricultural research and extension Stakeholders and decision-makers need reliable, detailed information about the extent of the problem of food insecurity and the people it affects to be able to take effective action to reduce hunger and ensure food security. New information and communication technologies allow us to link national information systems and establish global networks. FAO's World Agricultural Information Centre (WAICENT) assists member nations and regional organizations in establishing or strengthening information centres and systems through capacity-building activities (e.g. training courses and field projects), and using the latest technology and tools. Information systems (e.g. AGRIS and CARIS) have been developed in more than 160 countries and others such as FIVIMS (Food Insecurity and Vulnerability Information and Mapping System) and KIMS (Key Indicators Mapping System) are being implemented. A pilot project is planned to develop the Virtual Extension Research and Communication Network (VERCON); it aims to employ the Internet to improve the linkages between agricultural research and extension.</p>

					<p> E-marketing, technology transfer, and intellectual property. An overview of the current status of Internet-based technology transfer services is provided. Special reference is made to the situation in Asia. Subjects include: (1) e-marketing of intellectual property; (2) Internet-enabled technology transfer; (3) technology licensing in an on-line era; and (4) a web-enabled business model from India. In 2001, more than 40 Intellectual Property Portals (IPPs) were identified. More than half of these IPPs were launched in 1999 or later. Each IPP intends to harness Internet search capabilities to link buyers and sellers of technology. The different business models are described. There is some question which business model will prove a long-term success. Technology transfer companies and institutions are compared, including Delphion and the Asian and Pacific Center for Transfer of Technology. An annotated list of selected web sites on technology transfer and intellectual property is presented. Conventional channels for buying, selling and licensing technologies are both inefficient and lacking in scope. The need for technology licensing over the Internet is illustrated with a case study of how 2 companies benefited from such a web-based service.</p>

					<p> Collaboration, networking, communication and regional co-operation between partner projects, and use of ICTs have strengthened the Community Biodiversity Development and Conservation Programme in its understanding and strengthening the farming systems of rural communities The Community Biodiversity Development and Conservation Programme (CBDC) is a global programme that aims to understand and strengthen the farming systems of rural communities. Its key objective is to combine biodiversity management with sustainable development activities at farm community levels. Its strengths lie in its ability to relate to rural communities and use their initiatives in project implementation and the problem-solving spirit of its project partners. Active collaboration between its 14 key groups (members) is achieved through networking that involves communication and regional co-operation between partner projects in South-East Asia, Africa, Latin America, Europe and Canada. The CBDC has used modern Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) such as the Internet to promote continued close communication links between its members, develop its own website and create an online learning model. These and other challenges and successes experienced when building up the CBDC communications network are examined in detail.</p>

					<p> Still need for tools and practical examples. A technical consultation on assessing the performance and impact of agricultural information products and services (AIPS) was held in Bonn, Germany, in Oct. 2001. It was preceded by an e-consultation through the IMPACT workspace of the Learning and Evaluation Action Program (LEAP). The main objective was to facilitate the development and use of practical and cost-effective methods for evaluating the performance and impact of AIPS. Expected outputs included guidelines on best practices for evaluating the performance of AIPS and clearly defined approaches among partner organizations for supporting the development and refinement of specific evaluation tools. The following subjects were dealt with: (1) conceptual frameworks and methodologies for evaluating AIPS; (2) concepts and terminology; (3) principles of evaluation; (4) characteristics of agricultural information; (5) assessing the impact of information from a newsletter and a training seminar; (6) use, benefits and constraints of connectivity in Africa; and (7) impact assessment of the Dissemination of Agricultural Reference Books (DORA) programme of the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA) in Nigeria. One of the conclusions was that there is still a need for tools and practical examples.</p>

					<p> Use of computers to facilitate communication, retrieve information from the Internet, and establish a reporting system on pesticide poisoning cases. In 1998, the Global Pesticide Project (GPP) was launched in response to the scale of poisonings and worker ill-health related to pesticide use in the tropics. The project focused on 4 pilot countries in Africa (Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe) and 6 priority crops (banana, cocoa, coffee, cut flowers, sugar cane, and tea). The objectives have been to: (1) promote sustainable agriculture and draw attention to pesticide hazards; (2) link with civil society organizations (the Pesticide Action Network, PAN); (3) establish contacts with national and international decision-makers; and (4) engage the pesticide industry. The project targeted grass roots trade union members, shop stewards, branch officials, national union leaders, international policy makers, and consumer organizations. Modern computers were provided for labour union headquarters in all GPP countries to facilitate communication between the unions, help them retrieve information from the Internet, and to establish a reporting system on pesticide poisoning cases. In the future, GPP will encourage training in integrated pest management, advocate improved standards, and lobby for recognition of the problem in the new ILO (International Labour Organization) convention on health and safety in agriculture.</p>

This represents about 82% of the world holdings. It includes data sets from 21 institutions of 17 countries. Advanced cultivars are best represented in the database, followed by wild species and landraces. Of the cultivated material, the Butter-head types are the most frequent, followed by Cos, Crisp and Cutting types. The accessions of wild species consist, for the largest part, of Lactuca serriola. The database is available on the Internet on-line and can also be downloaded. The database can be of help to breeders and other scientists in selecting material for their research, and curators who must make collection management decisions. It currently gives only information on passport data. Information on availability of the material and evaluation data are not yet included. The database will be updated and analysed in the future.</p>

They suggest that index insurance could not only provide an additional effective, market-mediated solution to promote agricultural development, but it could also make disaster relief more effective. </p>

					<p> There has been a steady increase in the use of the Internet in developing countries, yet this expansion still remains primarily an urban phenomenon. Ethiopia has been connected to the Internet since 1997; however, the country's agricultural sector has not yet been able to use the Internet optimally to achieve sustainable agricultural development and combat rural poverty. Areas in which the Internet is being used in Ethiopia are described, and the current state of information and communication technology and the Internet, particularly in the agricultural sector, is explored. The potential opportunities, practical challenges, and prospects the Internet holds for the agricultural sector are highlighted. Internet usage and access to the Internet for the management of agricultural information at all levels needs to be reconsidered. Opportunities to foster indigenous and appropriate applications of the Internet in the agricultural sector are examined. From author's summary.</p>

					<p>
Knowledge sharing is the best way to help drive increased agricultural productivity in Africa, according to the African Forum for Agricultural Advisory Services (AFASS). The organisation outlined the recommendation in its four-year strategic plan that was developed at its most recent summit in Accra, Ghana. The four year plan advocates for a wider dissemination of research outputs, increasing the uptake of new and improved technologies (including biotechnology), and committing to additional research to help improve knowledge sharing in Africa. The plan’s ultimate goal is to bring all national agricultural advisors together under a single information-sharing platform.(ICTSD, April 2011)</p>

					<p> ICT advances boost promotion of knowledge-intensive Integrated Plant Nutrition Systems (IPNS). Integrated Plant Nutrition Systems (IPNS) is knowledge-intensive and global efforts to promote it have been going on for decades. Recent advances in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) have given a tremendous boost to these efforts. Since 1997, the Fertilizer Advisory Development and Information Network for Asia and the Pacific (FADINAP) has been working towards making its wealth of IPNS information resources accessible via the Internet. Its <a href="http://www.fadinap.org/" target="_blank">website</a> now receives over 10 000 hits a month and is the most visited site on the Internet on this subject. A description of the different functions and services of the site is presented along with useful information on other IPNS websites.</p>
