						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p> The potential efficacy of radio, telephony and the Internet as a tool of direct poverty alleviation in developing countries is reviewed. Information and communications technologies (ICTs) are powerful tools for empowerment and income generation in less developed countries. The cost-effectiveness of different ICTs does vary between industrialized and developing countries, however. While the requirements for their successful utilization make radio and telephone far more suitable technologies for the poor, traditional ICTs can act as a sustainable intermediary for them to gain indirect access to the power of the Internet. Governments should concentrate on opening up private and community provision of broadcasting and widening access to telephone services, so that they can effectively play this intermediary role.

					<p> Market information through radio broadcasts, Internet and mobile phones seemed of little use to Senegalese market gardeners who already used certain systems to manage uncertainty. The impact of public and private market information systems (MISs) on vegetable marketing in Senegal was studied, using information from the Niayes zone and the Senegal Valley. The public MIS provides market information through radio broadcasts. In 200 this system was complemented by a private MIS operated by Manobi, which uses Internet and mobile phones. It was found that the information transmitted by the MISs is of little use to Senegalese market gardeners. They already use certain systems to manage uncertainty. These involve the use of so-called &quot;coxers&quot;, who are specialized in gathering information related to rural and urban wholesale markets and possible transport arrangements. Paid by the unit, they limit their own risk and their partners' uncertainty. In other cases, merchants (so-called &quot;bana-banas&quot;) supply fertilizers and seeds to growers on credit to secure access to their products, in both terms of quantity and quality. It is suggested that the Manobi system will work better in situations where coxers are less represented. From authors' summary.</p>

					<p> At the University of Zimbabwe, 129 veterinary students were surveyed to determine their information needs and the sources of information used to meet these needs. The findings revealed that writing assignments and studying for tests or examinations were the primary tasks for which they required information. In descending order, the major sources used to meet these information needs were: books, videos, lecture notes and hand-outs, the Internet, projects, CD-ROM databases and journals. Unexpectedly, students made little use of indexes, abstracts and dissertations. This indicates that the library needs to employ a more proactive approach in teaching students how to fully exploit the resources available to them.</p>

In a number of papers, the issue of integrating technologies for environmental monitoring and information production is further developed. Several detailed examples are presented of successful projects and developments. It is observed that policy makers and scientists still tend to focus on their own field of expertise, ignoring that ?everything is connected to everything?. The workshop concluded that there is an urgent need to widely promote the integrated view.</p>

					<p>In this paper, Tinashe Mashavave at the Department of Soil Science &amp; Agricultural Engineering, University of Zimbabwe, and colleagues, explore the potential value of social interactions between smallholder farmers in improving integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) information and knowledge access and sharing, in the context of field-based learning alliances. Their study reveals that smallholder farmers within learning alliances had a denser network structure of social interactions. The magnitude of communication efficiency was generally higher for learning alliance participants than non-participants. Field-based learning alliances facilitated improved social interactions, subsequently shortening the innovation dissemination horizon and hence increasing the likelihood of ISFM adoption.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://purl.umn.edu/156980" target="_self">http://purl.umn.edu/156980</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(African Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics, 07/2013)&nbsp;</p>

					<p> The advantages and constraints of the Internet in developing countries are reviewed. In 2000, there were about 275 million users on the net, corresponding to 4.78% of the world population. In Africa, with about 734 million inhabitants, only 2.46 million or 0.34% of the population has access to the Internet. South Africa alone accounts for more than half of the African Internet users. The 3 prerequisites for using the Internet are a stable power supply, a telephone connection, and a computer with a modem. In most of the Third World these are simply not available. Internet costs in Africa are often prohibitive. In 1998, the average cost of a low volume Internet account amounted to US$ 58, nearly the per capita income of Mozambique. The expectations of the Internet as an affordable and useful means for the exchange of information between all people are discussed. An overview of international Internet development efforts in the fields of job creation, health, education, research, trade, commerce, government use, tourism, agriculture, gender and development, and environmental protection is provided. The Internet is compared with other information services, such as newspapers, radios and cinemas. It is concluded that the Internet cannot make up for the lack of resources devoted to health, education and other systems.</p>

					<p>Access to timely and reliable information on livestock production and marketing is important in addressing the production and marketing aspects of the sector alongside access to financial services. <a href="http://192.156.137.192/handle/10568/16518" target="_blank">This study</a> analyzes the intra-household disparities in access to information and financial services among rural households in selected districts in Kenya. Specifically, it compares women's access to information on livestock production and financial services with that of men. Results show that informal channels such as farmer to farmer interactions were the key sources of information for livestock production and marketing. Men in male headed households received more training and were exposed to greater and more varied topics than women. Men borrowed more from formal credit providers such as banks and co-operatives while women mainly borrowed from their community groups and neighbours. Analysis of determinants of savings by women revealed that women's age and education positively and significantly increase their probability to save. </p>

					<p> An overview of possibilities to exchange irrigation information: from registration at Virtual Library of Irrigation to guidelines for publishing on the Internet. An overview of irrigation information on the Internet is provided. Subjects include: (1) search and meta-search engines; (2) selected web sites dedicated to irrigation: (3) discussion lists dedicated to irrigation; (4) newsgroups with irrigation-related information; and (5) software programs on the Internet. All companies and organizations working in the field of irrigation are encouraged to register their web site at the Virtual Library of Irrigation. If there is no opportunity to publish own content on the servers of the Institution one is working with, everyone can get free web space offered by several companies. Guidelines for publishing irrigation information on the Internet are included. It is emphasized that despite the enormous general growth of the Internet, the availability of scientifically valid and approved information is disproportionally low and far from sufficient to meet the growing demand and expectations. In many low-income countries, financial and technical constraints severely limit the access to adequate and high-quality information. More than 8 international programmes to improve the communications and Internet facilities in developing countries have been initiated. Fibre-glass and satellite technologies are used by 2 major projects to improve Internet connectivity in Africa.</p>

					<p> Output rise when adopting a 2-way system of communication with farmers. A model of the role of knowledge and information in agricultural production was developed, based on a connectivity driven factor which includes interdependency, complementarities and spill over factors between agents. It is used to generate empirically testable hypotheses, where Indonesia's &quot;Green Revolution&quot; in the 1970s-1980s is taken as a case study. The ultimate goal is to characterize the knowledge and information transfer policies to alleviate poverty in Indonesia; such poverty occurred partially because of the gaps in citizens' acquisition of knowledge and information. The impact of knowledge and information transfers was found to depend on the size of a cluster (a subset of society where individuals repeatedly interact), the productivity of farmers, the level of farmers' education, and the amount of fertilizer used. Farmers in Java are more productive in rice cultivation than farmers from the rest of Indonesia. Agricultural extension workers have played an important role in making all of the above possible. Thus, enhancing the extension service agents' knowledge and information and implementing an effective dissemination policy will enable government to appropriately communicate its programmes to citizens. Significantly, output would rise if the government adopts a 2-way system of communication with farmers. From author's summary.

					<p> Maximize knowledge sharing and the build-up of crop biotechnology information among stakeholders in the developing country context The Global Knowledge Center on Crop Biotechnology (KC) was established in 2000 to be a virtual science-based information network responding dynamically to the needs of developing countries on all aspects of crop biotechnology, particularly genetically modified crops. More specifically, it seeks to help national programmes facilitate the development of a policy environment conducive to the application of biotechnologies, and promote public understanding of scientific advances in crop biotechnology. The KC networks and shares information with and among the developing countries in Africa, Asia, and South America. Such activities include: global knowledge networking; information needs analysis and strategy design; repository building; and, information packaging. Basically, projects revolve around electronic networking through an Internet website, expert networking, and continuous scanning of the agricultural biotechnology environment. Multi-media communication approaches are also developed for sharing among various stakeholders. Issues related to the public understanding of science and technology are discussed. Strategies to maximize knowledge sharing and the build-up of crop biotechnology information among stakeholders in the developing country context are put forward. From author's summary.</p>

					<p> Communities share experiences. The steps involved in implementing an Integrated Systems for Knowledge Management (ISKM) approach to environmental management are examined, using experiences from case studies on integrated catchment management, biodiversity restoration, pest management, environmental conflict management, and tussock grassland management. The ISKM approach was developed in New Zealand to help communities share their experiences and observations to develop the knowledge needed for sound resource management decision-making. It builds on principles of community participation, constructivism and experiential learning, organizational learning, adaptive management, and systems thinking. The ISKM framework promotes participation and self-help in managing natural resource projects by providing clear communication pathways for dialogue and action. A major part of the initial steps in implementing ISKM is involving stakeholders in developing a common understanding of the perceived issue and deciding collectively on the project goals, and the different roles that groups will undertake. Other steps in the iterative process are: (1) accessing relevant data, information and knowledge; (2) community dialogue; (3) information capture and dissemination, including Internet; (4) implementation; and (5) monitoring and evaluation.</p>

					<p>The ODI <a href="http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=6328&amp;title=aid-agriculture-food-security-measurement%20" target="_blank">Briefing Paper 72</a> explores the flow of aid to agriculture and reviews how it is measured and counted in terms of overall Overseas Development Assistance. Based on this analysis, the researchers argue: Recent aid pledges to agriculture reveal flaws in the system for identifying and classifying such aid; a purposeful measure of aid to agriculture is required to improve transparency and accountability; the different policy objectives behind aid to agriculture need to be separated to help establish results-based aid.

					<p>While helping farmers manage production and market risks, obtain good prices and reduce wastage, this research by CIMMYT found that Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) still need better supporting infrastructure in rural areas, improved small farmers technical literacy and more inclusive business models. Mobile telephony has been the most recent and widely-accepted mode of delivering information. Increasing mobile phone and mobile phone-based services enhances the availability of content-specific information, and also helps to improve awareness, education, the better adoption of technology, better health and efficiency, reduced transaction costs, greater market efficiency and better climate-linked risk management<a href="http://purl.umn.edu/147107" target="_self">http://purl.umn.edu/147107</a>(CIMMYT Working paper 3, 04/2012)</p>

					<p> Project initiated in response to a need to promote online information sharing and enhanced communication The Electronic Networking Project (ENP) was launched in Nepal with the support of Canada's International Development and Research Centre (IDRC). With the advent of the Internet in Nepal in 1995, the project was initiated in response to a need to promote online information sharing and enhanced communication among research institutions within Nepal and globally. During the first 2 years of the ENP, a network of 34 organizations collectively established the NepalNet web site. This site has since become a well-known portal for information on sustainable development in Nepal. In addition to the project work relating to NepalNet, ENP has been successful in building capacities in use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region.</p>

					<p> OWSimu is a Java-based generic plant growth simulator. According to the principles of object-oriented design, Java classes were programmed for plant growth simulation as well as relevant input, output and user interfaces. The program was developed as a Java applet with a user-friendly graphical interface running on the Internet. With a Java (JDK1.1)-embedded Web browser, users can link the run-time model and perform plant growth simulations at the <a href="http://th190-50.agn.uiuc.edu/" target="_blank">website</a>. The OWSimu program is a convenient tool for researchers, teachers and students to use in the general study of plant growth. It describes the growth of a typical plant that is free of pests and diseases. The program is currently able to simulate plant growth for more than a dozen crops and weeds under Illinois (USA) weather and 3 typical soil conditions. Additional data are needed to modify OWSimu so that it can have a better C balance model for different plant species and accommodate different varieties within a selected plant species for use in a specific crop production management system. The program source code is highly re-usable for further development and for other crop modelling work. From abstract Elsevier Science Journal.</p>
