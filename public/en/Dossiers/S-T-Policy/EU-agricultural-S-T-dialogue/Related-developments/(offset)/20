						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Political momentum is growing in both Europe and Africa behind the idea that investment in research facilities is as important as investment in roads and schools for a country's development.&nbsp;This was the main conclusion to emerge from a two-day conference that took place as part of the meeting on <a href="http://www.globalsciencecollaboration.org/home" target="_blank">EU Science: Global Challenges &amp; Global Collaboration</a>, which ended in Brussels early March 2013. Those attending the meeting agreed that research infrastructures should be a priority focus of bi-regional cooperation in science, technology and innovation between Africa and the EU. While it is essential for politicians to be able to demonstrate to their electorates the direct benefits to be drawn from investment in research infrastructure, it was emphasised that demand for investment in research facilities needed to come from African countries themselves. In addition, attenders stressed the need to ensure that spending on infrastructure is complemented by investment in 'human capacity development'.&nbsp;Additional comments on the conference: '<a href="http://www.scidev.net/en/science-and-innovation-policy/finance/opinions/in-perspective-focus-cash-on-research-infrastructure-1.html?utm_source=K4DNewsletterEN&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_campaign=K4D_EN_Feb2013" target="_blank">In Perspective: Focus cash on research infrastructure</a>'&nbsp;(<a href="http://scidevnet.wordpress.com/2013/03/11/optimism-emerges-over-european-funding-for-african-research-facilities-in-africa" target="_blank">SciDev.Net</a>, 11/03/2013)&nbsp;</p>

					<p>The WWF reported in December 2012 how EU nations have followed scientific advice in only 13% of their decisions on setting fisheries quotas over the last decade. The quotas EU nations set for their fisheries are on average 45% higher than the scientific recommendations. The consequences of this bad decision-making are depleted fish stocks. The EU is working on a wholesale reform of its policies to kick in during 2014, seeking to tackle the problem of discards and subsidies for boats, which can contribute to overfishing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://phys.org/news/2012-12-eu-science-fish-quota.html" target="_blank">http://phys.org/news/2012-12-eu-science-fish-quota.html</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;(Phys.org, 14/12/2012)</p>

Worried that the international importance of Swedish research is declining, the KVA sought to understand the reasons and explore avenues to counteract the decline. Some reasons that were identified include: 1) the rapid increase in undergraduate education without adequate funding and the increasing separation of education from research; 2) the ongoing shift towards more strategic research and the increase in short-term external funding which has weakened the sector’s more challenging, investigator-driven basic research, which requires a longer-term view. The report recommended that the Swedish research universities take steps to improve conditions for research which a) give the universities more independence from government regulations and thus greater freedom; b) secure the universities’ long-term block funding for core, basic research; c) develop more efficient administration systems for operational sectors; undergraduate education, independent long-term academic research prioritized by the university, externally financed, targeted research and externally funded commercialization; d) establish internationally attractive research chairs and increase researchers’ national and international mobility and e) handle issues of intellectual property rights (IPR) more professionally.(<a href="http://www.kva.se/Documents/Vetenskap_samhallet/Forskningspolitik/2012/akademirapport_breakthrough_research_121209.pdf" target="_blank">KVA report</a> via <i><a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20121214121354858" target="_blank">University World News</a></i>, 16/12/2012)</p>

					<p>The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) is the central scientific network within the massive set of bureaucracies that is responsible for Europe's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). While spending the past 25 years failing to sustain Europe's fish stocks, this management system also became adept at making the lives of its scientists miserable. Now it is being confronted by the complex challenge of an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management. If this combination of a multi-national bureaucracy, hard politics, and scientific uncertainty has made it impossible to maintain many individual fish stocks, how are decisions going to be made that consider everything from sea birds to climate change? The old political saw that ‘if you can't solve a problem, make it bigger’ has never been put to a test like this! Yet ICES has begun to rise in an impressive way to the scientific challenge of providing advice for an ecosystem approach within the world's most cumbersome fisheries management system. <a href="http://www.doabooks.org/doab?func=fulltext&amp;rid=12747" target="_blank">This book</a> (PDF) lays out the results of extensive sociological research on ICES and the decision making systems into which it feeds. ICES is finding ways to provide effective advice in the many situations where scientific advice is needed but a clear, simple answer is out of reach. In spite of the difficulties, scientists are beginning to help the various parties concerned with management to deal with facts about nature in ways that are more useful and transparent.(Douglas C. Wilson, 2009)</p>

					<p>The overall objective of this FP7 project is to identify effective and efficient approaches for the support of successful LINSA (Learning and Innovation Networks for Sustainable Agriculture) as drivers of transition towards Agricultural Innovation Systems (AIS) for sustainable agriculture and rural development. In order to achieve this objective the project will:


Explore LINSAs empirically as bottom-up drivers of transition

Improve understanding of barriers to complex learning processes and developing recommendations on how to avoid / remove them

Create open learning spaces for actors outside the project by sharing and disseminating project findings

Identify institutional determinants that enable or constrain existing AKS in supporting effective LINSA in the context of changing knowledge and innovation policies

Develop a conceptual framework for innovation for sustainable agriculture and rural development.


The study will be carried out in 3 fields: (i) consumer oriented networks, (ii) non-food oriented networks and (iii) purely agricultural networks or networks for sustainable land use. Strategic objectives of the projects are to contribute to more effective research-practice linkages in the complex innovation and value chains, and to a policy framework for innovation in agriculture.</p>

					<p>by recent agronomic research. Christian Dupraz, a researcher at the National Institute for Agronomic Research (INRA) in Montpellier, has been studying this type of mixed farming for the past 20 years. He believes in the importance of switching to ‘agro-ecological’ systems that do not depend on the petrochemical industry. ‘The fertility of French land is due to its forests, which have enriched it with carbon. Planting trees can replace chemical fertilisers’, he said.(The Guardian, 21/8/2012)<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/21/agroforestry-france-farming-revival" target="_blank">http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/21/agroforestry-france-farming-revival</a></p>

					<p>These days, food can be kept a lot longer than in the past. But techniques such as pasteurisation and sterilisation also affect the quality of the products. The nutritional quality suffers, the product has less aroma and the flavour and smell of the food sometimes deteriorate. New, milder preservation techniques go a long way to preventing this loss of quality. Wageningen UR Food and Biobased Research have joined forces with a group of Dutch companies in the food industry to explore the application of these techniques.(<a href="http://www.wageningenuniversity.nl/UK/newsagenda/news/research_into_mild_preservation_techniques_for_food_products.htm " target="_blank">Wageningen UR</a>, 2/7/2012)</p>

					<p>In addition to industrial emission control, Norwegian efforts to restrict climate change have focused on mitigation through forest protection (REDD+) and clean energy (Energy+). A third area of attention is climate-smart agriculture. Producing food in a more ‘climate smart’ way is seen as having three advantages: 1) Providing food for an increasing population, 2) maintaining food production under a changing climate, and 3) reducing greenhouse gas emission from agriculture while absorbing carbon in vegetation and soil. This report explores how Norway can support Africa’s efforts to make agriculture more climate-smart through support to African universities.(Via <a href="http://www.eldis.org/go/what-s-new&amp;id=62310&amp;type=Document" target="_blank">Eldis</a>, 2012)</p>

					<p>Resilience of landscapes is sometimes stretched to a tipping point and adverse changes then follow quickly. At the moment, little is known about the connection between environmental stresses and catastrophic shifts. <a href="http://www.cascade-project.eu/" target="_self">CASCADE</a> will investigate a range of dryland ecosystems in southern Europe to study a range of physical and socio-economical drivers and obtain a better understanding of sudden shifts in drylands that may lead to major losses in biodiversity and concomitant ecosystem services. By focusing on vulnerable drylands as the target ecosystems, it builds further on existing knowledge regarding shifts in these ecosystems. CASCADE will improve our understanding of the biogeochemical mechanisms underlying sudden and catastrophic shifts, and of the key biotic and abiotic factors influencing these processes. The CASCADE approach will develop a common-ground participatory approach that will serve as the basis of the sustainable management of the ecosystems, the biodiversity within these ecosystems, and the services provided by the ecosystems.(via <a href="http://www.wageningenuniversity.nl/UK/newsagenda/news/cascade_180612_.htm" target="_blank">Wageningen University</a>, 18/6/2012)</p>

					<p>Lettuce growers could safely reduce the amount of irrigation water used on their fields by 25 %, so say researchers working on an ongoing EU-funded project into how climate change and globalisation affect the production of fresh produce. The findings of the Veg-i-Trade ('Impact of climate change and globalisation on safety of fresh produce governing a supply chain of uncompromised food sovereignty') project, coordinated by Mieke Uyttendaele from Ghent University in Belgium, show that using less water also helps increase the shelf life of fresh-cut lettuce, reduces farming costs and improves sustainability. One of the Veg-i-Trade partners has investigated the influence of different irrigation water doses on the quality and safety characteristics of two different types of fresh-cut lettuce: Romaine and Iceberg. The results show that using 25% less irrigation water prolongs the lettuce's shelf life, decreases browning on the cut edge of lettuce pieces and preserves microbiological quality.(<a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=EN_NEWS&amp;ACTION=D&amp;DOC=4&amp;CAT=NEWS&amp;QUERY=01389ecc7882:82e7:262c29c6&amp;RCN=34811%20" target="_blank">CORDIS</a>, 9/7/2012)</p>

					<p>Diffuse pollution from scattered sources on farms and fields, transported by runoff rainwater through the complex network of drains, ditches and streams in the countryside, poses a significant threat to water quality. New research led by Lancaster University (UK) indicates that farm ponds can significantly reduce agricultural pollution in the watershed. Environmental scientists have created ten new field wetlands in areas of unproductive farmland such as field corners and buffer strips. The field wetlands – single or paired ponds of varying designs and sizes – are being monitored to measure how much runoff, sediment and nutrients they can trap. Over three years, the monitored ponds have collected large quantities of sediment, acted as carbon sinks and helped reduced the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus in runoff waters.

					<p>EU Scientists warn that European restrictions on personal data endanger marine research and sustainability. A little-noticed tweak to one of the EU’s many rules and regulations is leaving fisheries scientists struggling to access vital data. The rule change means that raw data from devices used to monitor fishing vessels are no longer available to some scientists. This information is vital for proper, scientifically based management of Europe’s troubled fish stocks. At the heart of the problem is information from devices called Vessel Monitoring Systems, which are attached to many fishing boats to record their position, direction and speed. From these data, the boats' fishing patterns can be reconstructed, allowing researchers to assess fishing activity and, for example, examine the environmental impact on specific areas. In 2009 a new EC rule was brought in, restricting who could access what data within the EU. This rule took some time to filter through but it is now becoming apparent that the very detailed fisheries data needed by some academics are no longer available.

					<p>Private and public sector organisations from Thailand, Vietnam, Ghana, Nigeria, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK came together at the Natural Resources Institute, University of Greenwich, UK, in April 2012 to launch the new European Union Framework 7 funded project ‘Gratitude’ (Gains from Losses of Roots and Tuber Crops), and to begin the planning phase. The project aims to help small-holder farmers and small-medium enterprises to find and disseminate solutions that will reduce waste from postharvest losses of root and tuber crops and turn typically discarded by-products into something of increased value. By addressing food security, creating demand for root and tuber crops and improving efficiency at all stages along the value chain; this unique and innovative project will greatly improve the livelihoods of people with low incomes.

					<p>The Joint Programming Initiative <a href="http://www.faccejpi.com/" target="_blank">FACCE–JPI</a> has announced the approval for funding of its first joint action which brings together 67 research groups from 17 European countries. The initiative’s research agenda will address the modelling of impacts of climate change on European agriculture and food security and the reduction of uncertainties in climate change scenarios. An innovative, tailor-made instrument, a ‘Knowledge Hub’, was developed by the FACCE–JPI, associating three complementary dimensions: networking, research and capacity building.

					<p>The initiative ALLEA (All European Academies) released April 2012 the Declaration ‘Open Science for the 21st century’ to acknowledge Open Access as part of the future of Open Science. The declaration describes the vision of Open Science in the 21st century and lists the requirements that need to be fulfilled to realise this vision:


 Open Scientific Content arising from publicly funded research





 Open e-Infrastructures for public and private research





 Towards an Open Science Culture


It describes under the title ‘Making it happen’ how ALLEA and its member academies will advocate the adoption of Open Access and Open Science.(Via <a href="http://aims.fao.org/news/european-academies-declare-open-science-21st-century" target="_self">AIMS</a>, 04/2012)</p>
