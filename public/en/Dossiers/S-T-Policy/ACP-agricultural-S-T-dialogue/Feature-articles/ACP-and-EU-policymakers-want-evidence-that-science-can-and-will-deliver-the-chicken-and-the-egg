They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	Science is a critical instrument for growth and development. Such is the policy rhetoric of many ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) nations and their counterparts in the European Union (EU). The Heads of State of the African Union, for example, dedicated their 2007 Summit to the theme of science and technology (S&amp;T) and its contribution to Africa’s development (African Union, 2007), and have subsequently (at regular intervals) endorsed efforts to implement “Africa’s Science and Technology Consolidated Plan of Action” (New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), 2005). Science and innovation is also at the heart of the EU’s “Europe 2020” strategy for sustainable growth (European Commission, 2010). In recent years, for example, emphasis has been given to ensuring a greater focus on research and innovation as part of the spending priorities of the EU’s structural and regional funds, instruments targeted at boosting economic growth in the EU’s less-developed regions.</p>

Such is the policy rhetoric of many ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) nations and their counterparts in the European Union (EU). The Heads of State of the African Union, for example, dedicated their 2007 Summit to the theme of science and technology (S&amp;T) and its contribution to Africa’s development (African Union, 2007), and have subsequently (at regular intervals) endorsed efforts to implement “Africa’s Science and Technology Consolidated Plan of Action” (New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), 2005). Science and innovation is also at the heart of the EU’s “Europe 2020” strategy for sustainable growth (European Commission, 2010). In recent years, for example, emphasis has been given to ensuring a greater focus on research and innovation as part of the spending priorities of the EU’s structural and regional funds, instruments targeted at boosting economic growth in the EU’s less-developed regions.</p><p>This article will interrogate whether the apparent policy consensus on “science for development” has translated into the ACP-EU partnership being leveraged in a concerted manner to exploit the potential of science to enrich development cooperation between the ACP and the EU, i.e. in the manner which policymakers often declare to be “objective”. The assessment will briefly review developments in this regard over the past ten years, examining whether ACP and EU policymakers are indeed convinced, as their policy pronouncements would suggest, that science can and will deliver, and whether they are consequently prioritizing a focus on science as part of their cooperation programmes. In conclusion, looking to the future, the role of a strengthened ACP-EU S&amp;T policy dialogue in enhancing science for development initiatives will be considered.</p><p>The first ACP-EU Forum on Research for Sustainable Development held in Cape Town in July 2002 had seemingly marked a new beginning for the role of S&amp;T in ACP-EU collaboration when the senior ACP and EU representatives present, adopted the so-called “Cape Town Consensus”, outlining an ambitious plan to enhance S&amp;T cooperation (ACP-EU, 2002). The document had notably called for the “most effective utilisation” of funding instruments such as the EU’s Sixth Framework Programme (FP6) for Research (<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp6/index_en.cfm" target="_self">http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp6/index_en.cfm</a>) as well as the Ninth European Development Fund (EDF) (<a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/development/overseas_countries_territories/r12102_en.htm" target="_self">http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/development/overseas_countries_territories/r12102_en.htm</a>) to support S&amp;T cooperation. The ACP-EU Forum had preceded the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), which, a few weeks later in its “Johannesburg Plan of Implementation”, had committed the global community to “build greater capacity in science and technology for sustainable development” (WSSD, 2002). Indeed, it can be argued that one of the strategic outcomes of the WSSD was a firm policy consensus that science should not be seen as a reward for development, but, on the contrary, as a critical instrument to enable development.</p><p>It would, thus, seem that in 2002, an enabling policy environment was put in place for a significant strengthening of ACP-EU S&amp;T cooperation. Between 2002 and 2006, ACP research groups did indeed collaborate with success with European partners under the FP6, chiefly in projects related to health, environment and agriculture research funded through a dedicated activity supporting cooperation with developing countries. Despite the discontinuation of the latter activity following the mainstreaming of international cooperation as part of the Framework Programme’s main research themes, important ACP-EU cooperation continued under the new Seventh Framework Programme (FP7, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp7/index_en.cfm" target="_self">http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp7/index_en.cfm</a>) launched in 2006.</p><p>Under FP7, which will run until 2013, ACP involvement is marked by a significant participation by African researchers in particular. This success is due notably to a dedicated call for proposals targeting cooperation with Africa, published in 2009, with funding of more than €63 million, implemented as part of the Science, Information Society and Space Action Plan of the Joint Africa-EU Strategy (European Commission, 2009). The initiative was implemented through competitive calls for proposals administrated by the European Commission, inviting proposals from consortia of research groups. It is, however, unclear how much of the success of cooperation under the Framework Programmes can be ascribed to policy directions from the ACP-EU institutional partnership.</p><p>The Cape Town Consensus had, however, not only identified the Framework Programmes as instrument to support ACP-EU S&amp;T cooperation, but perhaps even more strategically, also the vast resources of the 9th EDF, which for the period of 2000 to 2007 had a total budget of €13.5 billion. The EDF is of course a specific instrument of the ACP-EU partnership and policymakers have a direct input into the identification and preparation of funded activities. It took several years to prepare, winding its way through various administrative procedures, but in 2009 a dedicated and first “ACP Science and Technology Programme”, jointly funded through the 9th EDF and the EU Development Cooperation Instrument for South Africa, was launched.</p><p>This programme, with a total budget of approximately €35 million, was a direct response to the commitments of the Cape Town Consensus, and specifically targeted investment in S&amp;T capacity-building in the ACP. Several projects are currently being funded as part of the Programme. Furthermore, as part of the 10th EDF, which covers the period from 2008 to 2013, with a budget of more than €22 billion, support is being provided for a dedicated ACP Caribbean and Pacific Research Programme for Sustainable Development (<a href="http://www.acp-st.eu/content/acp-caribbean-pacific-research-programme-sustainable-development-0" target="_self">http://www.acp-st.eu/content/acp-caribbean-pacific-research-programme-sustainable-development-0</a>), with a budget of approximately €5 million; as well as to the African Union’s Research Grant Programme (<a href="http://www.africahrst.org/stict/rgp/" target="_blank">http://www.africahrst.org/stict/rgp/</a>), with a budget of €15 million.</p><p>Whilst these programmes represent important breakthroughs with regard to leveraging development cooperation resources such as the EDF for S&amp;T capacity-building in a specific manner, the total funding involved is still comparatively small, especially if seen within the context of the impressive overall amounts of the 9th and 10th EDF budgets. The vast majority of EDF funding is, however, implemented as part of the National Indicative Programmes, as agreed by the EU with individual ACP states or as part of the Regional Indicative Programmes agreed with entities such as the Regional Economic Communities in Sub-Saharan Africa. Under the 9th and 10th EDF, very few of the National and Regional Indicative Programmes prioritized S&amp;T cooperation in a specific manner. Cooperation in areas such as food safety, natural resource management, public health, energy and indeed human capital development do, however, often include strong S&amp;T or related components, but they do not target knowledge generation and innovation capacity-building including research collaboration as specific priorities in their own right.</p><p>This result may seem surprising, given the “policy consensus” to support S&amp;T cooperation in a dedicated manner, as referred to above. It should, however, be borne in mind that whilst documents such as the Cape Town Consensus were approved by policymakers representing S&amp;T authorities and institutions, the governance of development cooperation instruments such as the EDF was typically the preserve, on both the ACP and EU sides, of officials with responsibility for development, macro-economic or national planning policies and programmes.</p><p>It could, thus, be argued that if S&amp;T did not feature more prominently in the National and Regional Indicative Programmes of the EDF, S&amp;T policymakers have not been entirely successful in convincing their peers (who hold the purse strings of these instruments), that “science can and will deliver” in supporting the objectives of the ACP-EU development partnership. To address the situation and make “the case” for science more effectively, a vigorous policy dialogue on the role of S&amp;T and its contribution to development is needed. Critically, to be effective, such a dialogue should also involve policymakers and stakeholders from beyond the strict S&amp;T domain, i.e. including not only finance ministries and treasuries, but also for example representatives from economic, health, education, environment, energy or agriculture authorities, and where appropriate also from civil society and industry.</p><p>The objective of this enhanced dialogue should be to avoid the “chicken and egg” debate often marring science for development efforts. The dilemma presents itself in the debate thus: that from the non-S&amp;T practitioner’s perspective, development funds can only be allocated to support S&amp;T programmes once it can be demonstrated that such programmes effectively deliver on development objectives. On the other hand, from the S&amp;T perspective, it is argued that more funding is first needed to ensure meaningful implementation of S&amp;T activities, in order to demonstrate a tangible impact on development. The policy interrogation, regarding whether to first analyse impact or increase funding, i.e. the chicken or the egg, is an unnecessary one and distracts from the pertinent issues at hand.</p><p>To avoid that futile discussion, an enhanced policy dialogue is suggested, which will not only ensure better communication of and appreciation for the results and impact of existing S&amp;T cooperation programmes, but also enable the participation of other relevant stakeholders in the preparation of S&amp;T initiatives, which will facilitate an early identification of the development impact. The absence of the latter involvement, an obvious but essential step, significantly hampers the development of effective national systems of innovation. The same dynamics apply to the ACP-EU relationship. Whether within a bilateral context, i.e. between the respective ACP government and EU when frameworks such as the EDF National Indicative Programme are being prepared, or within multilateral forums, for example when preparing regional programmes, it is, thus, essential for S&amp;T policymakers to vigorously engage with their counterparts from other policy domains.</p><p>The perception to dispel at all costs is that the objective is to leverage science funding for the sake of science only. The “science for development” case does, however, consist of two equally important components, namely: on the one hand, investment in developing countries’ own research and innovation capacities to enhance their competitiveness and human capital; and on the other, the application of applied research results to effectively advance the fight against poverty, for example in areas such as water and sanitation, food security or small-enterprise development. It is, however, not a question of choosing between these two focus areas. In their discussions on science and development, it would be important for policymakers involved to accordingly adopt a holistic approach to science for development incorporating both dimensions. There should for example be no forced discrimination between basic or applied research, since when considered in an integrated manner as part of a comprehensive S&amp;T policy framework, both can be harnessed for development.</p><p>As outlined above, significant progress has been achieved over the past ten years in building ACP-EU S&amp;T partnerships. Certainly the role of S&amp;T as an instrument for development has never enjoyed so much attention from policymakers. ACP and EU policymakers are undoubtedly convinced that science can and will deliver, but on the other hand the opportunities afforded by cooperation instruments have not been optimally leveraged. Once provided with even more compelling evidence, policymakers can achieve much more, as demonstrated by examples such as the dedicated Innovation for Poverty Alleviation Sector Budget Support Programme of the South African Department of Science and Technology (European Commission, 2008). This Programme, funded for an amount of more than €30 million under the EU Development Cooperation Instrument for South Africa (the South African equivalent of an EDF National Indicative Programme), should be an inspiring example for replicating such programmes elsewhere in the ACP.</p><p>There is, therefore, no reason to ponder the chicken and egg. Science can and has delivered, and providing more evidence of this impact should be a natural part of a virtuous innovation circle.</p><p><b><b>References</b></b></p><p>
