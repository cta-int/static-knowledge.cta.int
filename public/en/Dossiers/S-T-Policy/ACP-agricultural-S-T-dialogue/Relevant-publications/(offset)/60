						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) is the central scientific network within the massive set of bureaucracies that is responsible for Europe's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). While spending the past 25 years failing to sustain Europe's fish stocks, this management system also became adept at making the lives of its scientists miserable. Now it is being confronted by the complex challenge of an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management. If this combination of a multi-national bureaucracy, hard politics, and scientific uncertainty has made it impossible to maintain many individual fish stocks, how are decisions going to be made that consider everything from sea birds to climate change? The old political saw that ‘if you can't solve a problem, make it bigger’ has never been put to a test like this! Yet ICES has begun to rise in an impressive way to the scientific challenge of providing advice for an ecosystem approach within the world's most cumbersome fisheries management system. <a href="http://www.doabooks.org/doab?func=fulltext&amp;rid=12747" target="_blank">This book</a> (PDF) lays out the results of extensive sociological research on ICES and the decision making systems into which it feeds. ICES is finding ways to provide effective advice in the many situations where scientific advice is needed but a clear, simple answer is out of reach. In spite of the difficulties, scientists are beginning to help the various parties concerned with management to deal with facts about nature in ways that are more useful and transparent.(Douglas C. Wilson, 2009)</p>

					<p>Many Africans are presently confronted with nutritional insecurity as their diets are often deficient in essential vitamins and minerals owing to lack of sufficient consumption of fruit and vegetables. This results from problems of availability, affordability and lack of knowledge. There has been a substantive, long-term underinvestment in research and development of the horticultural sector in Africa with particular reference to those indigenous crops which are naturally high in nutritious vitamins and minerals. Lack of breeding effort, ineffective seed supply systems and an inadequate information, regulatory and policy framework have all contributed to the widespread occurrence of malnutrition on the continent. However, public sector research, development and policy amelioration efforts supported by a nascent private seed supply sector are now showing progress. Many new, improved, nutrient-dense indigenous and standard vegetable varieties are being released for which smallholder farmers are finding growing markets in both rural and urban settings. If such developments continue favourably for the next decade, it is expected that progress towards a reduction in poverty and malnutrition in Africa will be marked.(<i><a href="http://203.64.245.61/fulltext_pdf/E/2011-2015/e04523.pdf" target="_blank">Food Security</a></i> 4:115-127, 2012 via <a href="http://avrdc.org/?p=3596" target="_blank">AVRDC</a>)</p>

					<p>The loss of genetic diversity of thousands of plants and crops has been well documented at least since the 1970s, and has been understood as a result of epistemological and political economic conditions of the Green Revolution. The political economic arrangement of the Green Revolution, alongside a post-war focus on economies of scale and export-oriented growth, replace high-yield single varieties of crops for a diverse array of varieties that may not have the same yield, but may be able to resist pests, disease, and changing climatic conditions. Also, the harvest does not flow in all directions equally: Whereas smallholder subsistence farming uses a large variety of crops as a food source and small-scale trade, the industrial economic system requires simplified, machine harvested ship-loads of one variety of maize, for example. Diverse varieties of different crops confound the machines, whereas one variety of wheat can be harvested with one setting on a machine. However, none of this is new. The purpose of <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/4/11/2970" target="_blank">this article</a> is to analyze how the twin concerns of lost varietals and lost cultures are bound together in the socio-political process of standardization, and to explain some areas of resistance.(<i><a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/4/11/2970" target="_blank">Sustainability</a></i> 2012, 4(11) via <a href="http://agro.biodiver.se/" target="_blank">Agricultural Biodiversity Weblog</a>, 7/11/2012)</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9781844078936" target="_blank">This book</a> addresses how the collective pooling and management of shared plant genetic resources for food and agriculture can be supported through laws regulating access to genetic resources and the sharing of benefits arising from their use. Since the most important recent development in the field has been the creation of the multilateral system of access and benefit-sharing under the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, many of the chapters in this book will focus on the architecture and functioning of that system. The book analyzes tensions that are threatening to undermine the potential of access and benefit-sharing laws to support the collective pooling of plant genetic resources, and identifies opportunities to address those tensions in ways that could increase the scope, utility and sustainability of the global crop commons.</p>

This report investigates why scientific evidence is important to policy making and argues that an extensive body of research on knowledge utilisation has not led to any widely accepted explanation of what it means to use science in public policy. For social scientists in a number of specialised fields, whether established scholars or PhD students, this book shows how to bring their expertise to bear on the study of using science to inform public policy. More generally, this report will be of special interest to scientists who want to see their research used in policy making, offering guidance on what is required beyond producing quality research, beyond translating results into more understandable terms, and beyond brokering the results through intermediaries, such as think tanks, lobbyists, and advocacy groups. For administrators and faculty in public policy programmes and schools, Using Science as Evidence in Public Policy identifies critical elements of instruction that will better equip graduates to promote the use of science in policy making.&nbsp;(NAP, 10/2012)</p>

					<p>Agriculture in Haiti has suffered three decades of crisis and institutional neglect. Nevertheless, almost 60% of Haitians live in rural areas and rely on farming for their livelihoods. For that reason, agriculture must play a central role in post-earthquake reconstruction. However, the plans and programmes of the Haitian government and the international community have proven insufficient to revitalize the sector and improve conditions for small-scale farmers, and have failed to recognise the important roles of women in agriculture.The Haitian government and the main actors in agriculture should continue to prioritise agricultural development, while putting greater emphasis on long-term programmes to assist Haitians to get back on their feet and improve their living conditions with dignity.(OXFAM Policy and Practice, 15/10/2012)<a href="http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/planting-now-2nd-edition-revitalizing-agriculture-for-reconstruction-and-develo-248432?cid=em_CPD_PPCT_1012_octnewsletter" target="_self">http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/planting-now-2nd-edition-revitalizing-agriculture-for-reconstruction-and-develo-248432</a></p>

					<p>The hypothesis of <a href="http://www.perscentrumrabobank.com/pressbasket/download?m_id=579" target="_blank">this study</a> is that the resolution of current and future imbalances in food supply is virtually inconceivable without tapping into the underused agricultural production potentials of existing small-scale farms in many developing and emerging economies. Written from an economic and business friendly perspective, this report by Rabobank researchers sees small farmers in developing countries and emerging economies are the key to a successful approach to the world food problem.As smallholder productivity is still very low, a large underexploited food production potential is yet to be unlocked. The establishment of farmer cooperatives would facilitates their connection to the markets and the international food chains and provides access to financial services. The authors argue that the productivity of smallholder agriculture may increase substantially through the interaction between commercial players in the food chain and farming organisations, as well as through partnerships with governments.(Rabobank Economic Research, 10/2012)News: <a href="https://www.pressroomrabobank.com/publications/food__agri/rabobank_cooperatives_small_farmers_in_developing_countries_key_to_successfully_solve_the_world_food_problem.html" target="_self">https://www.pressroomrabobank.com/publications/food__agri/rabobank_cooperatives_small_farmers_in_developing_countries_key_to_successfully_solve_the_world_food_problem.html</a>Report: <a href="http://www.perscentrumrabobank.com/pressbasket/download?m_id=579" target="_self">http://www.perscentrumrabobank.com/pressbasket/download?m_id=579</a></p>

					<p>This book assesses the institutional, technical and market constraints as well as opportunities for smallholders, notably emerging farmers in disadvantaged areas such as the former homelands of South Africa. Emerging farmers are previously disadvantaged black people who started or will start their business with the support of special government programmes. Public support programmes have been developed as part of the Black Economic Empowerment strategy of the South African government. These programmes aim to improve the performance of emerging farmers.This requires, first and foremost, upgrading the emerging farmers’ skills by providing access to knowledge about agricultural and entrepreneurial practices. To become or to remain good farmers they also need access to suitable agricultural land and sufficient water for irrigation and for feeding their cattle. Finally, for emerging farmers to be engaged in viable farming operations, various factors need to be in place such as marketing and service institutions to give credit for agricultural inputs and investments; input markets for farm machinery, farm implements, fertilizers and quality seeds; and accessible output markets for their end products.This book develops a policy framework and potential institutional responses to unlock the relevant markets for smallholders.PDF: <a href="http://www.doabooks.org/doab?func=fulltext&amp;rid=14597" target="_self">http://www.doabooks.org/doab?func=fulltext&amp;rid=14597</a></p>

					<p>In March 2012 the Future Agricultures Consortium and the Institute of Statistical, Social, and Economic Research co-hosted an international conference on 'Young People, Farming and Food' in Accra, Ghana. This conference examined how young people engage with the agri-food sector in Africa and how research findings were being integrated into policy processes.It also explored the dynamics of change in different components of the agri-food sector and the implications for young people. The articles in this IDS Bulletin are drawn from the conference. They discuss social and economic structures, aspirations, livelihoods, land and policy, and illustrate the multiple dimensions, scales and complex dynamics of the young people and agriculture 'problem' – and why simplistic 'solutions' are likely to fail. It is hoped that this collection will stimulate the research to fill an evidence gap of very significant proportions.(IDS Bulletin Vol. 43, Is. 6, 11/2012)<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/idsb.2012.43.issue-6/issuetoc" target="_self">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/idsb.2012.43.issue-6/issuetoc</a></p>

					<p>In the framework of the UNESCO-ICSU Science Forum for Rio+20, UNESCO and UNU launched the book 'Weathering Uncertainty: Traditional knowledge for climate change assessment and adaptation'. This resource draws attention to a rapidly growing scientific literature on the contribution of indigenous and traditional knowledge to understanding climate change vulnerability, resilience and adaptation. It broadens the awareness and understanding of these knowledge systems by climate change scientists and decision-makers.'This new book underlines the critical role that indigenous peoples and local communities can play in ongoing international efforts to monitor the progress of global climate change impacts and to develop capacities to respond', notes Dr Gretchen Kalonji, UNESCO’s Assistant Director-General for the Natural Sciences.(<a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/about-us/single-view/news/turning_tables_on_climate_change_indigenous_assessments_of_impacts_and_adapt/ " target="_blank">UNESCO</a>, 14/6/2012)</p>

					<p>The publication, <i>Growing greener cities in Africa</i>, is the first status report on African urban and peri-urban horticulture – the home, school, community and market gardens that produce fruits and vegetables in and around the continent's cities. The report draws on surveys and case studies from 31 countries across the African continent, and makes recommendations on how cities can better prepare to face the rapidly increasing demand for food and other basic amenities. <i>Growing greener cities in Africa</i> voices particular concern about the future of market gardening – the irrigated, commercial production of fruit and vegetables in designated or other urban areas.Market gardening is the single most important source of locally grown, fresh produce in 10 out of 27 countries surveyed, and the number-two source in six other countries. But market gardening has grown with little official recognition, regulation or support. In some cities, it is becoming unsustainable: to maximize returns, market gardeners have increased the use of pesticides and polluted water. The publication urges national governments and city administrations to work together with growers, processors, suppliers, vendors and others to give market gardens and urban and peri-urban agriculture the political, logistical and educational support necessary for sustainable development.(<a href="http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/greenercities/" target="_blank">FAO Media Centre</a>, 30/8/2012)</p>

The loss of biodiversity constitutes a critical problem for human existence, and biodiversity science is amply recognized as a priority area of scientific research worldwide. The International Council for Science (ICSU) Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean (ROLAC) conducted a regional consultation in March 2009 to identify the need for the development of a database of terrestrial and marine biodiversity in the region, as well as for a definition of policies and collection and data distribution protocols.This science plan analyse how LAC's biodiversity developed, and give an overview of the different aspects of biodiversity (bio-geographical divisions, ecosystems, species, genes). The assessment then examines the conservation of biodiversity and related research efforts in the region, before presenting existing institutional arrangements and resources for biodiversity research. The report finds that although many institutions are involved in biodiversity research, there is a lack of concerted action and of networking and data sharing among scientists in the region. The document identifies the main threats to biodiversity in LAC countries and research and actions priorities.</p>

					<p>The authors of <i>Strategies and Priorities for African Agriculture: Economywide Perspectives from Country Studies</i> published by IFPRI, argue that, although the diversity of the region makes generalization difficult, increasing staple-crop production is more likely to reduce poverty than increasing export-crop production. This conclusion is based on case studies of ten low-income African countries that reflect varying levels of resource endowments and development stages. The authors also recommend increased, more efficient public investment in agriculture and agricultural markets and propose new directions for future research.(IFPRI, 23/7/2012)<a href="http://www.ifpri.org/publication/strategies-and-priorities-african-agriculture" target="_blank">http://www.ifpri.org/publication/strategies-and-priorities-african-agriculture</a></p>

The study aims at proposing policies to ministries of agriculture, agricultural research institutions and extension agencies to advance the role of women working in agriculture in the region. The study combines a desk-study with literature, internet research and field studies in Jordan, Egypt and Tunisia. With limited resources the study team could only conduct field-research in three of the five WANA sub-regions. The study clearly illustrates the significant barriers rural women and female farmers face in the WANA region. The reasons are manifold, ranging from the limiting impact of the prevailing patriarchal gender paradigm on rural women, to gender-blind agricultural policies, insufficient human resources, lack of skills and know-how in agricultural institutions and organizations. Shortages of funds, weak commitment, gender equity on all levels and persistent gender stereotyping are common. The study concludes with the following key messages: 1) Persistent discrimination of women hold development back; and 2) Gender stereotyping in agricultural policy making, innovation and knowledge transfer still persists.(Published in 2012 by AARINENA)</p>

					<p><i>Jägerskog, A., Jønch Clausen, T. (eds.) 2012. Feeding a Thirsty World – Challenges and Opportunities for a Water and Food Secure Future. Report Nr. 31. SIWI, Stockholm.&nbsp;</i>This report provided input into the discussions at the 2012 World Water Week in Stockholm, under the theme of Water and Food Security. It features brief overviews of new knowledge and approaches on emerging and persistent challenges to achieve water and food security in the 21st century. Each chapter focuses on critical issues that have received less attention in the literature to date, such as: food waste, land acquisitions, gender aspects of agriculture, and early warning systems for agricultural emergencies. The analysis showed that there will not be enough water available on current croplands to produce food for the expected population in 2050 if we follow current trends and changes towards diets common in Western nations. The researchers found that industrialized nations currently get on average 20 percent of calories from animal protein (meat plus other products like milk and eggs). To produce the grain necessary to maintain that level and take it worldwide by 2050, farmers would need more usable water than the planet is capable of providing. What level would work, according to the researchers? There will be ‘just enough water’, they conclude, ‘if the proportion of animal-based foods is limited to 5 percent of total calories’. In other words, we non-vegans need to prepare ourselves and our children for radically different diets in the coming decades – eating about a quarter of the meat, eggs, cheese, etc we now do. Rather than relying heavily on animals for protein, we'll have to learn to consume much more of what we now feed animals: legumes and grains.Report:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.siwi.org/documents/Resources/Reports/Feeding_a_thirsty_world_2012worldwaterweek_report_31.pdf" target="_self">http://www.siwi.org/documents/Resources/Reports/Feeding_a_thirsty_world_2012worldwaterweek_report_31.pdf</a>Commentary: <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2012/08/want-avoid-thirsty-future-eat-less-meat" target="_self">http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2012/08/want-avoid-thirsty-future-eat-less-meat</a></p>
