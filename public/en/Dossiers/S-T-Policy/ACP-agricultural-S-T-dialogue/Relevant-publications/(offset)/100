						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>EIARD commissioned a study (Phases 1 and 2) to provide the European Initiative for Agricultural Research for Development (EIARD) with the knowledge and processes required to better coordinate and harmonise support to CAADP Pillar 4 both between EIARD members, and between EIARD members and other donors. The Phase 2 report presents the outputs of three country case studies in Benin, Tanzania and Zambia. Despite the data limitations, the results suggest that (i) there are still many issues over coordination, harmonisation and alignment of donor support; (ii) national systems are underfunded and understaffed and have imperfectly absorbed demand-led models resulting in a lack of strategic direction; and (iii) competitive grand funding, and the regionalisation of funds, may have tended to create supply-driven competition in which international and regional providers are better able to compete than national organisations.</p>

					<p>This January 2012 <a href="http://www.eiard.org/media/uploads/File/documents/policy%20briefs/EIARD%201.1%20capacity%20development%20for%20ARD%20policy%20brief%20final.pdf " target="_blank">paper</a> discusses issues related to support for capacity strengthening for agricultural research for development (ARD) by member countries of the European Initiative for Agricultural Research for Development (EIARD). It summarises the findings of an analysis of the policies, programmes and projects in capacity strengthening for ARD of fourteen European countries. These policies, programmes and projects were previously examined in relation to a common set of criteria covering aspects of needs identification, design, implementation, assessment, documentation and sharing of information. The findings are discussed in the context of emerging opportunities and challenges for capacity development for ARD and recommendations are made for improvements in the way that support is provided. Some key message: (i) Increasing support to capacity development for ARD is needed if the investment in ARD are to generate sustainable returns; (ii) Capacity strengthening initiatives should have a stronger focus on organizational and institutional strengthening as opposed to individual training; (iii) Multi-stakeholder initiatives should be encouraged as they are likely to lead to larger impacts than those targeted exclusively towards research organizations and institutes of higher education.</p>

					<p>This <a href="http://www.asareca.org/resources/reports/Impactsofanimprovedseedpolicyenvironment.pdf  " target="_blank">discussion paper</a> assesses the impacts of an improved seed policy environment in the Eastern and Central Africa (ECA) region using a case study of formal trade in seed maize in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania that employs a spatial equilibrium model (SEM). The paper commences by reviewing the progress made in the harmonization of seed policies in ECA region with regard to five thematic areas agreed for harmonization namely: (i) facilitation, building and empowering of public-private partnerships; (ii) observation of the importance and differences amongst technical, political and legislative stages in the process of reform; (iii) dialogue at two levels: national and regional; (iv) nurturing transparency, institutional cooperation and multi-disciplinarity; (v) differentiation between administrative/procedural and legislative issues in discussions and consensus building. The results of the welfare analysis give compelling evidence in support of an improved seed policy environment. While improved policy environment requires in contributions from many players and actors, it is assumed that harmonization of policies, laws and regulations is a critical addition to this process.</p>

					<p><i>University of California, Berkeley, Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, CUDARE Working Papers No. 1119.</i>This <a href="http://purl.umn.edu/120415" target="_blank">paper</a> provides an overview of the environmental, economical, and policy considerations related to biofuels. While the biofuel production and consumption exhibited significant increase over the first decade of the new millennium, this and further increases in biofuel production are driven primarily by government policies. Currently available first generation biofuels are with a few exceptions not economically viable in the absence of fiscal incentives or high oil prices. Also the environmental impacts of biofuels as an alternative to fossil fuels are quite ambiguous. The review of the most recent economic models dealing with biofuels and their economic impacts provides a distinction between structural and reduced form models. The review of reduced models is structured toward the time series analysis approach to the dependencies between prices of feedstock, biofuels, and fossil fuels.</p>

					<p>Fundamental components of RUFORUM’s strategic and operational plans are to develop competitive high quality regional MSc and PhD programmes for Eastern, Central and Southern Africa. A RUFORUM workshop on Quality Assurance raised the following issues (1) The new RUFORUM supported PhD programmes need to be developed using knowledge from other experienced systems, and (2) The RUFORUM regional PhD and MSc programmes are hosted by universities with different quality assurance systems at various levels of sophistication. The programmes are now being implemented, drawing resources from regional and global centres of knowledge through partnerships brokered and maintained by RUFORUM. Programme implementation requires a quality assurance mechanism that fosters high standards within the spirit of learning and co-sharing of knowledge. This brief draws on a scoping study commissioned by the RUFORUM Secretariat among selected Universities in Europe to draw lessons for a regional quality assurance and credit accumulation transfer system.

					<p><i>Jim Ryan. 2004. Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) Working paper No. 56.</i>&nbsp;In this paper, the author examines the range of indicators that are commonly used to define the nature and degree of poverty before summarising the current state of empirical knowledge of its location and extent. Follows a discussion of the relationships between income and food and nutrition security, which are the keys to understanding how R &amp; D interventions might influence the well-being of the poor. The empirical evidence on the linkages between agricultural R &amp; D, economic growth and poverty are explored. This includes a discussion of the relative productivity and poverty reduction benefits of public investments in R &amp; D and other infrastructure in irrigated versus rain-fed agriculture. The author argues that the potential trade-offs between efficiency and equity outcomes need to be better articulated before one can confidently conclude that they could have done better in targeting the poor and hence should change the way future strategies and priorities are articulated. The major difficulty appears to be the complexity of the transmission of the gains and losses from agricultural R &amp; D to the various actors, which makes it a challenge to confidently predict the outcomes on the poor of alternative choices.</p>

The authors note that the agri-clinics fill an important need of farmers by providing agricultural inputs and that they are becoming a key information source for farmers as well. However, farmers’ awareness of and demand for the soil testing service is low. Given that the agri-clinic programme is a private form of advisory services; its success depends, among other things, on farmers’ willingness to pay for soil testing services. Farmers who have tested their soil and followed the advice of the soil testing service provider are willing to pay more for the service. The paper also explores the extent to which certain extension services can or should be privatized in India.</p>

The conference focused on the following themes:


Sustainable intensification and climate-smart solutions – enhancing food production while reducing greenhouse gas emissions;

Overcoming the barriers to climate-smart agriculture;

Managing volatility and risks – technical and social-economic options for climate-smart risk management.


The global science conference in Wageningen is a follow-up to the Global Conference on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change, hosted by the Netherlands in 2010, that concluded that agriculture (including forestry and fisheries) must be part of the solution to climate change.Download <a href="http://knowledge.cta.int/en/content/download/27804/360196/file/The+Wageningen+Statement++26-10+14+17+(FINAL).pdf" target="_blank">the statement</a> and <a href="http://knowledge.cta.int/en/content/download/27805/360209/file/Wageningen+Media+Statement10+26+11.pdf" target="_blank">the press release</a>.</p>

					<p><i>IIED Reflect and Act Briefing; July 2011</i>This <a href="http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/G03126.pdf" target="_blank">briefing</a> reflects on IIED's Regoverning Markets project, which looked at how the 'supermarket revolution' was affecting poor producers. It showcases how public and private actors can use policy and innovative business models to ensure modernisation includes smallholders. The objective of the Regoverning Markets project was to support policies and practices on agrifood market modernisation that are inclusive of small-scale producers, by generating evidence and facilitating policy dialogues. Key findings show that small-scale farmers are often unaffected by modernisation of food markets, because flexible wholesalers mediate the changes: this changes as food safety and traceability become top priorities. Also, integrating small producers requires organised farmers and pertinent public and private policies. Moreover, it found that companies with inclusive business models are keystones for pro-poor development – as are ‘bridging partners’ who act to match farm produce with customer demands. This briefing thus reflects on IIED’s farm-to-market project and its possible contribution to future development to alleviate rural poverty.</p>

					<p><i>C. Laroche Dupraz and A. Postolle; International Congress European Association of Agricultural Economists (EAAE); 2011</i>This <a href="http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/114402/2/Laroche%20Dupraz_Catherine_318.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> questions the possibility for West African states to reach food sovereignty given their various trade commitments and other external constraints. The starting hypothesis is that the concept of food sovereignty could be a political tool and provide economic instruments to boost the protection of agriculture in developing countries. The particularity of the approach used in the study is to combine historical economic analysis with political approach (in term of strategy, confrontation and objectives of public policy actors) to food sovereignty and trade commitments. Firstly, the authors ascertain that there is a huge gap between food sovereignty discourse and instrumentation and reality of agrarian protection and support in developing countries in general and more specifically in Western Africa. The second part focuses on the international binding commitments to test the reality of an antagonism between a neoliberal view of globalisation, carried out by the GATT/WTO system, and an alternative in favour of food sovereignty, by analysing recent negotiations, at WTO and with EPA, as well as to IMF structural adjustments conditions. The last part of the paper studies the internal constraints (such as the persistence of an “urban bias” against rural realities, the complex technicality of WTO exemption requests) and dynamics (talks of a common agricultural policy in the region, encouraging trends towards regional integration) related to the development of food sovereignty policy in West Africa.</p>

					<p><i>Report by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Pacific Studies Series, September 2011</i>This <a href="http://beta.adb.org/sites/default/files/climate-change-food-security.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> produced by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) describes the present state of food security and its contributing factors in the Pacific region, assesses its prospects amid the growing threats and likely impacts of climate change, and presents potential areas for more active assistance, investments, and interventions from ADB and other development partners. While technical and policy measures to ensure food security amid the ensuing climate change are numerous, interrelated, and complex, the successful implementation of programs and projects calls for simple and flexible designs that carefully consider the capabilities of relevant stakeholders at the regional, national, and local levels. The Pacific island governments view climate change as a priority issue, especially in terms of its potential impacts on food security, and need clear directions in addressing both issues.

					<p>The latest (June 2011) <a href="http://www.prolinnova.net/sites/default/files/documents/thematic_pages/climate_change_pid/2011/prolinnova_policy_brief_climate_change_june_2011_lowres.pdf" target="_blank">policy brief</a> from Prolinnova reports on the organisation’s investigative work on how poor rural communities develop innovations that enables a stronger resilience to changes in climates patterns. This brief focuses on community-based adaptation to climate change, and the means needed to recognize and document local innovation. A number of example from the field help illustrate Prolinnova’s research (<a href="http://www.prolinnova.net/sites/default/files/documents/thematic_pages/climate_change_pid/2009/073237%20Summary%20Prolinnova%20working%20paper%20on%20Climate%20Change%20080609.pdf" target="_blank">2008</a> – <a href="http://www.prolinnova.net/~prolin/sites/default/files/documents/thematic_pages/climate_change_pid/2009/073237%20Prolinnova%20working%20paper%20on%20Climate%20Change%20100209.pdf" target="_blank">2011</a>) into the innovation and creativity processes appearing in local communities that face uncertainty and hardship due to climate-related environmental change. At a moment in time where food security and climate change are at the top of the agenda, Prolinnova has made three detailed recommendations to help policy makers integrate local innovation in the climate sensitive agricultural programmes they are currently developing: 


Give local innovation due recognition in policy and planning,

Promote farmer led adaptation to climate change, and

Link Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) to local governance and innovation.

					<p><i>G. Porto, N. D. Chauvin and M. Olarreaga; World Bank; 2011</i>The focus of this <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTRANETTRADE/Resources/Supply_Chains.pdf" target="_blank">book</a> is on a neglected source of 'real costs' for farmers in low-income countries: market power along the supply chain. The authors argue that the exercise of market power along the supply chain will have a number of possible effects. Given that the impacts on prices will imply a redistribution of income across agents in the economy, there will also be implications for poverty and the attainment of poverty reduction objectives. The analysis shows that the effects of market power on income distribution and the incomes of poor households can be significant. It also demonstrates that there is much heterogeneity, both across countries for a given crop, and within a country for different crops. Measures to increase competition – to make the market structure less concentrated – will have effects similar to those resulting from actions to reduce customs clearance times, facilitate the movement of goods across borders, and so forth. The latter are issues that are at the forefront of the policy agenda in many countries and the activities of development agencies. The analysis is not only an interesting exercise but it is of great policy significance as it suggests that more attention should be devoted to competition policy in low-income countries. </p>
