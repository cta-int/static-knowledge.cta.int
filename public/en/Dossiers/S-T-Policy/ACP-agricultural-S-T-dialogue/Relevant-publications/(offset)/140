						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

Hook; Thomson Reuters<b>Publisher:</b> Reuters, 2010 This report provides an introduction to patterns of research activity in Africa. Its overall finding is that, whilst the volume of research activity on the continent as a whole remains small, individual countries are making notable and effective contributions of a high standard.The challenges that Africa faces are enormous and indigenous research could help provide both effective and focused responses. This research finds little correlation between the amount and range of resources a country has at its disposal and the standard and volume of its research contributions. For example Malawi, with one-tenth the annual research output of Nigeria, produces research of a quality that exceeds the world average benchmark while Nigeria hovers around half that impact level.</p>

	This multimedia book reports on an initiative in West Africa that seeks to create safe spaces in which food providers and consumers can discuss how to build an agri-food research system that is democratic and accountable to wider society. An explicit aim of the entire process is to strengthen the voices and effectiveness of small-scale producers and other citizens in the governance of agricultural research as well as in setting strategic research priorities and validating knowledge. The book combines text, photos, video and audio recordings to describe the methodologies used in processes of deliberation and inclusion that involved small scale producers (farmers, pastoralists, fishermen and food processors) and holders of specialist knowledge on agricultural research. This multimedia publication is available online and will be printed as a hardcopy book in early 2011.</p>

The main conclusions highlight the fact that the agriculture of tomorrow will require greater investments in: a) research on and technologies that make more efficient use of water, and environmentally more sustainable production systems; b) restoration of agrobiodiversity, local production systems and traditional knowledge, and food products to help diversify diets; c) promotion of healthier food habits and development of production systems and products with a reduced environmental impact (e.g., in terms of water and energy requirements and generation of greenhouse gases); and d) financial and non-financial mechanisms for the management of risks related to markets and climate change.</p>

					<p>The continued crisis is likely to put a damper on commodity prices for the near future. However, the medium term projections are still upbeat, with prices expected to remain well above pre-2007 peaks. On average OECD-FAO projects that nominal prices for all sectors will be 15-60% above the levels of the decade before the 2007-08 peaks. FAPRI also expects prices to remain strong over the projection period, though they are less bullish than OECD FAO about dairy prices. Agriculture is expected to cope better than other sectors with the economic crisis due to the relatively low income elasticity for food, at least in developed countries. However, the question of food security in developing countries remains a concern. Although not immune to the current economic malaise, developing countries are projected to remain the main source of growth in world demand and trade once economic growth resumes. FAPRI expects the biggest increase in grain and oilseeds demand to be in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, driven by population growth, the expansion of livestock production and increased demand for biofuel feedstocks. Except for wheat and coarse grains, production is also increasingly shifting away from developed countries to emerging and middle income developing countries.Authors: OECD and FAO, July 2009</p>

	By Eds. Anuradha Mittal with Melissa Moore, Oakland Institute, 2009. Promotional campaigns for a Green Revolution regularly feature a handful of African spokespeople like Florence Wambugu, a Monsanto-trained biotechnician, or Ruth Oniang’o, external advisor to the Gates Foundation. In the mainstream media, their voices calling for technology to save Africa drown out the genuine voices of farmers, researchers, and civil society groups, and these spokespeople build support for efforts such as AGRA. But there is widespread questioning of and opposition to technology-based solutions to hunger and poverty, especially genetic engineering.<b>Voices from Africa is a compilation of views, essays, and statements by the leading voices of African opposition to genetic engineering and tells the stories of their struggles. </b></p>

					<p>By Lamissa Diakité, Amadou Sidibé, Melinda Smaleand, Mikkel Grum, IFPRI Discussion Paper 2008. This paper reviews the structure and performance of the sorghum and millet seed sector in Mali. The Sahel is the origin of pearl millet and sorghum, seed selection and management of these crops is embedded in local cultures, and most producers of these crops are subsistence oriented. Despite seed sector reform, no certified seed of these crops is sold in local markets and farmers prefer to rely on themselves or each other for seed. The dominant source of certified seed is the national seed service. Certified seed is multiplied by contracted farmers and seed producer groups, and supplied to farmers through farmers’ associations, development organizations, and extension services. The informal sector supplies farmers with non-certified seed directly and indirectly through village grain markets. </p>

Odi, Briefing Paper 41, September 2008. The latest World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiation round, launched in November 2001 in Doha, was seen as a positive response to the terrorist attacks on the USA. The negotiations, known as the ‘Development Round’, had the ultimate objectives of reducing poverty and promoting development. Seven years later, the outlook is bleak. The Doha talks were suspended in July 2008, with trade negotiators increasingly lacking support from their governments. Future elections and rising food and energy prices have exacerbated protectionist tendencies and shifted the focus from international develop¬ment to self-interest. There are serious concerns as to whether talks can be revived.It is often argued that the success of Doha would only benefit big developing countries such as Brazil, China or India, while African countries and, in particular, smallholder farm¬ers, would lose. This argument assumes that African countries lack the capacity to benefit from broad tariff cuts on the export side and would become more vulnerable on the import side if tariffs were reduced still further. However, the caveat ‘the devil is in the detail’ is nowhere more appropriate than in trade negotiations. Without knowing whether Doha will finally succeed and, if so, what a compromise would look like, we cannot finally determine who will win, and who will lose. </p>

					<p>
By Valdete Berisha-Krasniqi et al., IFPRI Briefing Note, July 2008. The benefits least developed countries (LDCs) can draw from a multilateral trade reform as designed by the modalities made public in May 2008 are negligible, and some countries will even face adverse effects. World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiators should make a supplementary effort in favor of the poorest countries. The Duty-Free Quota-Free (DFQF) Initiative moves in the right direction, but it should be extended not only from a product point of view—with a 100, not 97, percent application—but also in terms of geographic coverage. This initiative has to be supported by both Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) and BrIC (Brazil, India, and China) countries. It is in the interests of Asian LDCs to prioritize full openness of OECD markets (a 100-percent DFQF regime) and full access to the U.S. market in particular, while African countries will draw more benefits from a geographic extension of this regime to BrIC countries.</p>

					<p>
By Jamie Morrison et al., Economic and Social Perspectives Policy Brief 1, July 2008. The prices of many staple food commodities have increased substantially over the past year. As a result, many developing countries are facing larger food import bills. The cereal import bill of the world’s poorest countries is forecast to rise by 56 percent in 2007/08, following an already significant increase of 37 percent in 2006/07. Given the growing dependency of many developing countries on imported food commodities and on foreign aid, as well as their generally high levels of debt, increasing food prices have important implications for growth and development. At the micro level, poor households in both food importing and food exporting countries are exceptionally vulnerable to increases in food prices, given the large share of food in total expenditure and the constraints they face in terms of low income and capital endowment. On the other hand, higher global food prices present an opportunity for agriculture. </p>

WBCSD, July 2008. This new report published by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and IUCN presents details of trends in agricultural production and consumption to help governments, farmers, consumers and industry better understand the challenges facing the sustainable management of agricultural ecosystems, such as meeting demands from a fast-growing world population, adapting to climate change impacts, and managing the natural resources of an increasingly depleted planet. On climate change, the report notes that while agriculture is directly affected by changing temperatures, rainfall and the spread of invasive species, it is also a major source of greenhouse gas emissions originating from fertilizer use, livestock and wetland rice production, burning of agricultural residues, or conversion of long-term grassland. According to the report, the challenge is thus ‘to adapt agriculture fast enough to a changing climate, and to shift production practices to reduce and preferably mitigate the carbon footprint of the food production system.’</p>

					<p> David Dickson, 2008. In “demand-driven” research, potential users of research are in the driving seat. An evaluation of Dutch-funded research programmes in developing countries raises questions about the concept of local &quot;ownership&quot;. It highlights several projects where having potential users of research results in the driving seat undoubtedly had a beneficial effect. Projects in Bolivia, South Africa and Tanzania, for example, proved to be highly successful, notably because they included a strong focus on research capacity building. But the evaluation also identifies cases where projects failed. Understanding the reasons for this failure provides important indicators to the components of success.</p>

The complex causes of the current food and agriculture crisis require a comprehensive response. In view of the urgency of assisting people and countries in need, the first set of policy actions—an emergency package—consists of steps that can yield immediate impact. Investment in these actions calls for additional resources. Policymakers should consider mobilizing resources from four sources: the winners from the commodity boom among countries; the community of traditional and new donor countries; direct or indirect progressive taxation and reallocation of public expenditures in the affected countries themselves; and mobilization of private sector finance, including through improved outreach of banking to agriculture. Global and national action is needed, through existing mechanisms, well-coordinated special initiatives, and possibly a special fund.</p>

	The Joint Africa-EU Strategy, adopted in Lisbon in December 2007, provides a long-term vision for a strategic partnership between Africa and the European Union. The EC is supporting Agricultural Research for Development (ARD) as part of its EU Development and Research policies. The 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technology – Food Agriculture and Biotechnologies (FP7-FAB) and the Food Security Thematic Programme (FSTP) are the two main instruments contributing to the support of ARD at the global, continental and sub-regional level. As such, the EC has facilitated a consultation between European and African ARD experts, organized by the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA) and the European Forum on Agricultural Research for Development (EFARD), making use of their existing Platform for African – European Partnership on Agricultural Research for Development (PAEPARD). The workshop was supported and facilitated by CTA. The general objective of the consultation was to establish priority areas of cooperation to increase the impact of agricultural research and knowledge systems on rural productivity, poverty reduction, food security and sustainable management of natural resources. More specifically, it was to identify targeted research topics and activities, taking into account the 10 broad priority areas to be funded in 2009 and beyond by FP7-FAB and the FSTP global non-CGIAR components in order to assure coherence, complementarily and synergy among the two programmes.</p>

					<p> Facilitated learning in soil fertility management: assessing potentials of low-external-input technologies in east African farming systems  The facilitated learning process of farm households and district policy-makers in addressing the problem of soil exhaustion is described. The process is applied in a case study in 4 districts in Kenya and Uganda during the period 1997 1999, where the potentials of low-external input agriculture (LEIA) practices in addressing the soil exhaustion problem were assessed. Working through an inclusive process of dialogue, observation, diagnosis, experimentation and exposure to different types of knowledge, participants made a thorough analysis of the current soil fertility situation and tested various LEIA options for improving soil fertility management. In all 4 research sites the future agricultural productivity is threatened by soil nutrient depletion. Maximal use of locally available nutrients through LEIA practices, combined with optimal use of external nutrients would be the most appropriate strategy. Long-term and intensive collaboration between research institutions on the one hand and extension services, non-governmental and community-based organizations on the other is needed for a successful and sustainable implementation of a facilitated learning approach. Involvement of stakeholders in the various stages of the research process, including the planning and project formulation is essential for an effective follow-up and implementation of the results.

					<p> The World Bank sought the assistance of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in evaluating how farming systems might change and adapt over the next thirty years and prepare a supporting study with the following objective: <i>'On the basis of a determination of the principal trends and issues affecting major farming systems in each World Bank region over the next 30 years, propose operational strategies, approaches and technologies that will contribute to significant and sustainable rural development and poverty reduction among farming system participants.'</i>  The results of the study are summarized in a set of seven documents, comprising six regional reports and the global overview contained in this volume. This document, which synthesises the results of the six regional analyses as well as discussing global trends, cross-cutting issues and possible implementation modalities, presents an overview of the complete study. This document is supplemented by two case study reports of development issues of importance to farming systems globally. The concept of Farming Systems is described in the introduction - where farming systems are defined as populations of farms that have broadly similar resource bases, enterprise patterns, household livelihoods and constraints, and for which similar development strategies and interventions would be appropriate. The biophysical, economic and human elements of a farm are interdependent, and thus farms can be analysed as systems from various points of view. Chapters 3-8 provide an overview off the characteristics of the major regional farming systems, regional strategic priorities and maps are given for the sub-Saharan, the Middle East and North Africa, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, South Asia, East Asia and Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean regions. Chapter 9 tackles issues like the challenge of contrasting farm characteristics, global challenges and priorities for the coming decades: achieving sustainable and productive use of natural resources, deploying science and technology, exploiting globalisation and market development, refocusing policies, institutions and public goods, and enhancing agricultural information and human capital. Chapter 10 deals with some operational implications and discusses topics like: demand-driven approaches to integrated rural development, support services and related institutions, financing instruments and assessing impact using farming systems frameworks. <a href="http://www.fao.org/ag/magazine/GFSS.pdf" target="_blank">Global Farming Systems Study: Challenges and Priorities to 2030 - Synthesis And Global Overview</a> </p>

					<p> How to reduce hunger and poverty, improve rural livelihoods, and facilitate equitable, environmentally, socially and economically sustainable development through the generation, access to, and use of agricultural knowledge, science and technology? 
The goal is to provide decision makers with the information they need to reduce hunger and poverty, improve rural livelihoods, and facilitate equitable, environmentally, socially and economically sustainable development through the generation, access to, and use of agricultural knowledge, science and technology. The Assessment would take interlinked short, medium and long-term perspectives(up to 2050) and use a multi-disciplinary approach to address the full range of agricultural products (crops, livestock, fisheries, forests, fiber, and biomass) and services. It would assess the economic, environmental, health and social (including gender) implications of current and potential future technologies. It would assess what can be learnt from the past by providing a critical retrospective of agricultural science and technology and the effectiveness of institutional arrangements, as well as focus on critical areas identified during the consultative process in relation to a plausible range of future scenarios. They include issues within the domain of global public goods that require international collaboration and discussion and issues characterized by rapidly changing contexts. The Assessment would be multi-scale, addressing global and sub-global (community to regional) issues. The global Assessment would address issues with broad relevance and would be interlinked with the sub-global (community to regional) Assessments. These sub-global Assessments, which would vary in scale from the continental to community level, would use a consistent methodology, cover a range of agro-ecological systems, and employ selection criteria that would take into account socio-economic and institutional conditions, and poverty mapping.  <a href="http://www.farmingsolutions.org/pdfdb/finalreport.pdf" target="_blank">An assessment of agricultural science and technology for development</a> </p>

					<p> This paper draws on experiences from eastern and southern Africa and from other developing countries. By using selected examples, an attempt is made to demonstrate that policies and politics have an effect on smallholder farmer’s agricultural growth. Policies need to be harmonized at local, national, regional, and global levels to benefit smallholder farmers. However, good policies alone will not necessarily create the desired impact, unless those policies are supported by political commitment in terms of financial resources and prioritized programs. Their implementation should also be closely monitored and evaluated to take corrective measures when needed to achieve the intended goals. Broad stakeholder participation, sufficient local implementing capacity, and effective coordination and accountability are vital for the successful implementation of policies that promote the smallholder farmer-led agricultural sector (taken from the introduction). <a href="http://www.ifpri.org/events/seminars/2005/smallfarms/sfproc/SO7_Kisamba-Mugerwa.pdf" target="_blank">The Politics of and Policies for Smallholder Agriculture</a> </p>

					<p> This paper addresses four questions, often treated separately, but necessarily linked. Each question is complex, and space is limited.  1. Given the high and usually rising share of farmland in small farms in most poor countries, and the evidence on how output per hectare varies with farm size, when and where is development based on small farms conducive to mass poverty reduction, and with what implications for the audience on which farm science should focus?;  2. Given what we know about how farms become and stay efficient, competitive, and poverty-reducing, what type of technical progress helps them do so—and is any type harmful?;  3. How can research lead to more of the 'helpful' technical progress and less of the 'harmful' sort—or, to disaggregate the question, what kind of research might improve smallholder access, or returns, to key inputs (water, seeds, fertilizer, and pest management)? If policy analysts know that, it helps them to decide what incentives, and to whom, will get appropriate research done.  4. Do the answers to the last two questions depend on changing global market requirements? In particular, can technical progress 'for small farms'—so far largely about production—respond to, or keep pace with, post-harvest changes (e.g., the rise of supermarkets) that challenge the foundation of small and family farms’ competitiveness: relatively low unit transaction costs of labor? (taken from the introduction). <a href="http://www.ifpri.org/events/seminars/2005/smallfarms/sfproc/SO5_Lipton.pdf" target="_blank">From policy aims and small-farm characteristics to farm science needs</a> </p>
