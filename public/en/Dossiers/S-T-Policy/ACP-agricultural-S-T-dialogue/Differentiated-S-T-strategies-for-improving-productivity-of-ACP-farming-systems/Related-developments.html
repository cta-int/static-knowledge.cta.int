						<dt><a href="../Demanding-Innovation.html">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="../Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems.html">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p>Inserting rows of ‘fertilizer trees’ into maize fields can help farmers cope with the impacts of drought and degraded soils, according to a 12-year-long study by researchers at the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF). They conducted three coordinated experiments, starting in 1991 in Malawi and Zambia, and found that farms that mix nitrogen-fixing trees and maize have consistent and relatively high yields year after year. In Malawi, the highest average maize yield was found in fields that combined both fertilizer trees and inorganic fertilizers, but applied at just half the standard recommended amounts.Maize mono-crops grown with inorganic fertilizers may have higher yield in some years but the yield is less reliable in the long run. Mono-cropping without replenishing soil nutrients in any way – the <i>de facto</i> practice of resource-poor maize farmers – was the least productive and most unpredictable of all.EurekAlert has the <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-10/bc-rsl101112.php" target="_blank">report</a> (14/10/2012).<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-10/bc-rsl101112.php" target="_self">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-10/bc-rsl101112.php</a></p>

					<p>SciDev.net reports on a recent pilot aquaponics experiment underway in the Cook Islands. The project combines aquaculture (raising aquatic animals like fish in tanks) and hydroponics (cultivating plants in water) in symbiosis, a strategy that can be replicated in other island nations. The project's long-term objective is to give Pacific islanders – who are facing climate-related issues such as drought and fish poisoning – a way to sustainably grow crops using minimal water and no pesticides.This aquaponics project is a great example of successful partnership: it is the brainchild of Pacific Islands Trade and Invest, the business arm of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, which has teamed up with the New Zealand and Cook Islands governments to make it happen.(SciDev.net, 26/10/2012)<a href="http://www.scidev.net/en/agriculture-and-environment/farming-practices/news/cook-islanders-grow-sustainable-food-using-aquaponics-.html" target="_self">http://www.scidev.net/en/agriculture-and-environment/farming-practices/news/cook-islanders-grow-sustainable-food-using-aquaponics-.html</a></p>

					<p>Apple thinning has been a major problem for farmers seeking to transition from conventional to organic production. Consumers expect organic apples to have comparable size and quality to non-organic fruit, and thinning is needed to achieve that goal. Organic farmers are not able to use most plant hormones and instead rely on time-consuming and expensive hand labour to thin their trees. In Europe, organic farmers also use mechanical methods, as well as lime-sulphur and molasses. These other methods are not as effective as hand thinning and can damage trees. Now, scientists at the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) have found a way to thin trees using an ingredient commonly found in kitchens.By applying potassium bicarbonate, a substance used in baking, to trees at a key times in the growing season, organic farmers can efficiently regulate crop load better than hand thinning and the other alternatives currently used in organic production. The results were consistent for 11 varieties treated over a three year period. Potassium bicarbonate has the advantage of being very environmentally friendly. In 2012, Swiss authorities approved the commercial product, Armicarb©, for use as an apple thinner based on FiBL’s research.(Excerpt from <a href="http://www.fibl.org/nc/en/service-en/news-archive/news/article/apple-thinning-with-potassium-bicarbonate.html" target="_blank">FiBL News Service</a>, 20/8/2012)</p>

					<p>Ongoing research by the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Kampala, Uganda, in collaboration with other CGIAR centres (CIAT, ICRAF, and CIFOR), has attempted to evaluate the benefits of different types of systems, including co-benefits for climate change adaptation and mitigation and implications for pest and disease incidence. Researchers have found that banana-coffee intercrop systems can be beneficial for farmers because they leave the yield of the coffee crop virtually untouched, while providing more food for their personal use. Essentially, by combining the two crops farmers are greatly increasing the total yield value of a single plot of land, even if the yield for individual crops doesn’t change much.(CCAFS, 9/7/2012)<a href="http://ccafs.cgiar.org/blog/uganda-coffee-and-banana-go-better-together" target="_blank">http://ccafs.cgiar.org/blog/uganda-coffee-and-banana-go-better-together</a></p>

					<p>ILRI Clippings looks at why many small scale farmers do not adopt no-till practices (understood as conservation agriculture) on their land. It appears that the value of crop ‘wastes’– what remains of cereal and legume crops after their grains and pods have been harvested for human consumption – is invaluable for poor farmers raising farm animals as well as growing food crops. More so, the authors of the featured story say that ‘No-till requires farmers to keep stubble on the field after each harvest, so that it adds organic matter to the soil. But farmers in developing countries usually raise livestock in addition to cultivating crops, and stubble is an important source of livestock feed. The need to use the stubble for feed is particularly strong for small and isolated farmers without good alternatives.’ Adding that ‘Efforts to disseminate no-till and other technologies to small farmers in developing countries should therefore focus on identifying and alleviating the constraints that result in crop stubble being so valuable as feed to these farmers. Otherwise the cost of no-till adoption of no-till technology may simply be too high.’(ILRI Clippings, 21/8/2012)<a href="http://ilriclippings.wordpress.com/2012/08/21/stuck-on-stubble-why-no-till-agriculture-is-a-no-can-do-on-many-small-farms" target="_blank">http://ilriclippings.wordpress.com/2012/08/21/stuck-on-stubble-why-no-till-agriculture-is-a-no-can-do-on-many-small-farms</a></p>

					<p>During the 2nd African Organic Conference held in Lusaka, Zambia 2-4 May 2012 on the theme ‘Mainstreaming Organic Agriculture in the African Development Agenda’ participants agreed that organic agriculture is becoming a key component of sustainable development. Research has shown that the adoption of organic agriculture practices significantly increases yields and food security and makes producers less vulnerable to international input price volatility, and promotes environmental sustainability, among other benefits. In this regard, a declaration adopted at the conference welcomed the institutionalisation of AfroNet (African Organic Network), the umbrella organisation uniting and representing African organic stakeholders. The declaration calls upon the African Union to mainstream organic agriculture into all areas of its work, including the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP).(Excerpt from ICTSD, 13/6/2012)News: <a href="http://ictsd.org/i/agriculture/135315/" target="_self">http://ictsd.org/i/agriculture/135315/</a>Declaration: <a href="http://unctad.org/meetings/en/SessionalDocuments/ditc_tedb_ted0041_en.pdf" target="_self">http://unctad.org/meetings/en/SessionalDocuments/ditc_tedb_ted0041_en.pdf</a></p>

					<p>by recent agronomic research. Christian Dupraz, a researcher at the National Institute for Agronomic Research (INRA) in Montpellier, has been studying this type of mixed farming for the past 20 years. He believes in the importance of switching to ‘agro-ecological’ systems that do not depend on the petrochemical industry. ‘The fertility of French land is due to its forests, which have enriched it with carbon. Planting trees can replace chemical fertilisers’, he said.(The Guardian, 21/8/2012)<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/21/agroforestry-france-farming-revival" target="_blank">http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/21/agroforestry-france-farming-revival</a></p>

Farms rely on birds for pollination, fruit dispersal and pest control and the presence of intact, biodiverse lands near a farm guarantees society certain natural benefits, including water purification and nutrient cycling. Costa Rica is already one of the first nations to adopt a ‘payments for ecosystem services’ (PES) scheme. Acknowledging the value of keeping undeveloped land near agricultural areas, the policy compensates farmers for leaving part of their lands out of production. The paper’s new finding offers further support for the practice.(<a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/june/farming-biodiversity-coexist-062212.html" target="_blank">Stanford News Service</a>, 22/6/2012)</p>

					<p>The poorest societies may be more able to adapt to the threat climate change poses to food supplies than their slightly richer peers, a new study suggests. We might assume getting richer would always make a country safer from drought and famine, but that turns out not to be the case. Instead, the very poorest countries seem to become more vulnerable in the early stages of a transition to modern agriculture. There's a crucial period before the benefits of modernisation start to kick in, during which they are more vulnerable to problems like drought than when they started. For example, switching from pastoral farming to settled agriculture can bring benefits to local people in the long-term, once they can introduce new techniques like higher-yielding, drought-resistant crops and modern machinery. But these need investment to work, and it takes time for poor farmers to build up the necessary capital. In the meantime, most land has been parcelled up into private plots and is now crisscrossed by fences, so people can no longer respond to drought as their pastoralist ancestors would have - by simply moving their herds somewhere with more water.

					<p>According to a study by the German Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (BiK-F), the value derived from the savannah amounts to 39% of the average annual income of a rural household in northern Benin. The authors also found that poorer households are more dependent on savannah biodiversity than wealthier ones. The Convention on Biological Diversity of the United Nations (CBD) and most recently the TEEB (‘The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity’) study have shown that the amount of economic contribution nature and environment make to society can be measured. Scientists from the German Biodiversity and Research Centre have now analysed the value of the savannah in northern Benin and determined how much income is generated by the exploitation of non-timber forest products in the region.

	Kenyan rice farmers are switching to the System for Rice Intensification (SRI) developed by the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Kenya. SRI is expected to improve production by more than 50 % while reducing water use by about 25 % to 50 % (allowing for the saved water to be used to expand the production area). Farmers will use only 25 % of seeds used in the conventional paddy system and save on input costs. One of the disadvantages of the new system, however, is that it requires more weeding since weeds tend to grow more rapidly under un-flooded conditions. The extra effort is compensated by increased yields of one to two tonnes per hectare.

					<p>Organic farming is more profitable and economically secure than conventional farming even over the long-term, according to a <a href="https://www.agronomy.org/news-media/releases/2011/0901/510/" target="_blank">new study</a> in <a href="https://www.agronomy.org/publications/aj/view/103-5/aj10-0371-pub.pdf" target="_blank">Agronomy Journal</a>. Using experimental farm plots, researcher T. A. Delbridge et al. at the University of Minnesota found that organic beat conventional even if organic price premiums (i.e. customers willing to pay more for organic) were to drop as much as 50 percent. Conducted over 18 years, the study found that a conventional farm, rotating corn, soy, oat, and alfalfa over 4 years brought in less than half of the revenues an organic farm netted.
