						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/en/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

					<p> Smallholder farming systems in Papua New Guinea are characterized by an integrated set of cash cropping and subsistence food cropping activities. In the Highlands provinces, the subsistence food crop subsystem is dominated by sweet potato production. Coffee dominates the cash cropping subsystem, but a limited number of food crops are also grown for cash sale. The dynamics between subsystems can influence the scope for complementarity between, and technical efficiency of their operations, especially in light of the seasonality of demand for household labour and management inputs within the farming system. Farm survey data collected in the Benabena district of the Eastern Highlands Province were used to derive technical efficiency indices for each household. A stochastic input distance function approach is used to establish whether diversification economies exist and whether specialization in coffee, subsistence food or cash food production influences the technical efficiency on the sampled farms. Diversification economies are weakly evident between subsistence food production and both coffee and cash food production, but diseconomies of diversification are discerned between coffee and cash food production. Significant technical efficiency gains are made from diversification among broad cropping enterprises (subsystems). From abstract Elsevier Science Journal.</p>

					<p> A comparative performance analysis was carried out of 45 orchards containing mango in Phrao at 80 km of Chiang Mai, northern Thailand, with the aim to identify land and management aspects that condition mango productivity. Tree counts revealed that mango trees made up 34, 42, and 23% of the orchards on hills, footslopes, and terraces, respectively. Log-linear relationships that quantify the contribution to the total yield gap for each yield constraint showed that yields increased if: (1) it was not an &quot;off&quot; year; (2) the orchard was situated on a hill or on soils with a relatively high pH or poor water holding capacity; (3) supplemental irrigation could be supplied; (4) weeding was carried out by tractor; (5) pruning was carried out; and (6) if pesticides were sprayed by motor sprayer, deep into the canopy. The model suggests that environmental factors (location and pH) accounted for about 30% of the yield gap, while management factors accounted for 49%, and the year effect for 21%. The log-linear behaviour of the yield data results in exponential yield increments for each partial yield gap closed. Hence, current production is not yet constrained by the law of diminishing returns and management of mango should strive for the highest level of technology available.

					<p> The importance of rice self-sufficiency in farming system evolution was studied, using data of household surveys conducted in 5 out of 6 districts of the Province of Bac Kan in northern Vietnam in 1999 and 2000. Statistical analysis was used to reveal the relationship between upland rice, crop-livestock interaction, and off-farm activities. It was found that the production strategies of the different households depended on their access to rice fields (mountains, valleys, and terraces) and on their level of self-sufficiency. When households lack lowland rice, they turn to the hillsides to grow upland rice, to raise cattle and pigs, and for off-farm activities to sustain their livelihoods. In contrast, households that are able to meet their lowland rice requirements diversify into cash crops and buffalo breeding. A classification of farming systems is suggested. The study was part of a wider effort to ensure that development interventions and appropriate technical and economic advice is targeted to the right type of farmers. From authors' summary.</p>

					<p> It is widely acknowledged that market access is a powerful tool to transform agriculture from subsistence to commercial enterprises. However, there is limited evidence to show the relationship between market access and agricultural performance. Whether countries respond in a similar manner to market stimulus remains unanswered. The results of empirical studies in 9 selected developing countries are used to give insight about the explicit influence of markets on agricultural productivity. Elasticities derived show that, specialization in most countries is higher than intensification by a large margin. This indicates potential for increasing agricultural output even without using expensive inputs and technology. The following countries were covered in the study: Benin, India, Kenya, Malawi, Myanmar, Niger, the Sudan, Tanzania and Thailand.</p>

					<p> Analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of resources and technological inputs on farm production (FP) in north-western China, including 5 provincial districts of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. The gross value of FP using 1978 constant prices was chosen to be the dependent variable in data analysis. Input variables included the irrigation ratio, farm labour, fertilizer application, and farm machinery. Multivariate statistical analysis (correlation and regression) was used to characterize the relationships between the gross value of FP and various input variables. The gross value of FP in the region increased 5-fold during the study period, and was strongly associated with resource use and technological inputs. The gross value of FP was correlated with the irrigation ratio in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia, where the irrigation ratio was relatively low compared with the national averages. The increase in irrigation ratio in these districts explained 9 19% of the growth in farm output from 1978 to 1998. Technological inputs of chemical fertilizer and farm machinery were associated with farming output in all provincial districts. During the study period, the application of technological inputs increased 2- to 8-fold, and contributed about 45% in the growth of farming output in the region. Labour input was found to be correlated with FP. From abstract Elsevier Science Journal. </p>

					<p> From 1998 to 2001, an evaluation study of a small tank irrigation system was carried out in Bhubaneshwar in Orissa, India, to examine the potential of rainwater harvesting in areas where canal and tubewell irrigation are not feasible for topographical, geological, and hydrological reasons. The system had a catchment area of 3 ha of cultivated terrace (slope 2-3%) and a command area of 0.95 ha. The tank capacity was 1469 m3. The tank was not lined as the seepage losses were around 2 mm/day, which is well within the critical limit of 6 mm/day. A rotational cropping system was adopted with transplanted rice, groundnut, mustard, and watermelon, while the embankment was planted with banana and papaya. The pond was stocked with Labeo rohita, Cirrhinus mrigal, Catla catl,, and Macrobrachium rosenbergii. It was found that the benefit-cost ratio of the field crop alone was 1.89, whereas it increased to 2.27 with horticultural crops on the embankment, and to 2.80 if fish culture is taken up. The benefit-cost ratio could be further increased to 3 by including duck rearing.</p>

					<p> Contour hedgerow intercropping system (alley cropping) has been promoted as a promising option for sustainable land management in many parts of the world. It was introduced into China in 1991 as a management option of sloping lands. Despite its effectiveness in soil conservation and soil fertility improvement, farmers' adoption had been unsatisfactory before 1998, mainly due to its lack of visible and direct income. Mulberry (Morus alba) is planted within 2 rows of hedgerows of N-fixing plants to increase economic benefits to Chinese farmers, and to fully use land resources and the rich soil nutrients under hedgerows. Compared to the mulberry conventionally planted on land risers, mulberry planted within hedgerows produces higher fresh and dry matter leaf biomass. The economic traits of the mulberry planted in hedgerows are superior to those of the mulberry planted on land riser. The innovation of incorporating mulberry trees in hedgerows helps solve the problems of land lost to hedgerows and lack of direct income, and initiates a new direction of use and management of the contour hedgerow intercropping system to achieve more benefits. Incorporation of mulberry trees into hedgerows has become the key factor for farmers' adoption of the technology in the project region. Study of other cash crops that can be incorporated into hedgerows is needed. From abstract Elsevier Science Journal.</p>

					<p> Many small farming communities in Latin America have modified their traditional cropping systems to incorporate non-traditional export crops (NTEC). The shift from subsistence to commercial agriculture is perceived by development agencies as an opportunity to alleviate poverty in rural areas. However, most small-scale farmers are not familiar with the production problems of NTEC, such as Bemisia tabaci and various geminiviruses transmitted by this whitefly species. In the absence of adequate technical assistance, due to drastic budgetary reductions in national agricultural research programmes, farmers have relied on agrochemicals to protect their NTEC. This situation has led to considerable pesticide abuse and rejection of contaminated produce in international markets. A study was conducted in the Valley of Monjas, located in the Jutiapa-Jalapa area of south-western Guatemala, to analyse some of the factors determining the adoption of NTEC and displacement of traditional food crops, and suggest possible measures to allow small farming communities to benefit from broad-based cropping systems that include both traditional and non-traditional food and cash crops.

					<p> Rice-based farming systems in Cambodia incorporate rainfed lowland rice, dry season rice in some cases, animal production (cattle, pigs, chickens and ducks), fishing (or fish culture) and other activities such as palm sugar production, vegetable production, wild food collection and trade. Because of the close interaction of these components, a change in any one of them can alter the whole system. The adoption of a modern rice variety (IR 66) in the early wet season of the rainfed lowland rice agro-ecosystem resulted from the interplay of many factors which provided the preconditions that favoured adoption of the new technology. Agricultural innovation was associated simultaneously with adoption (of a product of professional research) and adaptation (by farmers to fit local circumstances) so that emerging opportunities for change could be exploited. The key to this innovation process was experimentation by farmers using novel inputs. Innovation was thus a collaborative process involving sequential learning and social change.

					<p> The Iranian government encourages farmers to produce more wheat by increasing farm productivity and efficiency. A Cobb-Douglas frontier production function was used to develop a simple relationship between a farm-level output-based technical efficiency measure (the Timmer index) and an input-based measure (the Kopp index). For data collected from 164 farms in Kerman province, the average Timmer and Kopp indexes were estimated at 0.93 and 0.91, respectively, and were found to be similarly affected by farm size (positively up to about 9 ha) and by input ratios, though with rather small explanatory power. Thus, there seems some but limited scope to increase the profitability of Iranian wheat production either by increasing the volume of farm production, given the current input levels, or by decreasing inputs for the current level of wheat production. However, since wheat producers may be able to adapt their production process more easily and quickly by implementing new techniques (i.e. by a more efficient combination of inputs) than by adopting new technology, correction of input over-use can be regarded as a policy with speedy if limited effect in this case.

					<p> Risk-coping mechanisms of farmers in drought-prone areas of Asia are assessed, using the case of rainfed rice systems in eastern India. The nature of the drought problem in Asian rice systems is discussed and an analytical review of studies that have examined farmers' risk-coping mechanisms and their effectiveness is presented. The economic cost of drought in rainfed rice areas is assessed. Based on farm-level data from eastern India, the various mechanisms used by farmers are described. The drought-prone rice area in Asia is estimated at more than 23 million ha. A distinction is made between ex ante and ex post coping strategies. They include: (1) spatial diversification of fields; (2) crop diversification; (3) varietal diversification; (4) sharecropping; (5) temporal adjustments or vertical diversification; and (6) consumption smoothing and other household adjustments. Farmers in Orissa seem not to be able to manage risk as well as their counterparts in eastern Uttar Pradesh. This is probably related to differences in rural infrastructure and policies that encourage income diversification. Implications of the findings for the design of rice technology and institutional reforms are discussed.</p>

					<p> The possibility for the hydroponic culture of butterhead lettuce at a commercial scale in the tropics was examined in 3 seasons (spring, summer, and autumn), using 2 temperature regimes (25-30 °C or 30-35 °C) combined with 2 flow rates of nutrient solution (50 or 80 ml/min/m2). It was shown that the best plant growth was associated with the lower temperature regime. Higher water flow rate stimulated plant growth only in the summer growing period under the higher temperature regime, due to the larger amount of dissolved oxygen in the nutrient solution. Although the plant quality parameters and leaf colour remained unaffected under most of the temperature regimes and flow rates, they differed according to the seasons. In general, higher chlorophyll values and nitrate concentrations were observed in the spring and autumn, whereas lower chlorophyll and higher vitamin C concentrations were recorded in summer. The estimated cost of constructing a low-cost type of capillary hydroponic system (CHS) of 1000 m2 was about 660 000 yen in both Paraguay and Thailand, which corresponds to about one-third of the cost in Japan. It was concluded that the CHS system could be used for year-round, outdoor, commercial lettuce production in the tropics. From authors' summary.</p>

					<p> Over the last 50 years, the northern mountain region (NMR) of Vietnam, has suffered from a large loss of forest cover, often blamed on the swidden farming systems. Different programmes have been put forward to change local land use practices: to decrease the amount of swidden land, &quot;sedentarize&quot; farmers responsible for practising swidden agriculture, and introduce new farming systems. However, some researchers have identified one type of swidden farming system, composite swiddening, as ecologically more stable, causing little net deforestation and less environmental degradation than other farming systems in the NMR. Geographic data for 5 districts in the NMR within a GIS, combined with field checking, were used to characterize, identify and map the spatial distribution of the general farming system types, including composite swiddening, by commune for these districts. The results of the mapping indicate that there are few communes where a single farming system type is found. As these districts are spread over 5 provinces, the results reinforce the view that in Vietnam's NMR, farming system types vary down to below the commune level. A comparison was done of 2000 data to 1992 data for one district. Permanent agriculture farming systems of both lowland rice agriculture and permanent upland agriculture are replacing swiddening systems. From abstract Elsevier Science Journal.</p>

					<p> Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) software was used to compare maize cropping systems with and without crop residue retention (RT) in Jalisco, Mexico. Variables considered included crop production, soil surface runoff water, soil organic C, and soil organic N content. Gridded climate surfaces and a range of soil profile scenarios formed the basis of the regional input. Three levels of N application (0, 150, and 235 kg/ha) represented current agronomic practices. Simulation models for maize and fallow were run in sequence for 12 consecutive years. Soil water holding capacity and topography were found to affect benefits of RT much more than N management. Benefits to maize production from RT were found mainly in areas in the north-east of Jalisco and surrounding regions, where low precipitation limits maize yields. Reductions in soil surface runoff due to RT were most evident in high rainfall areas in the central-east of Jalisco and surrounding regions. Although the effect of soil loss is not accounted for in the model, areas of pronounced soil surface runoff reduction are hypothesized to be areas of productivity gain in the longer term. The assessment provided insight in the regional potential for and the soil and climate conditions under which successful introduction of RT in maize cropping systems may be achieved.

					<p> In the western hills of Nepal, the adoption of 15 improved technologies in agriculture, horticulture, livestock and forestry production was surveyed. Data are analysed and interpreted using uni- and multi-variate statistical methods to provide household adoption profiles and to identify important factors affecting adoption. Results are related to the findings of an extension impact study. Their implications for research and extension in hill farming systems and for conducting adoption and research impact studies with multiple-technologies are considered. Only 10% of households were multi-technology adopters (adopting 4 technologies) while 60% adopted 2 or less and 30% of households did not adopt any of the technologies. Across the technologies, trying a technology was the most constraining step in the adoption process with households who had not tried the technologies ranging from 25 to 70% of the sample. The level and distribution of adoption were influenced by extension input, by ethnicity and by household food self-sufficiency. There was a positive relationship between enhanced extension input to farming households and the wider beneficial impacts perceived by these households, as a result of the adoption of the technologies. Benefits were skewed towards a small proportion of households more favoured by extension input and household resource base. From abstract Elsevier Science Journal.</p>

					<p> Through a study in north-western Syria, an approach was developed to integrate the knowledge of both farmers and land resource experts to promote adoption of new land use systems. This was done by comparing a farmer-led land suitability assessment (FLSA) with an expert-led land suitability assessment (ELSA). The results of FLSA and ELSA were integrated in a geographical information system (GIS). The farmers compared the results of FLSA and ELSA and their input ELSA was upgraded to suit local circumstances. The farmers' knowledge provided a better understanding of the impact of microclimatic variations on crop productivity. This is an important bonus of the FLSA because detailed climatic data for long periods are rarely available in most rural communities. The FLSA procedure explained adequately the overriding weight of socio-economic constraints over biophysical opportunities. A constraint in the FLSA is that useful and interesting indigenous knowledge is often scarce. The GIS approach was instrumental in the correlation of indigenous and expert land units and in the farmers' validation of land suitability. The farmers highly appreciated the improved communication with the scientists. The better interaction with the farmers will eventually pay off when it comes to adoption of improved management recommendations. From abstract Elsevier Science Journal.</p>

					<p> Vulnerability in the semi-arid tropics (SAT) has been directly linked to the high incidence of rainfall-related production risks and persistent drought. The consequences of this can be severe in the Indian SAT because of the fragmented rural financial systems, incomplete insurance facilities, and the absence of futures price markets such as those that prevailed in the 1970s and 1980s. An in-depth study of farm household behaviour under risk was carried out, using data collected through household surveys and village-level studies conducted by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT). The risky environment of the SAT and the extent of vulnerability among farm households are examined. Evidence on vulnerability is provided and coping mechanisms involving income compensation and informal self-insurance are described. Crop management strategies (the most common ones being crop diversification and intercropping) applied during drought years have been shown to partially smoothen fluctuations in crop income. Evidence from village-level studies also shows the impact of public sector assistance in helping households adjust to sources of vulnerability including drought. Crop insurance has been described as a direct policy response to alleviate the extent of vulnerability.</p>

					<p> Procedures were designed for modelling the impact of agricultural technology adoption decisions on consumption and nutrition in a subsistence farming context. The method is based on expected direct utility maximization (EDUM) formulation and incorporates subsistence quantities for broad aggregates of protein, calories, and other consumption goods. The method is applied to a hillside farming system of southern Honduras where new sorghum cultivars and erosion control techniques are being introduced. The expected EDUM model allows the estimation of the effects of new technology on consumption and marketed surplus in situations where marginal values of products vary and are affected by consumption and production choices. The introduction of the new technologies in southern Honduras results in improved nutrition and substantial increases in marketed surplus. These effects are due to simultaneous changes in output and consumption patterns. This work extends the subject of household modelling to problems with risk, and thus complements prior work in both the integrated analysis of production and consumption decisions and stochastic decision analysis.

					<p> Sources of resource use inefficiency in cotton production in the cotton and wheat growing region of Pakistan's Punjab were identified, using a non-parametric method, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The DEA methodology was developed to study the relative technical and allocative efficiencies of individual farms which use similar inputs, produce the same product and operate under comparable circumstances. Many farms were found to be both technically and allocatively inefficient in cotton production. The DEA enabled a clear identification of both the extent and the sources of technical and allocative inefficiencies; however, both the interpretation of the farm-level results and the projection of these results to a higher level require care, given the technical nature of the agricultural production processes.

					<p> Data on area, production and yields of legumes in the Indo-Gangetic plains of Bangladesh, northern India, Nepal and Pakistan are presented, making use of geographical information systems (GIS) technology to display and analyse the output. Biotic, abiotic and socio-economic constraints in legume cultivation are examined and opportunities for their increased production in the region assessed. Legumes covered include chickpea, cowpea, faba bean, garden pea, grass pea, groundnut, horse gram, lentil, mung bean, pigeon pea, soybean and urd. Time trend data reveal declining trends for most major legumes in each country; however, there are some exceptions to this (e.g. lentil in Nepal, mung bean in Pakistan) and reasons for optimism that many of the declining trends can be reversed. A fundamental problem to overcome in significantly increasing legumes production is to change the prevailing perceptions of their status as subsistence crops and have them considered as commercial crops. This will require aggressive on-farm demonstration of the many seemingly viable technical options, mainly developed on research stations, to alleviate the major biotic and abiotic production constraints. This involves dissemination of improved varieties and of improved, low-cost and environmentally-friendly cultivation techniques. Government policies need to be changed as existing policies overwhelmingly favour cereal cultivation at the expense of legumes. </p>
