						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Demanding-Innovation">Demanding Innovation</a></dt><dd>Researchers in ACP countries are facing a growing range of challenges. They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>
						
												
						<dt><a href="/Dossiers/S-T-Policy/ACP-agricultural-S-T-dialogue/Differentiated-S-T-strategies-for-improving-productivity-of-ACP-farming-systems">Differentiated S&amp;T strategies for improving productivity of ACP farming systems</a></dt><dd>ACP farming systems are very diverse and the scientific community must be able to provide adequate responses to meet the varied needs of small subsistence farmers who make up the majority of the ACP farming community while simultaneously addressing the needs of the medium to large-scale farming enterprises to compete on price, quality, responsiveness to changing consumer demands and reliability in supply in all markets. Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	According to Wals <i>et al.</i> ‘continued globalization and digitalization are not only affecting how we think, what we know, who to believe and how we act, they also affect the role of education in society’. In this regard, they attempt to answer ‘what do we educate for in such a world when things change so fast and knowledge becomes obsolete before you know it?’ For example, Wageningen University started changing their identity by positioning themselves as <i>life science universities</i>, which aspire to contribute to a better world and improved quality of life.</p><p class=" text-justify">In this feature article, Wals and colleagues provide a brief review of some trends in Tertiary Agricultural Education (TAE) within Europe and examines the world-wide shift from <i>traditional transmissive</i> to <i>emerging transformative</i> development of more dynamic competencies in a real-world setting. They note that a number of new competencies are required including: interdisciplinary problem-solving, addressing multiple stakeholder interests, participatory approaches in innovation, interactive methods in conflict resolution, responsive actions regarding community needs, critical media literacy, and social responsibility in entrepreneurship, to name a few, along with those that still connect to specific content areas (e.g. animal science, plant science, environmental science and agro-technology).</p><p class=" text-justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;This overarching innovation taking place in tertiary agricultural education in Europe is referred to as Competence-based Education and Training (CBET). A synthesis of the requirements for new graduates as defined by the public and the related competencies that are considered relevant is presented. A case study of the ten-step re-design of the MSc curriculum in horticulture at the Jimma University Agricultural College (JUCAVM) in Ethiopia is showcased.</p><p class=" text-justify">Photo:&nbsp;&nbsp;Jimma University Agricultural College (JUCAVM); source:&nbsp;https://plus.google.com/107229457994018982305/photos?hl=en</p>

<i>We live in turbulent times, our world is changing at accelerating speed. Information is everywhere, but wisdom appears in short supply when trying to address key interrelated challenges of our time such as; runaway climate change, the loss of biodiversity, the depletion of natural resources, the on-going homogenization of culture, and rising inequity. Living in such times has implications for education and learning. </i><br/><i>&nbsp;(Wals and Corcoran, 2012)</i></p><a name="eztoc482759_1_3" id="eztoc482759_1_3"></a><h3><b>Introduction</b></h3><p>Borrowing from one of the latest books on education and learning in the context of sustainable development – <i>Learning for Sustainability in Times of Accelerating Change</i> (Wals &amp; Corcoran, 2012) – it can be observed that the speed of change, physically, socially and culturally, is accelerating. Continued globalization and digitalization are not only affecting how we think, what we know, who to believe, how we act, they also affect the role of education in society. Higher education, for instance, and the science it produces, is no longer the sole authority of truth, if ever it was. Rather, science oftentimes represents just another point of view or an opinion in the public debate of controversial and ambiguous issues such as; the causes and impacts of climate change, the role of GMOs in food security, the use of biofuels, etc. Scientists can be found on different ends of the ongoing debates, although more might be found at one end than on the other. It is not easy to decide who is right, who is wrong, or who is more right than others, or what the best way to move forward might be.</p><p>What do we educate for in such a world when things change so fast and knowledge becomes obsolete before you know it? How do we prepare today’s graduate for the world of tomorrow? And more specifically, what are the implications for tertiary agricultural education (TAE) around the world? We will respond to these questions by offering a brief review of some trends in TAE within Europe and zooming in on a world-wide response by shifting from traditional transmissive (based on the transfer of static knowledge from a sending teacher to a receiving learner) to emerging transformative (based on the development of more dynamic competencies in real-world settings based on authentic tasks and issues that require knowledge-in-action) forms of education which we will refer to as ‘competence-based’ (Mulder, 2012).[1]</p><p>Firstly, we need to observe that compared to ten years ago, TAE is more in demand today because of an increased interest in quality-of-life issues, including amongst young people. Issues such as climate change and related worldwide weather-related disasters, the end of peak oil and the search for alternatives, feeding the world and related food-security issues and emerging transitions towards a bio-based economy, circular economies, urban agriculture and sustainable consumption and production, have led to a more prominent place for TAE in the world of higher education. At the same time, agricultural universities started changing their identity by positioning themselves as <i>life science universities</i>, which aspire to contribute to a better world and improved quality of life. For example, Wageningen University does this by, among other things, publishing weekly front-page ‘infomercials’ in one of the Netherlands’ most prominent newspapers, showing how the university is dedicated to helping to solve societal problems regarding food security, the environment, landscape, health, community development in the South, etc. The enrolment figures of Wageningen University have increased almost 10 years in a row after a low point in the late 1990s. Draconian measures were taken during the years 1999-2003; complete programmes and about 25 chair groups were eliminated. But, this resulted in new and creative solutions for the tensions that were felt throughout the university, which is a good example of “innovation under pressure”.</p><a name="eztoc482759_1_4" id="eztoc482759_1_4"></a><h3><b>Innovation and development strategies in TAE in selected EU member states</b></h3><p>Clearly the new dynamic in our interlinked world and the new demands and needs that arise from the challenges of creating and supporting developments that are more sustainable than the ones currently employed, requires a number of new competencies. These include; interdisciplinary problem-solving, addressing multiple stakeholder interests, participatory approaches in innovation, interactive methods in conflict resolution, responsive actions regarding community needs, critical media literacy, and social responsibility in entrepreneurship, to name a few, along with those that still connect to specific content areas (e.g. animal science, plant science, environmental science and agro-technology).</p><p>How does TAE deal with these new demands? The results of a European review of competence needs and pertaining varieties of educational practices in life-science education provide some lessons (Mulder and Eernstman, 2006). Strategies of various institutes of TAE in Europe to develop new competencies were studied. Several universities (Austria – Universität für Bodenkultur Wien (BOKU); Czech Republic - Czech University of Life Sciences (CUL); Denmark – Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University (KVL); France - Institut supérieur d'agriculture Rhone-Alpes; Germany – Universität Hohenheim&nbsp; and Technische Universität München (TUM); Hungary – Corvenus; Ireland – University College Dublin; Poland – Warsaw Agricultural University (SGGW) and Agricultural University of Poznań; Romania – Agricultural Science University Bucharest; Spain – la Politécnica de Madrid; UK –&nbsp; Newcastle University) were either visited or contacted. A topic list was used during the interviews with the institutes. It is beyond the scope of this article to provide more details about the study and its limitations.</p><p>The most important findings regarding the expectations of the public and the educational innovations, as experienced by the interviewees, were synthesized. The most important focus points were selected, and information gaps were determined regarding competencies needed to respond to the observed demands and related pedagogical/didactical solutions. This led to a refined study description and a new questionnaire. Comparison between the various universities was not the main purpose of this study. The intention was to get a picture of challenges regarding public expectations with which TAE institutes were confronted, and how they responded in terms of competencies stressed and didactic/pedagogical strategies used for developing the competences needed. The results from the literature review and the interviews are presented below. The requirements are mentioned first, followed by the pertinent competencies.</p><table class="default" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%" summary="50">

In a recent issue of the <i>Journal of Agricultural Education &amp; Extension </i>Mulder (2012, p 319) writes: “The main reason for competence-based education is the alignment with needs in society, a sector, a region, a community or a company. CBET intends to give graduates access to the world of work. It also wants to enable them to have added value for the economy, and to ensure them a good livelihood in terms of self-employment, employment in commercial farms, processing companies, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), governmental agencies, or international donor organisations, or as independent entrepreneurs. The CBET movement is a response to education programmes that are obsolete and irrelevant for socio-economic development.” A matrix was developed by ECS staff members with these principles and levels of implementation. This matrix is primarily meant for competence-based agricultural vocational education, including higher professional education (see also: Mulder and Gulikers, 2011, 2012; Sturing <i>et al.</i> 2011ab). The principles are:</p>
<ol>

<li>The competencies, that are the basis for the study programme, are clearly specified.</li>

<li>Vocational core problems are the organizing unit for (re)designing the curriculum (learning and assessment).</li>

<li>Competence-development of students is assessed frequently (before, during and after the learning process).</li>

<li>Learning activities take place in several authentic situations.</li>

<li>In learning and assessment processes, knowledge, skills and attitudes are integrated.</li>

<li>Self-responsibility and (self)-reflection of students are stimulated.</li>

<li>Teachers both in school and practice fulfil their role as coach and expert in balance.</li>

<li>A basis is realized for a lifelong-learning attitude for students.</li>

New competencies are needed for graduates to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing world with diverse societal demands and tightening ecological boundaries. Educational institutes in Europe that were traditionally aimed at providing agricultural education have responded widely to new qualification needs (Mulder and Eernstman, 2006). There are also various ways, building on existing programmes, courses and in practical educational settings, to develop the new competencies needed, such as beta-gamma interaction, facilitating multiple stakeholder processes, participatory methods, interactive strategies, conflict resolution, responsiveness regarding community needs, and social responsibility.</p><p>Traditional educational innovation trajectories (based on needs assessment, curriculum design, instructional design, implementation and evaluation) are not sufficient to reorient TAE towards the direction needed within the prevailing global change dynamics. These trajectories take too long because of their inherent time lag of many years. Clear values regarding the content-related issues together with an appropriate educational philosophy are imperative.&nbsp;</p><p>[1] See, for a review of the literature on the concept of competence and of the current understanding of professional competence as situated expertise, Mulder (in press).
