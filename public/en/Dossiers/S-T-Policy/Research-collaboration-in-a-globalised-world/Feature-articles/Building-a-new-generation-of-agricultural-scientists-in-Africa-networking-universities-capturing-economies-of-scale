They are required to respond effectively to the demands of policy makers, private sector investors and donor agencies, farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food chain. They are being asked to deliver research outputs that will improve agricultural productivity, food quality and food safety, in order to increase their countries competitiveness in global markets, and contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development. At the same time, researchers must be socially and ethically responsible and contribute to the advancement of science and technology. As the demands for accountability increase and the levels of funding diminish, researchers need to prioritize and strategize their responses.</dd>

Therein lies the challenge as there is no one-size fits all approach that will enable researchers to respond to the needs of small scale farmers who are primarily concerned with sustainable livelihoods or medium to large-scale farms who wish to remain competitive and take advantage of any opportunities despite deteriorating environmental conditions and trade and economic restrictions. Within the last few years, the ACP region has seen a resurgence of emphasis on family farms which are being valued not only for their contribution to maintaining social order but to environmental sustainability. This dossier provides guidance and lessons learned on the need for the ACP region to apply a differentiated strategic approach for using science to enhance the performance of ACP agricultural sector.</dd>

	The poultry value chain in Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries involves both large-scale integrated enterprises and small-scale production systems. The former have benefited from capital investments, access to information and scientific research, whereas the latter remain isolated despite their significance. Family poultry comprises approximately 80% of the world's total poultry stock and plays a key role in many households in ACP countries for food and nutrition security, livelihoods and conservation of indigenous breeds. An analysis of the family poultry value chain, including its poor productivity and low financial and technical inputs, shows that it contrasts markedly with conditions in large-scale commercial poultry enterprises. Governments and researchers would be well advised to thoroughly review the family poultry value chains to identify priorities for science and innovation that can contribute to improved efficiency for the provision of eggs, live birds, fresh-chilled, frozen and other value-added poultry products.&nbsp;This summary is provided by CABI and CTA, July 2012.</dd>

	In this feature article, Adipala Ekwamu, Malcolm Blackie and Joyce Lewinger Moock focus on the experiences of an African-led and -managed organization, the Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Africa (RUFORUM), which aims to capture regional economies of scope and scale, to support innovative curriculum design, fill crucial gaps in the availability of postgraduate degrees, and ensure a quality standard for courses. RUFORUM, through its innovative programmes in its member university system and its established regional convening power is an effective advocate for transformation of tertiary agricultural science training and research.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, Africa records the lowest numbers of PhDs per 1000 inhabitants and the lowest contribution to global knowledge resources (∼2%). The recent surge of renewed interest in the agricultural sector as an engine of economic growth in Africa has resulted in many new initiatives and the strengthening of ongoing programmes that have been identified as successful. Operating in 18 countries, RUFORUM has a mandate to oversee graduate training and specialized networks in the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) countries. Under the guidance of senior African professionals, RUFORUM has grown from a crop-based network of 10 agricultural faculties into a regional broad-based consortium of 32 universities in Central, Eastern and Southern Africa. &nbsp;RUFORUM assumes that development is more likely to occur where there is an active, well-informed critical mass of locally based agricultural professionals to conduct relevant research. Another assumption is that the results of such research are more likely to be applied by strengthening a demand-driven research agenda – via linkages to smallholder farmers, small- and medium-sized agro-based enterprises post the farm gate, community organizations and policy makers to ensure the relevance and impact of such research, and by matching training and education to the potential job market.</p><p>In 2014–2018, RUFORUM will strengthen and scale its core activities, while stepping up its representational role for higher education.&nbsp;</p>

Efforts aimed at increasing smallholder productivity and transforming raw materials into value-added products through the uptake of locally relevant research and development outputs and investments in robust market strategies are directly related to the knowledge and skills of the human resource base that will lead, design and implement national agricultural programmes. It will be a major challenge for African countries to meet their human capital needs for a dynamic agricultural sector that can advance their economies over the coming years.</p><p>Currently, Africa records the lowest numbers of PhDs per 1000 inhabitants and the lowest contribution to global knowledge resources (≈2%), worldwide. The recent surge of renewed interest in the agricultural sector as an engine of economic growth in Africa has resulted in many new initiatives and the strengthening of ongoing programmes that have been identified as successful.&nbsp; This article focuses on the experiences of an African-led and -managed organisation, the Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Africa (RUFORUM), designed to capture regional economies of scope and scale, to support curriculum design innovation, fill crucial gaps in postgraduate degree offerings, and ensure a quality standard for courses. RUFORUM has improved both the relevance and quality of post-graduate education and research in member universities&nbsp;<a href="file:///C:/Users/CAAJ/Documents/08%20-%20August%20Sept%202014/New%20featured/CABI_RUFORUM-final_Capturing%20Economies%20of%20Scale%20in%20Building%20a%20New%20Generation_Approved%20by%20RUFORUM.doc#_ftn1" target="_self">[1]</a>. To date, it has served over 1197 postgraduate students (1005 MSc and 192 PhD) and 2,340 faculty, with nearly 40% of the student grants awarded to women.</p><a name="eztoc662675_1_0_1" id="eztoc662675_1_0_1"></a><h4><b>Mandate and milestones</b></h4><p>RUFORUM has grown, under the guidance of senior African professionals, from a crop-based network of 10 agricultural faculties into a regional broad-based consortium of 32 universities in eastern, central and southern Africa.&nbsp; Its strategic goals assume the following: &nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, that development is more likely to occur where there is an active, well-informed critical mass of locally based agricultural professionals to conduct relevant problem-solving research;&nbsp; Secondly, such research results are more likely to be applied when strengthening a demand-driven research agenda – via linkages to smallholder farmers, small- and medium-sized agro-based enterprises post the farm gate, community organisations, and policy-makers ensure research relevance and impact, and matching training and education to the potential job market.</p><p>Operating in 18 countries, RUFORUM has a mandate to oversee graduate training and specialisation networks in the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) countries. Its agenda is derived largely from a number of continent-wide policy frameworks, especially the Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Program (CAADP) and the African Union Policy Framework on Revitalising Higher Education in Africa.</p><p>The RUFORUM Secretariat, hosted by Makerere University, on behalf of the Uganda Government, provides the basic platform upon which activities are built. Its unique core programme structure consists of three MSc and seven PhD regional collaborative degree programmes&nbsp;<a href="file:///C:/Users/CAAJ/Documents/08%20-%20August%20Sept%202014/New%20featured/CABI_RUFORUM-final_Capturing%20Economies%20of%20Scale%20in%20Building%20a%20New%20Generation_Approved%20by%20RUFORUM.doc#_ftn2" target="_self">[2]</a> – together with quality assurance; competitive grant programmes, including hundreds of MSc graduate research grants, associated field attachments, programme awards, community action research programmes and institutional strengthening grants; supported by advanced work on ICT and M&amp;E. Through these initiatives, it ensures that postgraduates have relevant experience and skills not only to meet the needs of national agriculture systems, but also to become individual entrepreneurs active in the private sector and NGOs.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall network guidance is provided by its Board&nbsp;<a href="file:///C:/Users/CAAJ/Documents/08%20-%20August%20Sept%202014/New%20featured/CABI_RUFORUM-final_Capturing%20Economies%20of%20Scale%20in%20Building%20a%20New%20Generation_Approved%20by%20RUFORUM.doc#_ftn3" target="_self">[3]</a>, who are vice-chancellors of member universities, plus five other persons representing government, business, NGOs and national/regional research institutions. Other organs of the network include a Deans’ Committee, an International Advisory Panel, a Technical Committee that oversees quality assurance, and National Forums that frame the agenda for targeting of research and training activities.&nbsp; As a research and training network organisation, RUFORUM plays an important regional public goods role that enables spillover and improvement across its constituent countries and universities. The RUFORUM model is a high-leverage concept that influences much broader change in universities. It uses practical experience through competitive sub-grants together with specialised training sessions and intensive knowledge-sharing to expose universities to both the opportunities and need to produce more relevant graduates and research to service poor rural communities. Through its learning network it has impacted on attitudes, curricula and pedagogy and on university partnerships with smallholder farmers and diverse agricultural development agencies.</p><p>RUFORUM graduates acquire the training and skills needed to serve the needs of the agricultural bodies within the region, from national agricultural research and outreach institutes, to the private sector, and other key stakeholder organisations. They help transform production prospects, incomes, and food security in the agriculture sector, particularly for long-neglected smallholder farmers. RUFORUM combines ground-based, credible, specific initiatives together with focused regional activities to facilitate scale-up and impact.</p><p>In short, RUFORUM, through its innovative programmes in its member university system and its established regional convening power is an effective advocate for transformation of tertiary agricultural science training and research. In 2014-2018, it will strengthen and scale essential core activities, while stepping up its representational role for higher education with its enormous convening power – at many regional and international meetings, its Biennial Regional Conferences and its high-level gatherings with Ministers of Education and Ministers of Agriculture, the two sectors that RUFORUM straddles.</p><a name="eztoc662675_1_0_2" id="eztoc662675_1_0_2"></a><h4><b>Looking to the future: quality and focus</b></h4><p>For agricultural transformation to be central to sub-Saharan Africa’s poverty alleviation strategy, a step change in the quality and focus of the services supporting the sector is needed. This will involve expanding and strengthening access to agricultural inputs, improving research and extension services, introducing smallholder-friendly technologies, improving access to local and international markets, reducing land shortage and degradation, increasing investment in irrigation, and developing farmer co-operatives and associations. The generation of technology is insufficient in itself:&nbsp; the technologies have to reach – and be adopted by – many who have been bypassed by previous efforts. For much of the past thirty years, the major employer of agricultural graduates was the public sector, either in research in universities or public-sector research agencies. Today, however, employment is growing in civil society and the private sector, particularly self-employment. The seed industry illustrates the potential growth for private-sector demand for graduates. Private seed companies in southern and eastern Africa are performing well – maize seed sales increased by 54% between 2006 and 2007 and sales revenue, by 35% (Blackie, 2008). The seed industry needs skilled agronomists and marketing specialists who can build alliances and run demonstrations under a variety of situations, as shown by a 19% growth in employment over two years. Universities must now broaden their training from a heavy emphasis on research and technology generation to providing graduate capacity throughout the value chain. Data collected by Blackie<i> et al</i>. (2009) on demand for agricultural graduates in east and southern Africa, suggests that for every scientist working directly on developing solutions to farmer-identified problems, approximately a further eight skilled professionals (in fields such as marketing, entrepreneurship and finance) will be required. Agricultural universities and their graduates will need to engage directly with communities to spur rural transformations.</p><p>Lynam <i>et al.</i> (2013) reported that RUFORUM provides a platform for catalysing change in African higher education, incorporating innovations from elsewhere such as elements of the <i>Escuela de Agricultura de la Región Tropical Húmeda</i> (EARTH) University education model in Costa Rica (<a href="http://www.earth.ac.cr/en/about-earth/course-catalog/" target="_self">http://www.earth.ac.cr/en/about-earth/course-catalog/</a>) and engagement of universities in communities, akin to the US Land Grant Universities. RUFORUM has shown African universities can (a) produce competitive graduates suited to a differentiated labour market, (b) enhance relevant research targeting smallholders along several agricultural supply and value chains, and (c) create a dynamic regional platform that fosters collaboration, coordination and learning amongst member universities.&nbsp;</p><a name="eztoc662675_1_0_3" id="eztoc662675_1_0_3"></a><h4><b>Conclusion</b></h4><p>The RUFORUM Secretariat provides high leverage for RUFORM’s work at the regional and international level. RUFORUM will intensify capacity-building in a few pilot countries and enhance the use of digital technology, and focus on sustainable value chains in both crops and livestock, scale out and better align one or more of the regional MSc programmes, explore new forms of knowledge management and exchange including Open Education Resources (OER) and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) adapted to local ICT and capacity constraints. Learning from these pilots will generate public goods that will serve the entire network and open new opportunities for innovation and complementary resource flow.&nbsp;</p><a name="eztoc662675_1_0_4" id="eztoc662675_1_0_4"></a><h4><b>References</b></h4><p>Blackie, M. 2008.
