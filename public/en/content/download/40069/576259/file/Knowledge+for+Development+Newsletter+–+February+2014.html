Henning" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Jatropha_curcas1_henning.jpg">In this new feature article, Lynn Mytelka discusses some of the options that biofuels are already providing in developing countries and the factors that contributed to their positive impact on inclusive development.<br>
                    <br>
                    In 2007, rather than rely on imported diesel fuel for a future off-grid generator, the villagers of Garalo in Mali chose to plant jatropha on 440 ha of their land as part of a multi-goal rural electricity project. The long time to maturity of jatropha seed, however, has meant that in 2011 jatropha oil accounted for just 5-10% of the fuel used by the local mini-grid the villagers had built. Nonetheless, the project has produced some very positive results. Many came from the role that local farmers played in the project design. Of the 440 ha planted, 2 ha were prepared as a nursery and 95% of the fields were planted by individual farmers. A survey after two years showed that many farmers had chosen to intercrop jatropha and local food crops such as maize, sorghum, millet, peanut, sesame and beans, indicating that an either-or choice between using land for food or fuel is not essential. Farmers in Garalo have also developed and sustained close links to research institutions. This has led to considerable follow-up experimentation and local learning as well as improved methods of inter-cropping.<br>
                    <br>
                    The case of a women&rsquo;s group in Gbimsi in Northern Ghana illustrate how well-planned jatropha oil production has helped them augment significantly the processing of shea butter. Ownership of the project by the women's group allowed for diversifying from shea butter and producing different types of oil and fuels with the equipment that was initially meant for jatropha processing.<br>
                    <br>
                    Erroneous assumptions about the crop led to negative experiences especially in the case of large-scale projects undertaken by foreign investors (as in India, Ghana, Tanzania). In such cases, uncertainties associated with global pricing trends limit the role that jatropha can play as a driver of local development, especially for smallholders.<br>
                    <br>
                    In transitioning to clean and renewable energy, the pros and cons of all options need to be considered on their own merits in their local context. The very notion of building a bioeconomy in a developing country would have seemed unrealistic. Currently, however, the development of biofuels from sugarcane and second-generation cellulosic ethanol and diesel in Brazil and the ongoing research on enzymes to decompose wastes in South Africa and make diesel fuel from algae, suggest that this is no longer the case.<br>
                    <br>
                    Efforts are now needed to further strengthen local research capacities, and encourage participation in collaborative research and development (R&amp;D) projects by potential users of the output. For this to be effective, however, governments in developing countries must focus on the coordination of policies across government ministries, thus laying the foundation for the long-term development of a bioeconomy and the multiple options it will offer in the future.<br>

                    Retrospective: bottlenecks to <i>Jatropha curcas</i> bioenergy value-chain development in Africa &ndash; a Kenyan case

Henning" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Jatropha_curcas2_henning.jpg"> <i>Jatropha curcas</i> (jatropha), an undomesticated shrubby tree native to Central America, suddenly emerged as a promising bioenergy feedstock during the period 2003-2009, when rising petrol prices fuelled global interests in bioenergy crops. Jatropha was considered a &lsquo;silver bullet&rsquo; with claims of high-quality oil production and wide adaptability to diverse climatic zones and (marginal) soil types. Investors from developed nations were eager to grow it in large commercial plantations in Africa and elsewhere for export. However, many claims made regarding jatropha have proven highly exaggerated. By 2009, many media reports revealed disillusioning episodes across the developing world. Academics also began to question its commercial viability as a bioenergy feedstock. Bust followed boom, and many smallholder farmers were left confused and disillusioned.<br>
                    <br>
                    In Kenya, when the jatropha hype started, there were limits to the response of government, universities, and national and international agricultural research institutions in filling the knowledge gap regarding its production, processing and marketing. The extension service was unable to provide adequate support to guide farmers. Many of the early promoters had not conducted multi-year research trials under local conditions to verify their claims for jatropha and the knowledge shared among them did not come from local experience. Consequently, farmers had to apply sub-optimal management practices. High yields were not achieved partly because growers were still using unimproved germplasm, management practices were sub-optimal, and the biophysical boundaries of high jatropha yield were poorly defined.<br>
                    <br>
                    In the Kenya case, there was inadequate R&amp;D to support all stages of value chain development from production to processing to markets. The policy instruments to support the local market development for biofuels, including the R&amp;D and extension and business development services, must be established to encourage investment and sustain industry development. Success in value chain development in one industry or even one country cannot be transported to another environment without adequate investments in R&amp;D.<br>

                    This report by ODI, UK, summarises the results of scoping exercises carried out in early 2013 into the status of biofuel projects in five countries: Ethiopia, Indonesia, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia. These scoping exercises were undertaken to determine: (i) Whether countries which are commonly referred to as important for biofuel production have seen proportionate levels of biofuel project activity; and (ii) if so, whether projects have reached a stage at which it is possible to assess the impacts of biofuel projects on local food security. The report concludes that in the four African countries, there is little basis to comprehensively investigate the possible effects of increased biofuel production on food security. What could be further researched is the impact of the displacement of people and their agricultural activities, which often occurs as part of biofuel projects. It is too early to know whether the contraction in biofuels project development is indicative of a temporary setback or whether it is of a more permanent nature. However, the number of projects which have already ceased their operations and the time required for new projects to start up operations indicate that production will not reach significant levels in the four African countries anytime soon.<br>

Mwewa of the Department of Agriculture, Polytechnic of Namibia, Namibia present a comprehensive review of the status quo of developments bio-fuels including support measures driving the social, environmental and economic impacts of their development. Their key findings indicated that, if the biofuel market proves lucrative, there is possible diversion of labour and land to bio-fuel projects and that competition of input use might lead to reduction of food production and high food prices. However the price of bio-fuel feedstock from jatropha in Zambia was not attractive enough to encourage farmers to grow more jatropha which has raised major concerns by policy makers.<br>

                    Three transnational research projects that were funded during the first phase of ERA-ARD have produced an editorial in <i>GCB Bioenergy</i> about jatropha. They conclude that jatropha has potential to contribute to sustainable rural development in Africa, but that at present it is not sufficiently productive and profitable to play that role. Strong efforts along the whole value chain from the production of jatropha seed until its end use will be indispensable in achieving this goal.<br>

                    Fiji's Department of Energy has a biofuel implementation programme, and this webpage serves as a portal to the department&rsquo;s various projects. The department has successfully commissioned and installed three biofuel mills on the islands of Koro, Rotuma and Cicia. These mills are to serve the communities in terms of a consistent supply of clean green fuel and to uplift the standard of living through the provision of economic activity that is associated with the mills. Each mill has been designed to cater for the copra produced in all three islands.<br>

                    In February 2014, the Centre for Research on Evaluation, Science and Technology (CREST) at the University of Stellenbosch published the first comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the roles and functioning of science granting councils (or equivalent bodies) of 17 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The study found that dedicated funding councils were largely characteristic of the science systems of Anglophone countries. Francophone countries, such as Rwanda and Cameroon traditionally do not have ST&amp;I funding councils. However, Burkina Faso, C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire and Senegal do have efficient funding agencies particularly in agriculture. The study identified a number of models that capture the most commonly found organisational arrangements for public research funding: The paradigm principal-agent model (delegation of responsibility for research funding to a autonomous body); the sector-differentiated model (different research funding councils for different sectors in the science system &ndash; causing challenges around coordination in science funding); the multiple principal-agents model ('non-government' science funding channels, usually international donors &ndash; there is no coordination between these channels); and the embedded principal-agent model (an extension of government with no obvious independence). The study developed &lsquo;milestones&rsquo; in the areas of science and technology governance and policy development to allow for comparison between countries&rsquo; S&amp;T trajectories.<br>

                    Ian Boyd, Chief Scientific Adviser at the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, UK, explains why science is an essential component of policy-making. In Boyd's opinion, the scientific community does not always understand its role in this process. Science advice for policy faces two difficulties, the issue of where authoritative comment stops and political point of view starts, and the low-dimensional view of a multi-dimensional (or complex) problem usually taken by scientists. These two difficulties create a gap between the scientists' views of what policy outcomes should look like, and what these outcomes actually are once they have been through the mangle of policy development. This can be the source of dissatisfaction among scientists and can create an unsatisfactory dynamic between scientists and policy-makers. The role of science should be to provide information to those having to make decisions, including the public, and to ensure that the uncertainties around that information are made clear. It is thus important for scientists to stick to the evidence and its interpretation. Boyd uses a recent example involving the control of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in the UK to illustrate his point.<br>

                    The Africa-EU High-Level Policy Dialogue (HLPD) on STI commissioned this study to assess existing bi-regional STI cooperation initiatives and to identify successful, best practice models of Africa and Europe cooperation. This study also identified gaps and effective financial mechanisms that could have a positive impact cooperative initiatives. In terms of collaboration, financing, and private sector participation, the report notes that the current funding landscape is rather dependent on European and on international instruments, weakening the potential of genuine co-ownership. Promising co-financing models for common research priorities are being piloted (notably by the ERAfrica consortium). The report argues that joint funding, strong leadership and effective governance; clarity and understanding of joint objectives; strong interpersonal relations, equitable resource and benefits sharing, full transparency and open communication all build create mutual trust and foster co-ownership as necessary conditions for optimal efficiency. Other topics addressed by the study include: impact, success criteria, gaps, barriers and challenges.<br>

                    The Joint Research Programming Initiative on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change (FACCE-JPI), jointly led by INRA and BBSRC, celebrates its 3-year anniversary with the launch of its first biennial Implementation Plan, show-casing the role of FACCE-JPI in the research on the interplay between agriculture, food security and climate change. The Plan addresses subjects that are central to FACCE&rsquo;s ambitions, for example the improvement of agricultural soil quality, the sustainable intensification of European crop and livestock systems and plant disease epidemiology under climate change. It also foresees the creation of a network of experimental climate change studies on crop and grassland systems. After three years of activity and already five joint actions launched, FACCE-JPI is no longer working at the level of coordination of national policies, but more ambitiously on alignment and convergence of these, around a commonly agreed Strategic Research Agenda (SRA).<br>

This report, authored by Catherine Beaudry (Canada) and Irene Friesenhahn (Germany), provides a snapshot of recent scientific literature and new analyses of the state of young scholars in different world regions. GloSYS identified global deficits and a need for action in the following areas: Mentoring and support structures; focused training; transparency and fairness; working conditions; and cultivating values. The GloSYS study provides a framework, against which future progress can be monitored. The central findings of a precursor project and the resulting recommendations from GloSYS can serve as a basis to improve the state of young researchers throughout the world.<br>

                    This monograph on the System of Crop Intensification (SCI), published by the SRI International Network and Resources Center (SRI-Rice), Cornell University, USA, is a compilation of extraordinary reports from the field written by the Centre's Norman Uphoff and Erika Striger and their research partners from South Asia and East Africa. SCI, an ensemble of agro-ecological innovations generalised from the precursor System of Rice Intensification (SRI), aims to achieve higher output with less use of or less expenditure on land, labour, capital, and water &ndash; all by making modifications in crop management practices. The contributors to this monograph are reporting as initiators or supporters of the changes being introduced, not as researchers studying them, although all have done and continue to do publishable research. By communicating observed outcomes achieved under real-world circumstances as accurately as possible, this information could stimulate the interest of others to undertake more systematic studies and to help establish scientific explanations for promoting the greater utilisation of SCI adaptations. The focal crops of the systems of agricultural intensification described in this monograph include wheat, tef, maize, finger millet, sugarcane, legumes and vegetables.<br>

                    To understand better the importance of the different traits that make up the quality of the rice grain and obtain a full picture of rice quality demographics, a research team led by Mariafe Calingacion of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has engaged with local experts across the world to perform a full assessment of all major rice quality trait characteristics and importantly, to determine how these are combined in the most preferred varieties for each of their regions. Physical as well as biochemical characteristics have been monitored and this has resulted in the identification of no less than 18 quality trait combinations. This complexity reveals the extent of the specificity of consumer preference. Further assessment of these combinations at the variety level reveals that several groups still comprise varieties which consumers can readily identify as being different. This emphasises the shortcomings in the current tools available to assess rice quality. Only with additional tools and research, will it be possible to define directed strategies for rice breeding which are able to combine important agronomic features with the demands of local consumers for specific quality attributes.<br>

                    This new joint report by World Bank, FAO, and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) on the prospect for fisheries and aquaculture shows that fish farming will provide close to two thirds of global food fish consumption by 2030. It estimates that catches from wild capture fisheries will level off while demand from an emerging global middle class will increase substantially. Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to see a per capita fish consumption decline of 1% per year from 2010 to 2030 but, due to rapid population growth of 2.3% in the same period, the region's total fish consumption will grow by 30% overall. By 2030, 62 % of food fish will come from aquaculture with the fastest supply growth likely to come from tilapia, carp, and catfish. Threats from large-scale disease outbreaks in aquaculture and climate change-related impacts could dramatically alter this, and the potential of small scale aquaculture must be exploited.<br>

                    Dalal Al-Abdulrazzak and Daniel Pauly of the University of British Columbia, Canada, looked at recent technological advances that could help with the monitoring of fishery catches. Statistics submitted by countries to the FAO frequently neglect or under-report the contribution of small-scale fisheries, as well as illegal catches and discards. Trying to tackle this problem, the researchers have used freely available global satellite imagery via Google Earth, to count intertidal fishing weirs off the coast of six countries in the Persian Gulf. Combining the number of weirs with assumptions about daily catches and the length of the fishing season they estimated that the fishing gear contributed to a regional catch is up to six times higher than the officially reported catches. These results provide the first example of fisheries catch estimates from space, and point to the potential for remote-sensing approaches to validate catch statistics in fisheries.<br>

                    In this case study of a fishing community in Ocean View, Cape Town, South Africa, researcher Moenieba Isaacs of the University of Western Cape, examines a snoek (<i>Thyrsites atun</i>) fishery that operates through a community supply chain and informal markets. It found that this small scale fishery operates much differently than that of the high value regulated species, and yet plays a significant role in the livelihoods of artisanal fishers and in the food security of poor households. The findings of this case study show the failures of existing policy frameworks to take into account these smaller supply chains and point to the implications for the implementation of the new small-scale fisheries policy in South Africa, notably regarding the role of certification.<br>

                    Jessica Blythe and colleagues from the University of Victoria, Canada draw on case study research in Mozambique that combines national landings statistics and career history interviews with fish harvesters to generate a historical description of social-ecological interactions within the coastal Mozambican fishery. At the national level, the analysis points toward trends of fishing intensification and decline in targeted species, and it highlights the significant impact of small-scale fisheries on marine stocks. At the local level, fishermen are experiencing changes in fish abundance and distribution and in their physical, social, and cultural environments, and have responded by increasing their fishing effort (with bigger nets and bigger boats). Implication of these findings for future governance point to a need to better understand the socio-ecological drivers of change in fishing behaviour of coastal communities.<br>

                    IRIN reports on today&rsquo;s difficulties faced by the small scale fishermen in Mozambique. Among the most pressing challenges affecting the livelihoods of the country's small scale fishing sector are invasive species, illegal fishing practices and rapid economic and population growth. A new type of prawn is taking over the habitat from the local, much tastier prawns that are in demand internationally, providing only little returns for the fishermen. Also apparent are the proliferation of illegal fishing gear like chicocota nets, made of mosquito nets, to catch even the smallest prey. In addition the destruction of mangroves has drastically cut the potential for stock regeneration of staple fish.<br>

Brysting from the University of Oslo, Norway, present a case study of the role of genetic resources and seed systems in adapting to climatic stress from in semi-arid agro-ecological zone of Tanzania. In this case, crop adaptation involves the adoption of improved maize varieties combined with continued use of local varieties of both maize and sorghum. Analysis shows that households receiving extension service and owning livestock are more likely to switch to drought-tolerant varieties as a response to climatic stress than those without these assets. The seed system in the study area consists of both formal and informal elements. The informal channels supply the highest quantities of both sorghum and maize seeds. Recycling of improved varieties of maize is common and the majority of households practice seed selection. Detailed assessment of the three different categories of genetic resources &ndash; local, improved and farmer-recycled varieties &ndash; reveals that drought tolerance is more frequently reported as a reason for growing local varieties than for growing improved varieties of maize and sorghum.<br>

Applications were also tested in Tunisia, Ukraine, and Uganda, where they proved a feasible starting point for adapting the toolbox to the agricultural context of different countries. In an agricultural context, biodiversity - genetic, species and habitat diversity- and its characteristics are particularly important, yet not much is known about farmland biodiversity and how it is sustained.<br>

SUNRAY was conducted from January 2010 until December 2012. The findings are summarised in a number of manuscripts. A paper summarises the findings of the SUNRAY on priorities for nutrition research and enabling environment is published in <i>Plos Medicine</i>. The views of African researchers on how the operating environment for nutrition research can be improved in sub-Saharan Africa were published in <i>PLOS ONE</i>. As an outcome of this SUNRAY, a 'Roadmap for nutrition research in sub-Saharan Africa' was circulated for consultation internationally.<br>
                    The priority areas identified for nutrition research were (i) community interventions to improve nutritional status, (ii) behavioural strategies to improve nutritional status, and (iii) food security interventions to improve nutrition. The priority actions identified for creating an enabling nutrition research environment were (i) better governance of nutrition research, (ii) alignment of nutrition research funding with priorities identified within SSA, (iii) increased capacity development for nutrition research competencies, and (iv) enhanced information sharing and communication of nutrition research findings.<br>

                    Johanna T. Dwyer of Tufts Medical School, Boston, USA and colleagues from various research institutes review in this article current food fortification in the United States. They discus and evaluate the value of fortification, the success of current fortification efforts, and the future role of fortification in preventing or reversing nutrient inadequacies. Fortification of the food supply with vitamins and minerals is a public health strategy to enhance nutrient intakes of the population without increasing caloric intake. Many individuals in the United States would not achieve recommended micronutrient intakes without food fortification. The achievement and maintenance of a desirable level of nutritional quality in the nation's food supply therefore is an important public health objective. The authors argue that, while the addition of nutrients to foods can help maintain and improve the overall nutritional quality of diets, indiscriminate fortification of foods could result in over- and under-fortification and nutrient imbalances in the diets of individuals. Any changes in food fortification policy must be considered within the context of the impact they will have on all segments of the population and of food technology and safety applications and their limitations.<br>

                    In this article Julian M. Alston (UC Davis, USA) and Philip G. Pardey (University of Minnesota, USA) revisit the links between agricultural research and development (R&amp;D) and its consequences for nutrition and health outcomes of the poor in the context of two twenty-first century conundrums. First, while many of the world&rsquo;s poor remain undernourished, paradoxically, growing numbers of people from a very broad range of income and social strata are overweight or obese. Second, rates of investment in agricultural research are slowing in many countries in spite of continuing high social rates of return to the investments, a trend toward higher food prices, and slowing rates of farm productivity growth in many countries. In this article, the authors provide answers to the following questions: To what extent is the agricultural abundance (enabled by public R&amp;D policy and investment) responsible for the rise of obesity? What is the nature of the trade-offs between health and nutrition problems arising from increasing food abundance versus health and nutrition problems arising from food scarcity? Should societies use agricultural R&amp;D as an instrument of public health policy or other dimensions of social policy? The authors conclude that in the political reality of agricultural science funding, it will continue to be better to accept funding conditional on it being used for a particular &ndash; lower payoff &ndash; purpose if the alternative is to have an even worse problem of underinvestment in the total portfolio.<br>

                    A new study of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA, Austria), published in the journal <i>Global Change Biology</i>, demonstrates that a growing imbalance between phosphorus and nitrogen fertiliser use in Africa would lead to crop yield reductions of nearly 30% by 2050. Underuse of phosphorus-based fertilisers in Africa currently contributes to a growing yield gap &ndash; the difference between how much crops could produce in ideal circumstances compared to actual yields. This phosphorus-specific yield gap currently lies at around 10% for subsistence farmers, but will grow to 27% by 2050 if current trends continue. While nitrogen-based fertiliser usage has begun to increase in Africa in the last 10 years, the application of phosphorus to cropland has not kept pace, leading to a growing imbalance between nitrogen and phosphorus levels in soil. The new study shows that increases in nitrogen and phosphorus inputs must happen in a way that provides crops with the balanced nutrient input they need.<br>

                    Exploring global changes in nitrogen and phosphorus cycles in agriculture induced by livestock production over the 1900&ndash;2050 period

                    Crop-livestock production systems are the largest cause of human alteration of the global nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycles. This research report by Mario Herrero (ed) of ILRI is a comprehensive spatially explicit inventory of N and P budgets in livestock and crop production systems. It shows that in the beginning of the 20th century, nutrient budgets were either balanced and surpluses if any were small and that between 1900 and 1950, global soil N surplus almost doubled and P surplus increased by a factor of 8. Between 1950 and 2000, the global surplus of N increased by almost 400% and that of P to more than 500%. Most surplus N is an environmental loss and surplus P is lost by runoff or accumulates as residual soil P. Despite rapidly increasing recovery of N and P in crop and livestock, global nutrient surpluses continue to increase. Alternative management of livestock production systems shows that combinations of intensification, better integration of animal manure in crop production, and matching N and P supply to livestock requirements can effectively reduce nutrient flows. A shift in human diets, with poultry or pork replacing beef, can reduce nutrient flows in countries with intensive ruminant production.<br>

                    The MarkSim GCM tool can be used to generate daily rainfall, maximum and minimum temperatures and solar radiation information over multiple years that are characteristic of climates anywhere on the planet. The first version of MarkSim GCM became available in June 2011 and has now been updated, including the Google Earth interface, in which the tool is embedded. Some new features have also been added. For instance, as before the user can pick any point on the earth&rsquo;s surface and generate daily weather data for that point. Now, the user can also plot climate data, in terms of the monthly mean values of rainfall and daily maximum and minimum temperature. In addition, MarkSim GCM can be used to generate daily data that are to some extent characteristic of future climates.<br>

                    In this report Peter McCornick and his team at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) synthesise years of IWMI research. They argue that while the exact impact of climate change on water resources requires ongoing research, the development of more resilient food production systems based on smarter water use is the most robust response. They detail a range of options for governments and communities to 'future-proof' food production, which, if combined, could significantly improve the use of water in agriculture. These range from small-scale methods for storing rainwater on-farm and using it more efficiently to large infrastructure investments, such as dam and reservoir construction. Underground water storage to capture floodwater is highlighted as one promising new avenue of research.<br>

                    In this study, Tom Gleeson (McGill University, Canada) and Yoshihide Wada (Utrecht University, The Netherlands) analyze and interpret groundwater stress across whole nations using multiple data sources for the first time. They focus on two nations with the highest national groundwater abstraction rates in the world, the United States and India, and use recently developed groundwater footprints and multiple datasets of groundwater recharge and withdrawal derived from hydrologic models and data synthesis. The results indicate that the uncertainty is generally greater between datasets than within datasets and that much of the uncertainty is due to recharge estimates. Assessment of groundwater stress consistently across a nation and assessment of uncertainty using multiple datasets are critical for the development of a science-based rationale for policy and management, especially with regard to where and to what extent to focus limited research and management resources.<br>

                    South Africa could soon have a cluster of up to seven cosmic-ray moisture probes installed in agricultural, forestry and remote areas. These probes use cosmic-ray neutrons to deliver up-to-date readings of the moisture content of soil. Soil moisture is inversely related to the neutrons in the air above the soil surface. State of the art equipment using infrared analysers and three dimensional sonic anemometers will be used to complement the soil water cosmic-ray probe footprint for studies on the effects of soil moisture dynamics on plant water and carbon exchange. The probes have the potential to provide hydro-meteorologists with new methods of evaluating surface soil water. The continuous data streams linked to the new Cosmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS) continental-scale network will be of relevance to hydro-meteorologists interested in land-atmosphere interactions, ecologists interested in the impact of soil water on ecological status and evolution, remote sensing scientists for soil moisture calibration and validation, surface-water and groundwater modellers, and agricultural scientists interested in understanding and predicting the relationship between soil moisture and crop yield.<br>

The software facilitates the analysis of time series of low and medium resolution remote sensing images. SPIRITS is an integrated and flexible free software environment for analyzing satellite derived image time series in crop and vegetation monitoring. With this toolbox, time series of low and medium resolution sensors such as SPOT-Vegetation and MODIS-Terra/Aqua can be processed and examined. It can be used to perform and to automatise many spatial and temporal processing steps on time series and to extract spatially aggregated statistics. Vegetation indices and their anomalies can be rapidly mapped and statistics can be plotted and interpreted in seasonal graphs to be shared with analysts and decision makers.<br>

The trial was carried out for two consecutive seasons. The experiment was carried out in three farmers&rsquo; fields while the trial at KARI's Tigoni research station was meant for comparison. Results show that planting of tubers after storage in DLS gave significantly more yields than planting freshly harvested tubers.<br>

Results of this farm storage trial indicated that DLS could be used by potato growers for prolonged seed storage the following season. This way the growers could be assured of good potato harvests due to the use of well sprouted tubers. This is critical in case of seasons with low or less than average rainfall as experienced in recent years.<br>
