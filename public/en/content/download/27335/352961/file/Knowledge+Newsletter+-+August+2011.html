<H1>Encouraging private investment in agricultural research: Myth or necessity for developing countries</H1><br />

The focus for many developing countries is on increasing both public and private investments for improving the performance of the agricultural sector; an issue that is being pursued at national, regional and international levels. Identifying the right technologies, developing output and input markets, prioritizing agriculture in national development strategies, and private-public partnerships are important aspects for a successful research and development (R&D) and technology adoption framework. Agricultural R&D has the potential to reduce costs and/or raise output and therefore to shift the supply curve to the right. The InterAcademy Council and other public and private agencies have recognized the critical role of S&T in economic and social development and have recommended a doubling of public agricultural R&D funding by 2015.
<br /><br />
Significant lags in the onset of benefits associated with some agricultural R&D endeavours (coupled with weak IP legislation) raise uncertainties for potential investors; there is a fairly long period from the inception of R&D to adoption of technology. Such lags call for sustained funding in order to achieve the high returns that are associated with agricultural R&D, but which take some time to develop. This scenario offers tough choices to private investors when coupled with an uncertain policy environment and limited demand in some developing countries.
<br /><br />
The relatively low private investments in R&D in developing countries can be attributed to a number of constraints: predominance in subsistence crop production which do not augur well for investors who desire lucrative returns from value-addition; the low proportion of purchased inputs in total production do not provide the incentives that drive private enterprise; underdeveloped and small-sized input and output markets; poor infrastructure; stifling regulations that encourage rent-seeking; and an unfavourable policy environment for private sector agro-business growth. All of these constraints contribute to a low rate of introduction of new technologies. For the private sector to engage in R&D mechanisms are needed which allow them to recoup their costs and make profits. These include a number of enabling factors: favourable policy environment, enactment of IP rights regime, a pool of qualified researchers, national legislation that makes it possible to import and test new technology (without unnecessary bureaucracy and heavy tax burdens while also respecting environmental, safety and other concerns) and other attractive incentives.
<br /><br/>

Juxtaposing the current low levels of agricultural R&D and the high potential payoffs, a grossly underfunded pillar of agricultural development is revealed. </DIV><p>Read the whole article:<DIV class=url><A href="http://knowledge.cta.int/en/content/view/full/14258?utm_campaign=newsletterEN&amp;utm_medium=newsletterlink&amp;utm_source=newsletterEN"

<H1>Private-sector agricultural research and innovation in Senegal - Recent policy, investment, and capacity trends</H1>

		By Gert-Jan Stads and Louis Sene; IFPRI, 2011.<br/>
		Agricultural research and development (R&D) in Senegal has historically been spearheaded by the public sector. In 2008, the private sector accounted for just 14 percent of the country&acute;s total (public and private) agricultural R&D investments. While the public sector dominates R&D related to food crops, private-sector companies play a key role when it comes to export commodities, including cotton, groundnuts, and fisheries and horticultural products. Although data on public R&D capacity and investments are widely available, comprehensive information on R&D conducted by the private sector is not regularly documented. This paper attempts to fill this knowledge gap with new data and analysis on private R&D investment in Senegalese agriculture. In doing so, the paper also provides insights into policy and institutional issues constraining private investment, and options for addressing these constraints.

		A potentially explosive situation exists in the rural areas as extension and advisory service organisations struggle for recognition in Zimbabwe. A large number swamp the districts as diminishing returns set in. The Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development provides agricultural extension and advisory services through the Departments of Veterinary Services (DVS), Livestock Production and development (LPD), Agricultural, Technical and Extension Services (AGRITEX). A number of organisations augment public agricultural extension and advisory services such as; public research-cum-extension organisations; donor-supported rural development programmes; international and private research centres; farmers&acute; associations; Non Governmental Organisations (NGO) and bilateral donors; private agrochemical input suppliers; commodity processors and exporters. Mr Mandla Siwela, a small scale farmer in Bubi district said, "We are overwhelmed by the number of meetings we are expected to attend in one week. At times people are compelled to attend. That robs us of the time we are supposed to work in our plots. Lack of coordination between service providers at ward level is disrupting on-farm programs." According to farmers, extension and advisory service multiplicity is disabling information dissemination and causing confusion, hindering farm growth that itself acts as a stimulant for the emergence of more diverse opportunities in the rural economy such as rural services, non-farm enterprises and growth points. Farmers grieve over lack of information alleging that it contributes to poor margins that kill backward and forward linkages. Some farmers moan over inefficient markets due to inadequate information.

	A number of factors have been identified as being responsible for the lack of or limited growth of PNG&acute;s agricultural growth (except for one or two sub-sector) and James Laraki of PNG&acute;s National Agricultural Research Institute believes poor agricultural extension has been one of the significant factors. According to the author writing on Malum Nalu&acute;s weblog, the dismal performance of extension began with the decentralisation of extension services from the National Department of Agriculture and Livestock (NDAL) to the provinces soon after independence. This created 19 extension systems without any plans and adequate resources. This followed with the creation of commodity boards and proliferation of NGOs, church-based extension services and other service providers, all with varied plans and client base. This resulted in extension services becoming very fragmented, with most of the providers working on ad-hoc basis. A new policy on agriculture extension system is required to focus on the development of an effective and efficient extension system.

	In 2010 CTA in collaboration with CCST, CARDI, UWI and TTFC launched a Caribbean- wide Agriculture and Science Film and Video Competition as a mechanism to promote the importance of science, technology and innovation for improving agricultural performance and supporting economic development. The competition encouraged creative, technology savvy young professionals (persons 18-35 years) with passion for communicating ideas and an interest in leveraging the full potential of science and technology for agricultural and economic development to participate in the competition. The Finals of the competition and the Awards ceremony were held in July 2011 at Crowne Plaza in Trinidad and Tobago. Twenty-two teams from eight Caribbean countries vied for the top prizes. The video productions will be used to increase public awareness and engagement in science, technology and innovation for overcoming the challenges facing Caribbean agricultural and rural development and encourage young professionals to consider training and careers in science and agriculture. Some of the winning film and video pieces can be viewed on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=1490381356944&oid=69728755793&comments" target="_blank"><u>our facebook page</u></a>.

	Breeding crops with deeper roots could significantly reduce atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide and make crops more drought resistant, according to a research <a href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/news/display/?id=7296" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a> conducted at the University of Manchester. Reporting in the journal, Annals of Botany, professor Douglas Kell calculated that breeding crops whose roots extend 2 meters underground, rather than the 1-meter roots common to many crops, could double the amount of carbon captured from the atmosphere. In principle, any crop could be treated in this way, giving more productive yields while also being better for the environment. Kell reported that creating crops and plants with deeper and bushier roots would also lead to more water and nutrient retention and produce more sustainable plant yields as the world warms and droughts increase in water-stressed regions.

	For fruits, cereals and leguminous plants such as oranges, wheat, beans and olives to grow in hot and dry climates, they must be irrigated regularly. And very often the water used comes from deep wells. In Egypt, many farmers currently use diesel generators to water their fields. A model project in Upper Egypt shows that other methods are possible. Here, a photovoltaic stand-alone system takes care of irrigating a wheat field. Concentrator photovoltaic system (CPV) modules – which, due to their higher degree of effectiveness and their particular construction, require far less space than traditional PV modules – supply the energy, while Fresnel lenses concentrate the rays of the sun onto pinhead-sized multi-junction solar cells. With the aid of a tracking motor, the CPV cells, which are attached to a pillar, follow the sun precisely to achieve an optimized yield of solar light. They supply the energy for a submersible pump that pumps the water up from a well that is 105 feet deep and for a small desalination unit that satisfies farmers&acute; potable water requirements. The CPV cells also supply the energy for PV-module trackers, the monitoring and control system and an air-conditioning unit that cools the utility room of the facility.(<a href="http://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2010-2011/20/solar-power-management.jsp" target="_blank"><u>Frauenhofer-Gesellschaft</u></a> via <a href="http://www.alphagalileo.org/ViewItem.aspx?ItemId=109523&CultureCode=en" target="_blank"><u>AlphaGalileo</u></a>, 2/8/2011)

	The excessive use of irrigation water has resulted in serious environmental concerns in many dry-land countries, where rising demand has deteriorated groundwater resources, depleted aquifers, and accelerated saltwater intrusion. Scientists in Spain are working on new technologies to classify and monitor irrigated crops with a goal of promoting sustainable agricultural practices. The field studies the researchers designed were to evaluate the potential of multispectral reflectance and seven vegetation indices in the visible and near-infrared spectral range for discriminating and classifying bare soil and several horticultural irrigated crops. The research is the first step of a broader project with the overall goal of using satellite imagery with high spatial and multispectral resolutions for mapping irrigated crops.

	Scientists at the University of Toronto and the University of Saskatchewan (both in Canada) have developed a conceptual framework to diagnosis nutrient and non-nutrient interactions in agro-ecosystems. In this study, scientists analyzed data from field trials of cocoa and pigeon pea intercropping systems using vector analysis. They quantified nutrient and non-nutrient interactions, illustrating the application of this analysis for managing agro-forestry systems. Using their advanced model, scientists were able to increase the yields of both cocoa and pigeon pea rotated with maize. Additionally, phosphorus concentrations declined, reducing environmental impact. These improvements were attributed to better light conditions for the cocoa and alleviated soil moisture competition for the pigeon pea crop. The evaluation of both nutrient and non-nutrient resource interactions provides information needed to sustainably manage agroforestry systems. Improved diagnosis of appropriate nutrient usage will help increase yields and also reduce financial and environmental costs. To achieve this, a management support system that allows for site-specific evaluation of nutrient-production imbalances is needed.

<H1>ADOPT: How to estimate the timeframes for project impacts in innovation and agriculture</H1>

	<a href="http://www.eldis.org/go/display&type=Document&id=58580 " target="_blank"><u>This paper</u></a> reports on the reasoning underpinning the development of the Adoption and Diffusion Outcome Prediction Tool (ADOPT), i.e., an increasing demand from research, development and extension (R, D & E) agencies for estimates of likely extent of adoption and the likely timeframes for project impacts. The tool has been designed to predict an innovation&acute;s likely peak extent of adoption and time for reaching that peak. The tool is structured around four aspects of adoption: 1) characteristics of the innovation, 2) characteristics of the population, 3) actual advantage of using the innovation, and 4) learning of the actual advantage of the innovation. Findings in the paper show that : (a) without considering the influences on adoption and diffusion, R, D & E investment can result in poor returns and unsatisfactory on-ground benefits; (b) there is demand from R, D & E funding agencies for ex-ante assessments of adoptability and proposed practice change resulting from R, D & E investments; (c) the use of a tool based on established adoption and diffusion principles offers a level of consistency when comparing forecasts of impacts across projects; (d) understanding the attributes of innovations allows the extension strategy to be modified so that levels of adoption and diffusion can be improved. <br />

	This IFRPI <a href="http://www.ifpri.org/publication/strategy-agricultural-statistics-ghana" target="_blank"><u>report</u></a> provides a brief synopsis of the reasons why the current agricultural statistics system in Ghana is inadequate, and gives justification for the development of a revamped agricultural statistics system, and a concrete strategy for moving forward. In particular, the aim is to operationalize a process to enhance Ghana&acute;s agricultural statistics system to the point where it can regularly (annually) provide higher quality (precisely measured), disaggregated (district level) data for broader and deeper analysis of agricultural topics (greater crop, livestock, forestry, and aquaculture coverage) in order to facilitate improved, evidence based monitoring, planning, and research at the central and local administrative levels.

	By A. Ely, P. Van Zwanenberg, A. Stirling; STEPS Centre Working Paper 45; 2011.<br />
	<a href="http://www.steps-centre.org/PDFs/Technology_Assessment.pdf" target="_blank"><u>This study</u></a> explores the role that &acute;new models&acute; of technology assessment can play in improving the lives of poor and vulnerable populations in the developing world. The new models addressed here combine citizen and decision-maker participation with technical expertise. Technology assessment (TA) involves the collection, interpretation and evaluation of information and perspectives around contending technological options. In the absence of TA, technologies may fail to serve their desired function, or create unforeseen negative impacts. This report examines the utility of these new models of TA in a broad range of geographical contexts, and the extent they can be applied to improve the lives of poor and vulnerable populations in the developing world. Drawing on lessons from the past, and paying attention to recent experiences with a variety of approaches, the report highlights how the new models of technology assessment can contribute to development goals and suggests how particular components of the new methods and processes might work well in developing countries.
