                    <i>Cornelia E. Nauen, Mundus maris &ndash; Sciences and Arts for Sustainability asbl, Brussels, Belgium.</i><br>
                    <img title="EU Poogramme logo - cut" style="margin: 6px 6px 0px 0px; width: 160px; float: left;" alt="Image" src=

                     Sustainable improvement of human well-being depends crucially on knowledge, its production, organisation, distribution,
                    appropriation and wise use. Access to information, the capacity to generate and use scientific and technological knowledge and
                    human innovation give institutions and countries an edge. For ACP countries, past development efforts that ignored local
                    circumstances, technologies and systems of knowledge wasted enormous amounts of time and resources and failed to achieve the
                    desired result: &lsquo;sustainable development&rsquo;.<br>
                    <br>
                    Nauen notes that &lsquo;We are witnessing an almost incredible diversification and acceleration of knowledge production via
                    expanded scientific and technological applications&rsquo;. At the same time, there is the risk of losing some local knowledge and
                    well-tested experiences e.g. that which is codified in indigenous knowledge systems when technological discontinuity makes it
                    socially and sometimes practically less desirable. Nauen argues that &lsquo;Incorporating the wealth of existing local and
                    indigenous knowledge significantly enhances the ability to innovatively adapt to changing circumstances&rsquo;. Drawing on
                    examples of years of ACP-EU cooperation, she indicates that the rise of research and innovation in more countries diversifies the
                    international landscape and creates new opportunities for ACP countries which are investing in their ARD capabilities and valuing
                    their home-grown knowledge systems.<br>
                    <br>
                    Nauen concludes that the landscape of research and scientific cooperation is changing and that while universities, research
                    establishments and others see the need for cooperating and associating with the best in their fields from anywhere, recent policy
                    emphasis on unspecified and broad-based competitiveness, may counter-intuitively lead to less cooperation. Yet, an ability to
                    cooperate is what countries need for achieving competitiveness and developing solutions to the societal challenges surpassing
                    their own means.<br>

                    report was presented at the November 2012 event 'Adding Value to Local Foods for Food and Nutrition Security: Myth or Strategic
                    Option'. It is based on a study that was commissioned by the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU
                    (CTA). The specific objectives were to survey and report on agro-processing enterprises in the Caribbean to assist in charting a
                    three-year plan for adding value to local produce. A questionnaire was developed and distributed to agro-processing industries
                    and responses were received from ten small, one medium and two large scale agro-enterprises. Data were obtained on, the primary
                    raw material utilised, processing methods, types of processed products, training, food analysis and labelling, knowledge on
                    Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP), food regulation and legislation, marketing of the products and any
                    recommended activities for food processing companies in the Caribbean.<br>
                    <br>
                    Some of the recommendations for improving agro-processing were for: improved cultivar varieties availability of local raw
                    materials and other inputs; traceability of raw materials; modern processing equipment such as automatic bottling; easy access to
                    processing centres; adequate processing facilities, commercial settings for processing, better lay-out of processing operations
                    and training in agro-processing; more quality analysis of products, improvement in quality standards, and financial support for
                    meeting the expense of applying food safety management systems such as HACCP and food safety management standards such as ISO
                    22000 and more attractive terms in accessing finance to allow growth of small businesses.<br>

                    Venue: CTA, Wageningen, The Netherlands<br><br>
                    CTA is convinced of the need for evidence based policy and decision making in the ACP region and for building the capacity to do
                    so. Within this context and after endorsement by senior ACP scientists at the 9th and 10th meetings of the Advisory Committee on
                    S&amp;T for ACP Agricultural and Rural Development in 2010 &amp; 2011 respectively, the decision was taken to focus on analysing
                    the ACP postharvest knowledge system as a priority issue.<br>
                    In considering the elements of what constitutes the postharvest knowledge system, there is need for better understanding of the
                    state of postharvest research, knowledge and innovation in the ACP region, the location of centres of knowledge/excellence in
                    teaching and research; their major areas of focus, strengths and weaknesses; status of postharvest handling and processing
                    facilities; engineering and equipment design and development capability as well as packaging facilities and capability. Given the
                    needs, selected country case studies were conducted by focusing on one priority commodity (tracking from field to market) to
                    learn lessons. This CTA expert consultation on postharvest knowledge systems will provide an opportunity for experts from Africa,
                    Caribbean and the Pacific to reflect on the existing situation and design strategic options for the future.<br>

                    CTA plans to host a <b>Policy Learning and Planning workshop/writeshop for Improving the Effectiveness of Extension and Advisory
                    Services</b>. This builds on the knowledge gained from the 2011 Nairobi international conference, the results from the Extension
                    Africa studies and other relevant knowledge sources. In November 2011, CTA in collaboration with several national, regional and
                    international organizations hosted the International Conference on &lsquo;<i>Innovations in Extension and Advisory Services:
                    Linking Knowledge to Policy and Action</i>&rsquo; in Nairobi Kenya. The objective was to take stock of current policies, thinking
                    and practice, successes and failures of ongoing and past reforms in extension and advisory services to specifically address
                    meeting the future needs of small-holder farmers, marginalized communities, women and youth in a sustainable and cost effective
                    manner.<br>
                    CTA also commissioned six case studies on extension and advisory services in Benin, Jamaica, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria and Papua New
                    Guinea. Complementary to the ongoing initiatives, a group of scholars called the 'Africa Extension Reform Group' (AERG), in their
                    determination to strengthen African extension in a systematic manner carried out a study entitled &lsquo;<i>Transforming
                    Agricultural Extension in Africa: A Continent-Wide Study of Agricultural Extension Workers at the Grassroots</i>&rsquo;. The
                    objective was to understand the bottlenecks and make a strong case for an alternative approach to extension programming,
                    organization, and practice in Africa. Several experts from Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific, supported by Professor Volker
                    Hoffmann of Germany, will participate in the CTA policy learning workshop which will serve as a platform for knowledge exchange
                    and charting new areas for further exploration.<br><br>

                    The Vice-Chancellors/Presidents or their nominees of eleven Pacific Islands universities at their meeting on the 9th and 10th of
                    July 2013 at the University of the South Pacific signed an agreement confirming the establishment of the Pacific Islands
                    Universities Research Network (PIURN). One of the goals of PIURN is to provide Science, Technology and Innovation (ST&amp;I) policy advice at the regional and national levels. It will also seek to strengthen research content in the curriculum and in teaching, and develop shared research training initiatives on priority challenges in the Pacific region.<br><br>
                    With a secretariat now funded by the universities themselves, work will begin on two important activities: developing a
                    constitution, and documenting institutional research strengths. The latter priority will involve the collection of data on
                    research in the region, and mapping and auditing of institutional research capacity. This networking initiative was identified as a priority by CTA in their 2012 work programme and supported by the Centre in 2012 and 2013. CTA&rsquo;s Judith Ann Francis, Senior Programme Coordinator, Science and Technology Policy attended the July 2013 PIURN meeting and the 12 Pacific Science Inter-Congress in Fiji.<br><br>

                    The Agriculture and Food Security Network of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation has conducted a quantitative survey
                    with 105 farmers in Benin to study the storage techniques used for dry grains and the main problems encountered during storage.
                    It investigates in more depth the issue of storage losses, their causes and means of improving food conservation in the long
                    term. 59% of the producers of dry grains interviewed reported difficulties in bridging their household needs for dry grains until
                    the next harvest. Producers believe just over half of the food produced by a rural household should be sufficient to prevent
                    hunger among the rural population. Weevils (Sitophilus spp) and other insect pests are responsible for 78.5% of losses. Key
                    issues are the poor availability of storage facilities and suitable packaging material and the lack of pest management knowledge.
                    The document also explores management methods the country&rsquo;s extension system is promoting.<br>

                    Two recent working papers by the World Resources Institute (WRI) are the first in a new series leading to the <i>World Resources
                    Report 2013-14: Creating a Sustainable Food Future</i>. One paper, &lsquo;The great balancing act&rsquo; assesses the scope of
                    the challenge posed by the need to feed a growing population in the near-future while reducing pressure on the environment.
                    Priorities and solutions must focus on poverty alleviation, gender, ecosystems, climate and water, it argues. Another paper,
                    &lsquo;Reducing food loss and waste&rsquo;, explains how efforts to reduce postharvest losses and waste perform against each of
                    the sustainable food future criteria. It offers a thorough overview of waste and loss problems and severity and it describes how
                    changes at the level of the value chain &ndash; some still to be researched and put into practice &ndash; can create immediate
                    benefits to society and the environment.<br>

                    Representatives from across Europe&rsquo;s food supply chain have committed their organisations to reducing edible food waste, in
                    line with the European Commission&rsquo;s goal of halving food waste by 2020. A life-cycle approach is being developed for
                    critical products. In Australia, the study, titled &lsquo;The role of packaging in minimising food waste in the supply chain of
                    the future&rsquo;, from RMIT University in Melbourne focused on where and why food waste occurs both along the fresh and
                    processed food supply. The research identifies opportunities for industry to address food waste through innovative and

                    The Cassava Mechanisation and Agro-processing Project (CAMAP) was launched early July 2013 at the National Centre for
                    Agricultural Mechanisation, Nigeria. Coordinated by the African Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF), CAMAP will enhance the
                    contribution of cassava production and processing technologies for sustainable improvements in food security, incomes and
                    livelihoods of farmers, processors, and marketers in the cassava sector. CAMAP will achieve this through upgrading and expanding
                    traditional planting, harvesting and processing techniques, thus developing competitive cassava commodity value chains for a
                    reliable supply of processed products for food and non-food industrial use.<br>

                    sets out to improve the quality of evening milk and thus the income of the farmers. The solar powered system makes ice at milk
                    collection centres, which the farmer collects and brings home during the day to cool the evening milk before bringing it to the
                    collection point the following day. The system, developed at the Livestock and Irrigation Value chains for Ethiopian Smallholders
                    project, is designed to work on solar and electricity grids. A video on this webpage explains in more details how the cooling

                    Peter Goldsmith, agricultural economist at the University of Illinois, comments on the shortage of storage facilities,
                    particularly private and cooperative, in Brazil grain producing regions. He says 'there is a 34% undercapacity of soybean
                    storage, and the situation is aggravated by the rapidly increasing production of second-crop maize'. Using GIS software to map
                    the coordinates of commercial, cooperative and private grain storage facilities, his research quantified the shortage in storage
                    and identified under-served areas to help planning policy locate appropriate locations for new warehouses. The consequences of
                    the shortage are losses and waste, mainly from the discarded grain left on the fields after harvest and from poor transportation
                    infrastructure. The nature of non-stop, year-round farming in the tropics also contributes to the loss.<br>

                    David Lobell and colleagues at the Center on Food Security and the Environment at Stanford University have analysed exposure of
                    crops to physiologically critical temperatures in the reproductive stage, across the global harvested areas of maize, rice,
                    soybean and wheat. For wheat, higher temperatures accelerate the crop&rsquo;s physiological development, leading to earlier
                    flowering which would reduce the plant&rsquo;s exposure to extreme heat when it is at the reproductive stage. For the three other
                    crops however, higher temperatures have little impact on the physiological development of the plants. Therefore, regardless of
                    the impact of other global change factors (such as increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>), the researchers believe that extreme
                    heat exposure will pose risks for global crop production. Adaptive measures such as changes in sowing dates, crop and variety
                    switching, expansion of irrigation, and agricultural expansion into cooler areas have to be considered when drafting agricultural
                    policy. These results show the importance of specialised data and up-to-date climate models when planning for agricultural
                    adaptation.<br>

                    Three salt-tolerant varieties of dalo (taro), cassava and kumala (sweet potato) that can thrive in Fiji&rsquo;s high-salt water
                    table areas have been introduced to several of the island&rsquo;s rural villages. The Pacific Adaptation to Climate Change (PACC)
                    project and Fiji&rsquo;s Agriculture Ministry are distributing these varieties that can survive severe rainfall in flood-prone
                    landscapes but the institutions are facing supply problems due to the high demand. The regions in which the root crops are
                    distributed are suffering from poor, man-made drainage system that exacerbates the effects of climate change.<br>

                    (of which the Academy is part) aims to sequence the genomes of 96 indigenous orphan crops that are important for African diets
                    (African eggplant, potato, cocoyam, Ethiopian mustard, as well as cassava, cacao, millet, sorghum and legumes, among others).
                    Participating African plant breeders at the new academy will be trained in the most advanced theory and technologies for plant
                    breeding, quantitative genetics, statistics and experimental design, in support of critical decisions for crop improvement.<br>

                    Researcher Angelika Hilbeck at the Institute of Integrative Biology of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology looked into the
                    agricultural seed catalogues available to farmers in countries with different degrees of GM crop adoption (Austria, Germany,
                    Spain, and Switzerland). She and her colleagues estimated how much real-world choice in seeds maize farmers have in each of the
                    countries. The results show that, between 1995 and 2011, in the countries that did not adopt GM crop (Austria, Germany and
                    Switzerland), actual restrictions and regulations of GM crops have not decreased seed choices/cultivar availability for farmers.
                    In contrast, they observed that in Spain, which has adopted GM maize, the seed market was more concentrated with fewer
                    differentiated cultivars on offer: the overall number of maize cultivars declined. The research also plotted the yields over the
                    time period only to note that there was no reduction in yields in non-adopting countries.<br>

                    Indices and maps of global hidden hunger are being developed to help prioritise programme assistance and to serve as an
                    evidence-based global advocacy tool. In this research paper, Sumithra Muthayya of Sax Institute Sydney, Australia together with
                    specialists from both the non-profit and for-profit nutrition sectors, creates two types of hidden hunger indices and maps (using
                    data on stunting, anaemia, retinol levels and estimates of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) attributed to micronutrient
                    deficiencies). Of note, occurrence of iodine deficiency did not conform to that of other micronutrients (it mainly occurs in
                    developed countries). The study demonstrates how these indices and maps provide crucial data for tackling global multiple
                    micronutrient deficiencies and could help to scale up effective nutrition interventions.<br>

                    Iodine deficiency affects two billion people worldwide. This experiment conducted by the PlantLab, Italy and the private company
                    SQM S.A., Chile evaluated the possibility of biofortifying tomato fruits with iodine. Results showed that the use of iodised
                    salts induced a significant increase in the fruit&rsquo;s iodine content in doses that did not affect plant growth and
                    development. This suggests that the tomato is a particularly suitable crop for iodine biofortification programmes. The pattern
                    and magnitude of iodine deficiency does not conform to that of other micronutrients. The greatest proportions of children with
                    iodine deficiency are in the Eastern Mediterranean (46.6%), European (44.2%), and African (40.4%) regions. The daily Dietary
                    Reference Intake (USA) for iodine is between 110 &micro;g for infants and 290 &micro;g for lactating mothers. Some foods are
                    naturally rich in iodine: beans, potatoes (with skin), gray (rock) salt, sea vegetables (kelp), and yoghurt.<br>

                    In a recent Comment in <i>Nature</i>, Cornell University plant geneticist Susan McCouch and colleagues says that the biodiversity
                    stored in plant gene banks coupled with advances in genetics and plant breeding may hold the keys for meeting the challenge of
                    climate change, soil degradation and water and land shortages. Though seeds are readily accessible in 1,700 gene banks, it is
                    difficult for breeders to make use of the wealth of genetic material in seed banks because of a lack of information about the
                    genes in most plants and the traits they confer. The paper outlines a plan to address these constraints: 1) a massive genetic
                    sequencing effort on seed-bank holdings; 2) a broad phenotyping initiative; 3) an internationally accessible informatics
                    infrastructure.<br>

                    Professor David Hume, Director of The Roslin Institute at the Universty of Edinburgh, UK looks at the challenge to meet the
                    demand for animal products whilst at the same time reducing the overall environmental impact. According to Hume, it is very
                    unlikely that existing genetic variation in animals will continue to generate the rate of gain in size or offspring number, for
                    example, obtained in the past. So a different kind of genetically-modified animal will be required. Hume believes that
                    &lsquo;transgenesis&rsquo; (genetic engineering) to produce desired traits is possible and could provide clear benefits to the
                    consumer in terms of cost, health, animal welfare and environment if regulatory requirements were based upon science rather than
                    assertion. He concludes that sustainable gains in productivity of livestock will only be achieved if governments recognise that
                    the required research is a &lsquo;public good&rsquo;, and re-enter and re-engage with the livestock research sector with
                    substantial investment.<br>

                    A team of plant breeders led by Fetien Abay of Mekelle University in Ethiopia and &Aring;smund Bj&oslash;rnstad of the Norwegian
                    University of Life Sciences followed an approach called participatory plant breeding to select the varieties of barley most
                    adapted for the preparation of injera (a very popular bread in Ethiopia). They found that, if cooked in the traditional way,
                    injera prepared with barley from a variety that is a cross between the Himblil and Saesa variety, scored very high among the
                    Ethiopian tasters.<br>
                    <br>
                    Editors&rsquo;comments: Production of Teff, one of the earliest plants to be domesticated and the grain of which is traditionally
                    used in Ethiopia for the preparation of injera, while no disaggregated stats exists, is almost two times that of barley in
                    Ethiopia (FAO stats, HarvestChoice). It is also high in dietary fibre, iron, and provides calcium and protein. A question for
                    scientists/breeders and policymakers to ponder: While the cheaper injera made from barley is comparable taste wise, how does it
                    compare on nutritional content? Another issue is that teff is adapted to numerous environments; drought stressed and water
                    logged. Are the barley varieties similarly adapted?<br>

                    In his presentation, Fran&ccedil;ois M&uuml;nger, Head of the Global Programme on Water Initiatives at SDC, details the barriers
                    to linking research, policy and practice, such as: Low recognition and rating of practice and policy influence in an academic
                    cursus; Difference of timing between research and political rhythms which limits the possibility to take advantage of the
                    political opportunities; Results often presented to potential users at the end of research project. According to him,
                    trans-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder approaches can further innovation by connecting researchers to larger networks or
                    introduce them to trans-disciplinary approaches that can help them think out of the box. Research partnership is an important
                    strategic option to connect policy and research.<br>

                    patterns across 27 scientific knowledge domains (8 of which can be directly related to the agricultural research). It details
                    publication patterns over ten years, the number of research papers produced per year per country, the nature of international
                    collaboration in multi-author publications, etc. Strengths and weakness are identified which can be used to inform future
                    decision-making processes. Although Africa&rsquo;s contribution to the world of scientific publications remains low, the results
                    indicate that the number of scientific publications is growing while international corporation remains almost the same.<br>

                    Based on discussions held at a workshop in 2012, the report tries to map the concepts behind the idea of &lsquo;sustainable

                    This project coordinated by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) shows that village-owned
                    plantations of high-value timber trees, mainly teak (<i>Tectona grandis</i>) and mahogany (<i>Swietenia macrophylla</i>) in the
                    Solomon Islands can benefit from interplanting with the indigenous tree <i>Flueggea flexuosa</i> and other tree species native to
                    the Pacific region. The rationale behind this interplanting is that commercial plantations must always be thinned and removing
                    young timbers trees that cannot be sold offers no practical advantages. However, thinning the plantations by only removing
                    indigenous tree species can benefit the villagers in many ways: with fruits and other tree products, firewood, and construction
                    materials.<br>
