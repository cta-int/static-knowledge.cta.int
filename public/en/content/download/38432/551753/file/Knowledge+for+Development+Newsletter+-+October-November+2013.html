Commercial and farmers&rsquo; seed systems exist next to each other. What are the opportunities for innovation of the seed sector and who will benefit from science and technology? Are indigenous seeds and genetic resources under threat? How can African smallholders benefit from integrated seed systems? What is needed to support integrated seed sector development?<br>
                    <br>
                    This folder examines research and policy needs for developing an integrated seed system in the ACP region. The two lead articles focus on experiences in the African region. Fetien Abay, from Mekelle University, Ethiopia describes the need for policy and institutional support to develop an integrated seed system that serves African smallholders. She discusses the enhanced role that public universities can play in this regard. Michael Waithaka and Miriam Kyotalimye, from the Association for Strengthening Agricultural Research in Eastern and Central Africa (ASARECA), write about harmonising seed policy in this region. They share the lessons from a public-private partnership model that evolved to address the challenge of gaps in policy and practice regarding production and trade in seed across 11 countries in the region. Besides publications on research and policy needs, the supporting background documents and web links to this folder contain descriptions of experiences and initiatives that relate to capacity development, outreach, and investment needs from a range of different stakeholders in the seed sector.<br>

MU works with farmers, consumers, other public institutions and private companies to develop interventions using seeds of local crops as opposed to the varieties (e.g. hybrid maize) that are favoured by commercial enterprises involved in the formal seed sector. Several factors limit access to improved seed for African smallholders: Poorly developed infrastructure, Inadequate extension services, Inadequate seed policies.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Mekelle University seed programme has established a strong farmer-researcher linkage, in which the importance of farmer-breeders is recognised. The farmers&rsquo; right of full access to enhance varieties as well as for a partial ownership of breeding rights (including the recognition of farmer-selected and officially released varieties) was secured from the start. The Ethiopian Plant Breeders&rsquo; Right Proclamation also recognises farmers&rsquo; rights.<br>
                    <br>
                    MU carried out a wide range of mutually reinforcing activities including: (i) participatory plant breeding (PPB); (ii) a joint vision and a regular discussion forum have been established;(iii) collaboration among stakeholders for the multiplication and distribution of early generation seed (EGS), variety development, registration and release of faba bean and barley was strengthened; (iv) capacity building at several levels; (vi) improvement of local food products (vi) provision of seed-cleaning machines; and (vii) dissemination of results.<br>
                    <br>
                    Public universities need to consider how to: assist seed-insecure subsistence farmers who may be unable to purchase seed and; better identify and distribute improved varieties of indigenous and lesser known crops for which there is little commercial interest.<br>

This article discusses how EASCOM was formed, its mandate, operational mechanisms and achievements, and reviews how EASCOM prioritised the agenda for seed policy harmonisation and the factors and resources that were harnessed to generate successful outcomes. The Association for Strengthening Agricultural Research in Eastern and Central Africa (ASARECA) in 1999 analysed the status of seed sector policy in eastern and central Africa and concluded that enactment and implementation of harmonised seed policies, regulations and procedures was needed. The initiative initially focused on Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Other countries were also engaged, but primarily as observers in regional workshops.<br>
                    <br>
                    Papers were commissioned for each pilot country detailing policy options to: facilitate the unrestricted movement of seed and other germplasm across national borders; create a regional market for seeds to allow economies of scale and scope in seed production; attract investments in seed multiplication and distribution; and, improve service delivery of seeds to farmers and reviewed. From this evidence, stakeholders representing the private sector, breeders, regulators and policy makers from the pilot countries and observers from the non-pilot countries agreed on cross-cutting issues for rationalisation at country level and harmonisation at the regional level.<br>
                    <br>
                    By 2002, limited progress in anticipated reforms had been achieved, mainly due to an imbalance in representation which favoured breeders in the seed regional working group. While harmonisation focused on getting countries to agree on key areas affecting the formal seeds sector, the informal sector was not neglected. For example, the Tanzania Seed Law of 2003 recognises farm-saved seeds through a quality-declared system.<br>
                    <br>
                    EASCOM was established in 2004 with a more balanced public-private partnership. The organisation brought together representatives of the private sector through the national seed trade association; the technical arm through the national breeders&rsquo; association; the regulatory arm through the national seed certification agency, and the policy arm through the ministry of agriculture. EASCOM&rsquo;s mandate and responsibilities include: review of seed policies, laws and regulations; strengthening of national seed and plant breeders&rsquo; associations; operationalisation of harmonised agreements; development and maintenance of databases; capacity building; seed market development and representation in regional economic blocs.<br>
                    <br>
                    EASCOM&rsquo;s efforts at seed policy harmonisation can provide lessons and be used to derive best practices for other regions. Key elements are: (i) facilitation of partnerships (+Dialogue +Participation +Transparency); and (ii) recognition of the differences (+Technical and legislative expertise +Diversity of knowledge).<br>

                            Whereas agrobiodiversity conservation has received much attention from researchers and policymakers over the last decades, the methods available to study the role of seed exchange networks in preserving crop biodiversity have only recently begun to be considered. In this overview, the authors present key concepts, methods, and challenges to better understand seed exchange networks so as to improve the chances that traditional crop varieties (landraces) will be preserved and used sustainably around the world.<br>

                            Low potato yields in Kenya: Do conventional input innovations account for the yields disparity?
                          </h3>
                          <p style="margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; font-size:14px;">
                            Potato yields in Kenya are less than half the amount obtained by some developed countries. Despite more acreage being dedicated to the crop, annual production has not improved. Kenya's low yields have been blamed on a failure to use clean seeds, fertilisers, fungicides and irrigation. The article examines the impact of adopting these innovations on enhancements of yields. Whereas adoption of the inputs is important, there is a need to use precise, recommended application regimes in order to obtain better potato yields. Training, in the form of visits by propagation agents, are shown to improve adoption rates although only about half (55%) of farmers reported receiving such visits in the preceding three years.<br>

                            Alongside its importance in production, food security and rural development, seed is a key element in many debates about technology development and transfer, biodiversity, globalisation and equity. The sustainable availability of good quality seed is thus an important development issue. This study deals with the impact different types of regulation have on how farmers access seed. This thesis builds on the author&rsquo;s earlier work on seed systems, seed laws, intellectual property and genetic resource policies.<br>

                            Drawing on lessons from country-case studies from Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi and Zimbabwe, as well as insights from a set of complementary studies of cross-cutting themes, this article assesses the evolution of seed system research and development programmes and processes across the region. By examining how the contrasting politics and different configurations of interests affect the way cereal seed systems operate, it highlights opportunities for reshaping the terms of the debate and opening up alternative pathways to more sustainable and socially just seed systems.<br>

                            Farmers in sub-Saharan Africa demonstrate diverse seed demand behaviour. One key goal in characterising Nigerian farmers&rsquo; seed demand is improving the public sector&lsquo;s ability to predict which of them are likely to adopt new and improved varieties in the foreseeable future given their agroecological and socio-economic situations. This review focuses primarily on the demand for improved seeds of rice, cowpea, and maize.<br>

                            The professionalisation of breeding and its separation from farming leads to the emergence of a commercial seeds system, alongside farmers&rsquo; seeds systems through which farmers traditionally save, exchange and sell seeds, often informally. This shift has led to temporary monopoly privileges being granted to plant breeders and patent-holders through the tools of intellectual property, as a means to encourage research and innovation in plant breeding. In this process, however, the poorest farmers may become increasingly dependent on expensive inputs, creating the risk of indebtedness in the face of unstable incomes. This report explores how States could implement seed policies that contribute to the full realisation of human rights.<br>

                            African countries embarked on privatisation of their seed industries in the 1980s as part of the structural adjustment programmes. Botswana, however, chose not to privatise its seed production services at that time. This paper examines the prospects and challenges for embarking on seed sector privatisation in developing countries using Botswana as a case study.<br>

A revised strategy for conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources for food and agriculture in South Africa has extended its focus from just <i>ex situ</i> national collections to also include <i>in situ</i> conservation, to be supported by community seed banks. The team also arranged seed fairs, carried out historical analyses of crop use, four-cell analysis for crops and crop varieties and seed network mapping. South Africa is one of the first countries in the world to support community seed banks through a national policy.<br>

                            Farmer-led seed enterprises on African indigenous vegetables are contributing towards food and nutrition security through crop diversification, as well as the improvement of livelihoods through income earned from seed businesses. The success of farmer-led seed enterprise models on African indigenous vegetables is based on building good partnerships with a wide range of institutions/organisations for identifying, establishing and training seed growers groups. Building partnerships around these institutional linkages has been essential for the success of these projects.<br>

                            This study uses a value-chain framework to examine the challenges and opportunities for sorghum, millet and maize in Zambia. Based on information from 130 smallholder farmers, 57 seed dealers, five private seed companies, and two research institutions, the study shows that despite new market opportunities, development and release of improved varieties was very slow owing to policy and institutional constraints. Productivity enhancements were also impeded by poor access to high-yielding seed varieties and fertiliser. Such constraints need to be addressed to ensure productivity gains.<br>

                            This paper examines the effect of variety attributes on adoption of improved sorghum varieties in Kenya. The results show that improved varieties had desirable production and marketing attributes, while local varieties were perceived to have the best consumption attributes. The findings imply that, while developing improved seed varieties, breeders should also focus on non-yield attributes like taste and ease of cooking. Further, it is important that both producers and consumers of sorghum be involved in the seed evaluation process.

                            This book by IFPRI investigates how this tool might be effectively used to evaluate the benefits, costs, and risks for African countries in adopting GM crops. The authors gather together studies on the economic effects and impact on trade of GM crops, how consumers view such crops, and other issues. They find that GM crops have had, on average, a positive economic effect in the African nations (Burkina Faso, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda) where they were used and identify future steps for enhancing their adoption. Promising policy initiatives include making biosafety regulations that do not make the development prohibitively expensive, fostering intraregional trade in GM crops, and providing more and better information about GM crops to consumers who might currently be sceptical of them.<br>

                            A crucial condition for the &lsquo;high dose/refuge&rsquo; strategy to delay the evolution of resistance to <i>Bt</i> crops in pest populations, is that, to be efficient, the inheritance of resistance trait should be functionally recessive. A team of researchers from the <i>Institut de Recherche pour le D&eacute;velopment</i> (IRD, France), ICIPE (Kenya) and North-West University (South Africa) tested the nature (allelic dominance or recessiveness) of the inheritance of the resistance trait. <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0069675">Results</a> show that resistance of <i>B. fusca</i> to <i>Bt</i> corn is dominant, which refutes the hypothesis of recessive inheritance. Survival on <i>Bt</i> corn was not lower than on non-<i>Bt</i> corn for both resistant larvae and the F1 progeny from resistant &times; susceptible parents. Hence, resistance management strategies of <i>B. fusca</i> to <i>Bt</i> corn must address non-recessive resistance.<br>

                            Patrick Brown, an assistant professor in plant breeding and genetics at the University of Illinois College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences (ACES), and his team have completed the first comprehensive genomic analysis of the molecular changes behind the adaptation of sorghum lines grown in temperate climates decades ago. The researchers used a new technique called genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to map genetic differences in 1160 sorghum lines. Having a complete characterisation of the locations (loci) affecting specific traits will speed up the adaptation of sorghum and other related grasses to new production systems for both food and fuel.<br>

                            This news report by IPS shows how drastic changes in the weather of Trinidad and Tobago affect root crops, and how the farmers who grow them, are suffering from delayed and scarce but heavier rain. Root crops under these weather conditions grow more slowly but fields of cowpea are destroyed. While hindering the development of winged insect pest, the changes in rain intensity render pesticide application almost useless. Even more worrying is the proliferation of fungus and bacteria. Solutions exist though: better soil management offers a quick fix, but on the longer term, the region must do better to collect, preserve and improve the local germplasm so as to develop deter adapted crops.<br>

                            In a recent report, published in a special issue of <i>Economics</i>, the projected changes in planted area, yield per area, net exports/imports and prices for five major agricultural crops in South Africa were simulated using the projections of four Global Circulation Models (GCMs) under three socio-economic scenarios. The results indicate slightly rising to stable yields per unit area up to 2050, despite climate change, largely due to the inbuilt assumption of ongoing agronomic and genetic improvements. Policies to increase local agricultural production in South Africa, decrease climate sensitivity and access to international markets are highlighted.<br>

The authors examined the risk-governance approach used during the approval process, comparing it to best practices in regulatory settings, including risk-assessment practices developed by the National Research Council. Recommendations made can also apply to similar agencies in ACP countries: develop comprehensive testing datasets, perform cumulative risk assessments, better utilise the peer-reviewed literature.<br>

                            One West-African dwarf cattle breed, the Baoul&eacute;, seems less affected by trypanosomosis than others. The scientists behind the discovery have developed a method that can identify the parasites responsible for trypanosomosis and can even detect three different forms of the parasite in a single step. The information is extremely valuable to veterinarians and farmers as each type of trypanosome causes a slightly different disease progression and requires a different type of treatment. The researchers used their new method to examine samples of blood from apparently healthy Baoul&eacute; cattle, Indian Zebu cattle and crosses between the two breeds. It seems that the Baoul&eacute;'s immune system can tolerate higher levels of the blood parasite. When they are infected, Baoul&eacute; cattle develop fever and lose weight but do not necessarily die.<br>
