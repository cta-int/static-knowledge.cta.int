By Christoplos I., Danish Institute for International Studies for the FAO and the Global forum for rural advisory services, 2010.<br />
This <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/012/i1444e/i1444e.pdf" target="_blank"><u>paper</u></a> presents an overview of current opportunities and challenges facing efforts to increase the impact of rural and agricultural extension. The &#39;extension services&#39; described here may just as likely consist of an input vendor advising a farmer about what seed to plant, a television station broadcasting a weather forecast, a supermarket advising traders about what standards are required for the vegetables they purchase or a farmer organization lobbying for research that reflects the demands of its members for new technologies. Mobilizing the potential of extension is about enhancing this broad and complex flow of information and advice in the agrifood sector. The ideas presented here describe how extension systems can contribute to the improvement of the profitability, sustainability and equity of smallholder agriculture within broader innovation systems.

<img align="left" width="125" height="100" style="margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px" src="http://knowledge.cta.int/var/knowledge/storage/images/dossiers/s-t-policy-making/s-t-policy-dialogue/articles/acp-and-eu-policymakers-want-evidence-that-science-can-and-will-deliver-the-chicken-and-the-egg/337053-1-eng-GB/ACP-and-EU-policymakers-want-evidence-that-science-can-and-will-deliver-the-chicken-and-the-egg_contentfront.jpg">

Science is a critical instrument for growth and development. Such is the policy rhetoric of many ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) nations and their counterparts in the European Union (EU). The Heads of State of the African Union, for example, dedicated their 2007 Summit to the theme of science and technology (S&T) and its contribution to Africa&#39;s development (African Union, 2007), and have subsequently (at regular intervals) endorsed efforts to implement "Africa&#39;s Science and Technology Consolidated Plan of Action" (New Partnership for Africa&#39;s Development (NEPAD), 2005). Science and innovation is also at the heart of the EU&#39;s "Europe 2020" strategy for sustainable growth (European Commission, 2010). In recent years, for example, emphasis has been given to ensuring a greater focus on research and innovation as part of the spending priorities of the EU&#39;s structural and regional funds, instruments targeted at boosting economic growth in the EU&#39;s less-developed regions. <br /><br />
This article will interrogate whether the apparent policy consensus on "science for development" has translated into the ACP-EU partnership being leveraged in a concerted manner to exploit the potential of science to enrich development cooperation between the ACP and the EU, i.e. in the manner which policymakers often declare to be "objective". The assessment will briefly review developments in this regard over the past ten years, examining whether ACP and EU policymakers are indeed convinced, as their policy pronouncements would suggest, that science can and will deliver, and whether they are consequently prioritizing a focus on science as part of their cooperation programmes. In conclusion, looking to the future, the role of a strengthened ACP-EU S&T policy dialogue in enhancing science for development initiatives will be considered.

	A new project on climate change mitigation and agricultural projects in Latin America and the Caribbean has been launched, which will bring together a consortium of research institutions and funders. The Government of New Zealand, the Inter-American Development Bank and the Regional Fund for Agricultural Technology (Fontagro, for its initials in Spanish) have signed an agreement to work together for the first time on a project to improve national greenhouse gas inventories and develop mitigation options in LAC. The research will be adapted to the farming conditions of each of the target countries: Argentina, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Uruguay.

	New modelling work by an Agricultural Research Service (ARS, the research arm of the U.S Department of Agriculture, USDA) team, suggests that a dairy cow living year-round outdoors may leave a markedly smaller negative ecological impact than sheltered dairy cows. The team used the &#39;<a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/Main/docs.htm?docid=8519" target="_blank"><u>Integrated Farm System Model</u></a>)&#39;,  a computer program that simulates the major biological and physical processes and interactions on a crop, beef, or dairy farm. The researchers found that total emissions for the greenhouse gases methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide were 8 percent lower in year-round outdoor production systems than in the high-production confinement systems. Keeping dairy cows outdoors all year lowered ammonia emissions by about 30 percent and helped reduce fuel use and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions from farm equipment.

	In the <a href="https://www.agronomy.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/40/3/907" target="_blank"><u>May-June 2011</u></a> issue of the Journal of Environmental Quality, a team led by Mark Powell, a soil scientist with the USDA Agricultural Research Service&#39;s U.S. Dairy Forage Research Center in Madison, Wisconsin, describes how natural plant compounds known as tannins can reduce both the amount of nitrogen cows excrete in urine, and the action of a microbial enzyme in manure that converts the nitrogen into ammonia on the barn floor. Feeding tannins to cattle could not only help dairy farmers reduce these impacts and meet regulatory standards, but tannins could also boost nitrogen use efficiency in cows, thereby decreasing the need for expensive protein supplements. Tannins are perhaps best known for their role in leather tanning, but Powell began investigating them in ruminant feed more than two decades ago in West Africa. In the communities where he worked, tannin-rich shrubs were grown as windbreaks, and to amend the soil and feed livestock. Tannins in the diets of cattle, sheep and goats are in fact well-studied in the tropics, where the vegetation tends to be naturally higher in the astringent plant chemicals, Powell explains. The tannin sources investigated in the study are already approved for animal feed, and &#39;the levels we used amount to pennies per cow per day&#39;. (ARS, 5/2011) <br />

	Papua New Guinea&#39;s potato industry suffers from the potato late blight (PLB, Phytophthora infestans). The Sequoia, PNG&#39;s most common potato variety, is highly susceptible to PLB. After a devastating outbreak in 2003, only commercial farmers who could afford fungicides, portable sprayers and potato seeds did continue to grow the crop. However, smallholders farmers on the islands could not afford to buy the standard remedial to the blight. Especially for the farmers living at higher altitude, potato was an important cash and subsistence crop. In May 2011, PNG&#39;s National Agricultural Research Institute released two late blight resistant potato varieties, the product of a large-scale project that start started in 2003 with the assistance of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR). Blight resistant potato seeds are now distributed to farmers, who are also offered training on integrated late blight management for existing and new potato cultivars.

	Surya Nath of PNG&#39;s National Agricultural Research Institute (NARI) discusses the need for farm mechanisation PNG. The author gives a broad account of PNG&#39;s agricultural sector, defining the limits to and the challenges of building a more dynamic agricultural sector on the islands. One of the author main points is the need to promote at the farm level the adoption of more modern, albeit low-cost, machinery. Empowering farmers with better cultivation tools and post-harvest apparatus will help them reach a production level that would rival with countries from continental south-east Asia. To blame for the lack machinery on the field is the non-existent &#39;machinery&#39; policy (or, in other words, the lack of vision for agricultural development on the island). This discussion gives the reader a good overview of the current situation of agriculture in PNG, and a solid starting point for more debate on what PNG needs to develop its agriculture.

	This <a href="http://www.unapcaem.org/publication/Pub_AM2010.htm" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a> examines the interactions among agricultural mechanization, food production and agricultural development of the Asia-Pacific region. Six countries were chosen for case studies, namely Bangladesh, China, India, Republic of Korea, Thailand and the Philippines, representing different stages of agricultural mechanization. Through visits and talks with policy makers, researchers and the private sector in the six countries, and thorough review of country reports prepared by representatives to the Technical Committee of United Nations Asian and Pacific Centre for Agricultural Engineering and Machinery (UNAPCAEM), the authors have collected extensive data and information on agricultural mechanization, and conducted thorough analysis. The study identifies the main characteristics of agricultural mechanization of each country, and assesses their respective needs in agricultural mechanization. The study also explores the feasibility of establishing an &#39;Asia Pacific Network for Testing Agricultural Machinery&#39; (ANTAM). The feasibility study on the establishment of ANTAM is an important part of this report. ANTAM is proposed with an aim to promote introduction of uniform testing procedures and safety standards of agricultural machinery, and facilitate intraregional trade.

	Satellite and aerial imagery play a significant role in modern day agricultural production and forest related activities. T he primary value of satellite and airborne imagery to agriculture and forestry is two-fold. Firstly, imagery provides valuable information that is useful for planning and managing the potential crop output, in a sustainable way. Imagery results in more sustainable food production. Secondly, imagery enables the gathering of knowledge about agriculture and forestry through local to regional to global scales. That knowledge enables a better understanding of overall production factors, but also contributes toward risk management decisions and supports predictive modelling of food supply and consumption. This article gives a thorough account of the applications of satellite imagery and GIS used in the agriculture and forestry sectors.

	This <a href="http://www.bioversityinternational.org/nc/publications/publication/issue/payments_for_agrobiodiversity_conservation_servicesnbspfor_sustained_on_farm_utilization_of_plant.html"target="_blank"><u>paper</u></a> discusses the potential application of Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES)-like schemes to tackle market failures associated with the public good characteristics of agrobiodiversity conservation services. So called payments for agrobiodiversity conservation services (PACS) would increase the private benefits from utilizing local plant and animal genetic resources on-farm through voluntary reward mechanisms, so as to sustain their on-farm conservation. PACS may be understood as a sub-category of agriculture related PES that focuses on socially valuable and threatened local plant and animal genetic resources (PAGR). This paper discusses theoretical and applied insights about PACS to shed light on the potential of PACS to serve as a least-cost and pro-poor PAGR conservation incentive scheme.

	By The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); May 2011.<br />
	This <a href="http://www.fao.org/ag/save-and-grow/index_en.html" target="_blank"><u>book</u></a> was produced under the direction of Shivaji Pandey, Director of FAO&#39;s Plant Production and Protection Division and presents a new paradigm: sustainable crop production intensification (SCPI). SCPI rationale is to help produce more from the same area of land while conserving resources, reducing negative impacts on the environment and enhancing natural capital and the flow of ecosystem services. Green techniques for sustainable agriculture are put together in this book under a number of chapters: Farming systems, Soil health, Crops and varieties, Water management, Plant protection, and Policies and Institutions. This book is not only the statement of a new paradigm of agriculture from the FAO: it is also a guide to practical working solutions for a more ecologically and socially sustainable agriculture.

	This is the <a href="http://www.bioversityinternational.org/nc/publications/publication/issue/collaborative_and_participatory_approaches_to_cocoa_variety_improvement-1.html" target="_blank"><u>final report</u></a> of the CFC/ICCO/Bioversity project on &#39;Cocoa Productivity and quality improvement: a Participatory Approach&#39; that spanned form 2004 to 2010. It summarizes the outcomes of the Closing Workshop of the above mentioned CFC/ICCO/Bioversity project on cocoa productivity and quality, convened at the end of May 2010 in Accra, Ghana. The workshop formally marked the conclusion of the project that was launched in June 2004, but which was building on the achievements of the CFC/ICCO/IPGRI project on &#39;Cocoa Germplasm Utilization and Conservation: a Global Approach&#39; implemented between 1998 and 2004. Thus many of the results presented here reflect the work done over a long period of time.  This document presents the results and benefits of the project, and an evaluation of the International Clone Trial and disease resistance studies; it also compiles country reports on cocoa for a number of ACP countries: Trinidad and Tobago, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Papua New Guinea, Ghana and Nigeria).

	The <a href="http://www.worldfishcenter.org/resource_centre/WF_2799.pdf" target="_blank"><u>findings</u></a> from the ACIAR project Aquaculture and food security in Solomon Islands are published in the policy report by the WorldFish Center. One species of tilapia was introduced in the 1950&#39;S but current trends show that this particular tilapia species (<i>Oreochromis mossambicus</i>) and related farming systems are insufficient to meet future fish demand. Findings suggest the farming of native fish species, milkfish (<i>Chanos Chanos</i>), could help meet predicted demand for fish. It is noted that both tilapia and milkfish farming need more research and risk assements studies, notably if the Solomon Islands is to import and farm a different species of tilapia, the Nile variety (<i>Oreochromis niloticus</i>).

	Organic fruit and vegetables contain on average 12 per cent more health-promoting compounds than conventionally grown produce, scientists at Newcastle University have found. The <a href="http://www.ncl.ac.uk/afrd/research/publication/168871 " target="_blank"><u>study</u></a>, published in the academic journal Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences, reveals that organic crops contain significantly higher levels of secondary metabolites (compounds that are believed to protect us against a range of diseases including obesity) than conventionally-grown crops. The team, based in the university&#39;s School of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, reviewed all the published research on secondary metabolites and vitamin C in fruits and vegetables produced using organic or conventional methods.

	Quantifying household dependence on multiple environmental resources such as forests, bush, grasslands and rivers is particularly difficult and often simply ignored in these surveys. This <a href="http://www.earthscan.co.uk/?tabid=102458" target="_blank"><u>book</u></a> describes how to do a better job when designing and implementing household and village surveys for quantitative assessment of rural livelihoods in developing countries. The book draws heavily on the <a href="http://www.cifor.cgiar.org/pen/" target="_blank"><u>Poverty Environment Network</u></a> experiences, and is a major output of the PEN project. The book deals with the entire research process from vague research ideas, formulation of specific hypotheses, data needs, design of surveys and questionnaire, data collection, data management and analysis to presentation of results; it is enriched by numerous practical examples from the field.

	By Cotula, L., IIED, London, 2011.<br />
	The <a href="http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/12568IIED.pdf" target="_blank"><u>report</u></a> was prepared for &#39;Legal tools for citizen empowerment&#39;, a programme steered by the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED). It analyses 12 land deals and their wider legal frameworks. A number of the contracts reviewed appear to be short, unspecific documents that grant long-term rights to extensive areas of land, and in some cases priority rights over water, in exchange for seemingly little public revenue and/or apparently vague promises of investment and/or jobs. Also, a number of the deals are being negotiated in legal contexts where safeguards for local interests are weak, and some contracts appear not to properly address social and environmental issues. Some contracts do however feature better terms: such as better distributed revenues, international social and environmental on-farm standards, more flexible duration, clearer identification of the land being transacted, specific investor commitments on jobs, training, local procurement and local processing, greater attention to local food security, and their tighter social and environmental safeguards.

	By Hebebrand C., Policy Paper Series, International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council (IPC), May 2011.<br />
	This study was commissioned by the <a href="http://www.thechicagocouncil.org/globalagdevelopment/" target="_blank"><u>Global Agricultural Development Initiative</u></a> and sponsored by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. It examines the role transnational corporations (TNCs) play in the funding, via direct investments, of the agricultural sector in developing countries. This policy paper consists of four sections. The first reiterates the benefits of sound private-sector investment in sustainable food security; it also explains the paper&#39;s primary focus on investments from TNCs and describes how TNCs approach decisions on investment allocations. The second section highlights examples of TNC investments that have simultaneously benefited smallholders in developing countries while creating profits for the investors. The third section explores how the US government engages with TNCs and incentivizes investments. The final section concludes with recommendations for TNCs, governments, and other players, with a view towards increasing TNC investments that both strengthen agricultural development and offer profits to TNCs.

	The Better Cotton Initiative (<a href="http://www.bettercotton.org/" target="_blank"><u>BCI</u></a>) is an international membership association made up of cotton retailers, producers, and non-profit groups, working in Pakistan, India, Brazil, and West & Central Africa (Benin, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso) to promote sustainable cotton cultivation that is less damaging to the health of farmers and the environment. BCI aims to promote measurable improvements in the key environmental and social impacts of cotton cultivation worldwide to make it more economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable. Since 2005, the BCI has been working with organisations from across the cotton supply chain and interested stakeholders to facilitate a sustainable solution for the mainstream cotton sector. The BCI&#39;s philosophy is to develop a market for a new mainstream commodity (ie., similar to a brand name): &#39;Better Cotton&#39;. The &#39;brand&#39; aims to become the sustainable alternative to common cotton and bring long-term benefits for the environment, farmers and other people dependent on cotton for their livelihood.

	HarvestPlus seeks to reduce &#39;hidden hunger&#39; (micronutrient malnutrition) and provide micronutrients to billions of people directly through the staple foods that they eat. It uses a novel process called biofortification to breed higher levels of micronutrients directly into key staple foods. <a href="http://www.harvestplus.org/" target="_blank"><u>HarvestPlus</u></a> focuses on three critical micronutrients that are recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as most limiting in diets: iron, zinc, and vitamin A. HarvestPlus envisions that in fifteen years, millions of people suffering from micronutrient malnutrition will be eating new biofortified crop varieties. The HarvestPlus initiative is one of the three &#39;challenge&#39; programme of the CGIAR. It was officially launched in 2004. It is a good source of information on developments and projects related to micronutrient security and biofortification around the world.
