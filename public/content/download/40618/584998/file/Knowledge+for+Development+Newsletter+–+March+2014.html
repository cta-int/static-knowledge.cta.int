Increased investments in STI and a convergence of policy, science and society, is necessary to reach sustainable development goals. Since 2000, many global initiatives for harnessing STI for development have been launched but they have not necessarily resulted in substantial improvements in the circumstances of the poor in developing countries. <br><br>To make significant progress, shared ownership of the global agenda as well as having the requisite STI implementation capacity, are essential. Interaction among governments, knowledge institutes and the productive/business sector must improve and the barriers &ndash; namely general mistrust, limited capacity, inadequate and restrictive funding and an inability of the research communities to convince decision-makers that past investments have societal relevance &ndash; must be minimized if not removed. ACP governments must have confidence to go against the <i>status quo</i>, while ensuring that the global agenda is shaped and owned at national and local level.<br>

                    Strengthening science, technology and innovation policy processes in Africa

                  <p style="margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; font-size:15px;">
                    <i>By John Ouma-Mugabe, University of Pretoria, South Africa</i><br>
                    <br>
                    In the beginning of the 21st century, after many years of limited interest in research for development, many African countries initiated projects to design national policies for science, technology and innovation (STI). Now, a decade later, at least 37 African countries, have adopted new STI policy regimes or will do so soon. Countries that have implemented new STI policy regimes include Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Lesotho, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Gabon, Rwanda, South Africa, Uganda, Nigeria, and Zimbabwe.<br>
                    <br>
                    This resurgence of interest in STI policy was triggered by several factors. First, African politicians began to appreciate the role that STI could play in the socio-economic development of their countries. Second, public support for STI gained in strength. And third, a number of regional, continental and international initiatives promoting STI policy development in Africa have been launched in the past 10 years. However, African governments face a plethora of challenges. As a consequence, the institutional infrastructure for STI policy research, analysis and public policy making is generally weak in most African countries. If African governments truly wish to reap the benefits of STI for socio-economic development in their countries, they urgently need to address these capacity gaps. This is also true for countries in the Caribbean and the Pacific region.<br>

                    Innovation systems and capability building of smallholder farmers: Innovating for increased market access
                  </h3>
                  <p style="margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; font-size:15px;">
                    <i>By Maurice Bolo, The Scinnovent Centre, Nairobi, Kenya</i><br>
                    <br>
                    Increased competition, discerning consumer tastes, stringent regulations and technological changes continue to put pressure on farmers to innovate and compete to access new markets. Smallholder farmers have to undergo a very steep learning and adaptation curve to survive. New knowledge is the centre piece of market survival and yet, their 'knowledge puzzle' is incomplete. Smallholder farmers have to rely on other actors within the innovation system to develop the capabilities needed to 'sense and seize new opportunities' in the market. Because most farmers cannot invest in their own in-house research, they depend on other farmers, input suppliers, NGOs, universities and research institutes and private consultants. The fewer the obstacles for accessing new knowledge from external sources, the higher the likelihood that farmers will approach other actors and partner with them in their efforts to innovate and access markets.<br>
                    <br>
                    In a recent study, led by the author, Kenyan flower famers were asked to indicate their 'key sources of knowledge' and 'preference for R&amp;D partners' from among various actors within the national innovation system. The results showed that: (a) farmers prefer NGOs and input suppliers as sources of knowledge and partners in R&amp;D; and (b) universities and research institutes played only a peripheral role as sources of knowledge and were unlikely to be chosen by farmers as 'partners in R&amp;D'. These trends may be explained by the institutional configurations and organizational cultures which shape the habits, behaviour and responsiveness of the actors and determine their propensity to collaborate and innovate.<br>

She considers the identification of the weak points, in terms of sanitisation status, that allow bacterial pathogens to proliferate during composting, the most relevant result of her project. 'Optimised practices of composting as a component of both conservation agriculture and conventional farming is one of the solutions to Africa's soil fertility crisis.' She continued; 'being at the first place in the competition gives me a legitimate sense of fulfilment with respect to the relevance of my research. It has also instilled in me the confidence that I can make a difference in the field of bio-resource management.' Dr Sobratee sees herself in five years' time working in academia in Mauritius, being engaged in both teaching and learning and in research, whereby teaching and learning activities will be driven and informed by her research and development work.<br>

She explains: 'To be effectively achieved, mechanised agriculture must be embedded into existing production strategies, recognise what community resources are available and how these can be mobilised to facilitate the use of the machines.' She considers the award a big milestone in her career, one that makes her believe that although as one person she may not change the world, she can change the world for one person, the smallholder farmer. In the next five years she plans to build a network of researchers working on labour saving technologies, especially for women.<br>

She considers her research important because the adoption and commercialisation of extra-early maize hybrids with these qualities could contribute significantly to food security goals and improved incomes and livelihoods of farmers. She explained that 'the award is a great motivation and encouragement for me. It also inspires me to work harder in order to be one of the winners of the world food prize in the next few years to come. In the next 5 years, I hope to become the head of the maize breeding programme in Nigeria or be working in one of the CGIAR centres developing improved maize varieties that will bring about a maize revolution in West Africa.'<br>

                    Dr Binso won the fourth prize in the <i>Women in Science</i> competition. In her interview with <i>Knowledge for Development</i> she explained that her research had shown that hermetic triple bagging is effective in reducing post-harvest losses of cereal and legume grains without the use of insecticide. 'Hermetic triple bagging technology is a viable alternative because it is effective in reducing grain storage losses and it provides farmers the flexibility to store and sell when prices are high'. She expects that effective extension approaches will lead to quick adoption and commercialisation of the bagging method among smallholder farmers and thus will improve food security through steady supply of quality grain. 'This recognition means a lot to my career and should serve as an encouragement to women scientists whose research contributes to food security. It gives me confidence to commit myself more to research that supports smallholder farmers, especially rural women to improve their livelihood. What I will do in five years? By then I see myself being a specialist in crop storage and an advocate of triple bagging technology.'<br>

                    Dr Rimberia was rewarded the fifth prize in the <i>Women in Science</i> competition. She explained to <i>Knowledge for Development</i> that the most relevant result of her project is the finding that the production of clean and healthy papaya plantlets of known sex can solve the farmers' inability to differentiate among the papaya's 3 sex types at seedling stage. She found that healthy orchards with the correct mix of one male to nine female plants will increase fruit yield greatly compared to the current situation where farmers use guess work. Farmers will be able to grow more fruits and the papaya industry will be able to produce more yoghurt and beauty products. 'This award will increase my visibility in the research community and that of my university. Hopefully, it will help me get a promotion at my university and more funding for research projects. In five years' time, I will be an associate professor with four patents to my name and many scientific publications.'<br>

                    Mrs Kabiri, who won the second prize of the <i>Young Professionals in Science</i> competition, said to <i>Knowledge for Development</i> that mapping <i>Cymbopogon afronardus</i> in Uganda had shown the unprecedented scale of the weed's invasion. 'I observed that an essential oil from <i>C. afronardus</i> controls <i>Cyperus rotundus</i>, another weed severely affecting crop production in Africa. <i>C. afronardus</i> is a cheap and environmentally friendly alternative for selective biological weed and pest control in high value crops. Moreover, its harvesting will improve the quality of rangeland pastures.' She continued: 'The award gave me confidence as a scientist. It made me realise that my research is important for society and that, in its own small way, it contributes to improving food security. I hope that in five years I am a reputable scientist who contributes towards the consolidation of food security and poverty alleviation in sub-Saharan Africa.'<br>

                    According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), 47% of the population could be living under severe water stress by 2050. Modern irrigation practices, including centre pivot irrigation systems, can help improve crop productivity and yields. However, irrigation is also the source of excessive water depletion from aquifers, erosion, and soil degradation. More farmers are using innovative practices to utilize water more efficiently and in lesser quantities to produce more nutritious foods. Using rainwater harvesting, zai pits (a traditional land rehabilitation technology invented by farmers in Burkina Faso), micro-irrigation, bottle irrigation, gravity drip buckets, rotational grazing systems, and other water-saving practices can all help maintain or create sustainable agricultural landscapes. Consumers too can profoundly reduce water waste and consumption, through the food choices they make each day.<br>

                    <i>Women in Science</i>, a new interactive tool produced by the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (UIS), presents the latest available data for countries at all stages of development. By highlighting trends in different regions and countries, this tool provided a unique view on International Women's Day (8 March 2014). The tool allows for exploring and visualising gender gaps in the process that leads to a research career, from the decision to get a doctorate degree to the fields of research women pursue and the sectors in which they work. It presents internationally comparable data produced by the UIS. This means that the indicators can be accurately compared across countries with very different contexts for women in science.<br>
                    It is particularly useful for those interested in a global perspective on the gender gap in research, especially in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The data tool shows just how important it is to encourage girls to pursue mathematics and science at a young age.<br>

                    In <i>Nature</i> Peter Gluckman, New Zealand's chief science adviser, offers his ten principles for building trust, influence, engagement and independence (Issue 507, March 2014). His own experience is of a Westminster-style parliamentary democracy in a small advanced economy. Other countries have different forms of government and different cultural histories of public reason; high-level scientific advice may be provided by individuals, councils or academies, or a combination. Nevertheless, these guidelines are relevant to all those providing advice to senior levels of government.<br>
                    Gluckman's ten principles are: Maintain the trust of many; Protect the independence of advice; Report to the top; Distinguish science for policy from policy for science; Expect to inform policy, not make it; Give science privilege as an input into policy; Recognize the limits of science; Act as a broker not an advocate; Engage the scientific community; and Engage the policy community.<br>

                    Michael Br&uuml;ntrup, of the German Development Institute, writes about the ongoing debate on how to harness policy coherence for development (PCD) in Europe to improve food and nutrition security in poor countries. PCD enables the screening of the EU's external and internal policies for their development implications, to help detect negative impacts and develop mitigation measures. According to Br&uuml;ntrup, these screening exercises often fall short of expectations because of the contradictory internal interests behind EU policies. He points to the more fundamental problem with achieving PCD for African food security: the differential and often opposing impacts of a given EU policy for different target groups and for different circumstances. This makes an objective coherence judgment extremely difficult. Discussing the case of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and agricultural trade regime, he believes PCD in the area of food security is bound to remain patchy, and may be limited to addressing some particularly damaging side-effects of European policies only.<br>

                    OECD's MSTI database provides a set of indicators that reflect the level and structure of the efforts undertaken by OECD member countries and seven non-member economies (Argentina, China, Romania, Russian Federation, Singapore, South Africa, Chinese Taipei) in the field of science and technology from 1981 onwards. These data include final or provisional results as well as forecasts established by government authorities. The indicators cover the resources devoted to research and development, patent families, technology balance of payments and international trade in R&amp;D-intensive industries.<br>
                    The latest OECD estimates confirm the recovery of gross domestic expenditures on R&amp;D (GERD) in 2012. In the OECD area, the level of R&amp;D spending rose by 2.7% in real terms from 2011 to stand above pre-crisis levels for a second straight year. This growth has been driven by a strong recovery in R&amp;D performed by business (+3.5%), which has offset subdued growth of R&amp;D expenditures in higher education institutions (+1.4%) and in the government sector (+0.9). Government R&amp;D budgets remained stable or declined in a majority of countries, reflecting the impact of widespread fiscal consolidation.<br>

                    The Department of Science and Technology of South Africa, in consultation with other relevant stakeholders, has identified three key economic sectors &ndash; agriculture, health and industry &ndash; as being the most in need of, and likely to benefit from key levers to drive the implementation of the South African Bioeconomy Strategy. This new strategy provides a high-level framework to guide biosciences research and innovation investments, as well as decision-making as South Africa adapts to the realities of global transition to a low-carbon economy. Designed to have a technology-push and market-pull approach, the strategy addresses the country's developmental goals and needs, as well as its industrial and agricultural competitiveness.<br>
                    An important development entrenched in the strategy, is the drive to expand the country's shift in focus from developing biotechnology capabilities &ndash; and subsequently the biotechnology sector as a whole &ndash; to developing a bio-economy, where the biotechnology sector joins forces with the ICT sector, environmental agencies, the social sciences and other technologies, especially Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) community of practice, to create holistic solutions and industrial applications for agriculture as well as the health and industrial sectors, in order to create a world-class biotechnological system of innovation.<br>

                    Hala Sabri, a woman scientist and member of the international office at the COMSATS Institute of Information Technology in Pakistan, discusses the post-2015 development agenda and reflects on the role international collaboration could play in developing the 'new' MDGs. According to Sabri, meaningful international partnerships should bring together governments, institutions, aid agencies and industries to rally around specific local development issues, and work on an even footing to introduce change locally by building on existing structures and community initiatives. Multinational partnerships are drivers of change: they permit the transfer of knowledge and with, for example, regional centre of expertise, they facilitate the adaptation of knowledge and technologies to local challenges. Sabri believes international partnerships are especially relevant in sharing successful technological developments across regions, given that the relationship is based on equal footing, i.e. the partnerships' beneficiaries have the liberty to reflect upon and transform successful technologies to their reality.<br>

                    This report by the Royal Society, UK, is a review, based on available data, of the changing patterns of science, and scientific collaboration, in order to provide a basis for understanding such ongoing changes. It aims to identify the opportunities and benefits of international collaboration, to consider how they can best be realised, and to initiate a debate on how international scientific collaboration can be harnessed to tackle global problems more effectively. It explores this changing geography of science and innovation and investigates where and how science is being carried out around the world and the ways in which this picture is changing. The report makes 5 major recommendations: (i) Support for international science should be maintained and strengthened; (ii) Internationally collaborative science should be encouraged, supported and facilitated; (iii) National and international strategies for science are required to address global challenges; (iv) International capacity building is crucial to ensure that the impacts of scientific research are shared globally; (v) Better indicators are required in order to properly evaluate global science.<br>

                    This publication, by the Maastricht University Centre for International Cooperation in Academic Development (MUNDO), The Netherlands, is the result of a two-year process during which university leaders, from eight African universities, developed strategic plans for their institutes to counter the impacts of globalisation and to benefit from the opportunities it presents. For universities in sub-Saharan Africa, where management and administrative capacities are already limited, responding to changes in the global knowledge system is particularly difficult. The strategy papers developed by the leaders of the eight universities take into account their countries' diverse economic, historical, educational, social and political dimensions both to develop and to strengthen the capabilities needed to create and disseminate knowledge, and thus to increase their competitiveness in the global knowledge marketplace.<br>

                    A new publication by PhD students from the Institute of Development Studies (IDS, Sussex, UK) shares previously undocumented insights into the realities and challenges of fieldwork. The <i>IDS Bulletin</i> 'New Perspectives from PhD Field Research', goes beyond typical textbook subjects such as research design, data collection and results analysis and discusses the actual lived experiences and challenges that students face when conducting fieldwork. It comprises seven articles covering locations from Ecuador to Bolivia, Mexico, Kenya, Swaziland, Germany, Nepal, China and India. The nature of the authors' experiences and the topics they reflect on are equally wide ranging, covering, for example: performance and rituals in ethnographic research on peace building; the necessity of engaging with politics in water management, and; the disjuncture between gendered legislation and urban planning. By providing new insights into a variety or research topics, innovations for fieldwork practices, and important reflections on the human experience of PhD research, the authors hope that the Bulletin will benefit both students and the wider community of development practitioners working on the ground.<br>

                    New research of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), Austria shows that the projected transition of livestock systems from pure grazing diets to diets supplemented by higher quality feeds will cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by as much as 23% by 2030. While the reduction of meat in the diets is often seen as a way to reduce GHG emissions, the paper explains that farmers would find it more profitable in coming years to expand livestock production in mixed systems &ndash; where livestock are fed on both grass as well as higher quality feed &ndash; rather than in pure grass-based systems. Such a development would lead to a 23% reduction of emissions from land use change in the next two decades without any explicit climate mitigation policy. This new study projects that the increasing cost of land and continued yield increases in the crop sector will lead to shifts to richer animal diets in the future. Such diets are efficient not only from the perspective of greenhouse gas reduction, but also from farm profit maximisation and food production.<br>

                    A recent study conducted by CIRAD in four different world regions shows that extensive dairy systems in Mali can be more efficient than intensive systems in Reunion Island, and just as efficient as semi-intensive systems in western France. The research team at CIRAD obtained this result using the emergy methodology, which uses one type of unit to evaluate all the resources consumed to generate food or non-food products. This methodology takes into account the complex and multifunctional nature of livestock systems, especially extensive ones. Emergy could be a useful tool enabling decision-makers to develop livestock policies adapted to suit individual contexts, and to thereby meet the growing demand for livestock products.<br>

                    Humans who exhibit symptoms of lactose intolerance could be unable to digest A1, a protein most often found in milk from the high-producing Holstein cows favoured by American and some European industrial dairies. The A1 protein is much less prevalent in milk from Jersey, Guernsey, and most Asian and African cow breeds, where, instead, the A2 protein predominates. The difference between A1 and A2 proteins is subtle. The A2 variety of beta-casein mutated into the A1 version several thousand years ago in some European dairy herds. Two genes code for beta-casein, so modern cows can either be purely A2, A1/A2 hybrids, or purely A1. Milk from goats and humans contains only the A2 beta-casein, yet not everyone likes the flavour of goat milk, which also contains comparatively less vitamin B-12 &ndash; a nutrient essential for creating red blood cells.<br>
                    <i>Editor's note</i>: Another reason to promote local breeds for dairy production? Consumer adoption of dairy products in developing countries could well be determined by the content of A2 protein.<br>

                    Rachel Wynberg and Laura Pereira, of the Department of environmental and geographical science, University of Cape Town, South Africa present preliminary results of their study into the relationship between formal and informal seed innovation systems in South Africa. They argue that a more responsible formal innovation system requires new incentive structures that integrate social benefit, environmental sustainability, agrobiodiversity and food and nutrition security and that is more inclusive in serving the needs of resource-poor farmers. This shift necessitates a transformation in formal seed innovation regimes through the process of 'disruptive innovation' &ndash; innovations that meets the needs of those not served by the dominant institutional and organizational systems. Their work forms part of an ongoing research process to elucidate factors that contribute towards building a more just and sustainable seed innovation system in South Africa, and that makes use of the diverse knowledge bases in the country in order to improve the country's food security and make it more adaptive to potential future stresses.<br>

                    Ly Mouhamed and colleagues of the AGRHYMET Regional Center in Niger, have analysed the evolution of some extreme temperature and precipitation indices over a large area of West Africa. Using daily observations of rainfall and temperature available at the AGRHYMET Regional Center for the 1960-2010 period, they identified a general warming trend throughout the region during that period, namely through a negative trend in the number of cool nights, and more frequent warm days and warm spells. This was the case not only for locations inside the continent, but also for those in coastal areas. Trends in rainfall related indices are not as uniform as the ones in temperatures. Nevertheless, a general tendency of decreased annual total rainfall and maximum number of consecutive wet days characterises the study period. Policy implications of these trends may include investment and promotion of low cost and environmentally friendly energy production systems, the redesign of infrastructure and production systems to account for higher risks of losses due to floods and/or droughts, and the promotion of research for more heat tolerant crop/animal species and cultivars/breeds.<br>

The study found that climate hazards such as droughts, floods and changing rainfall patterns already negatively affect all actors along the coffee value chain, but in different ways and to different extents. Results also showed that coffee farmers and processors generally tend to be more vulnerable to climate hazards than traders, middlemen and exporters, due to their limited diversification, weak organisational capacities and the unfavourable policy environment. As a result of this pilot initiative, for the first time in Uganda, climate risks were integrated into trade-related issues at the ministerial level. A related briefing note has been published '<i>Promoting an Integrated Approach to Climate Adaptation: Lessons from the coffee value chain in Uganda</i>'.<br>

                    Joseph Kofi Saajah of the Ghana Cocoa Board and Bonaventure Kissinger Maalekuu at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science &amp; Technology, have determined how storage of cocoa pods (from a hybrid cocoa variety) affects seed viability, when stored in containers for a specific period. Having analysed the results, the researchers recommend: (i) that farmers continue carting and/or storing cocoa pods in their traditional storage containers; (ii) the hybrid pods meant for propagation ideally should be planted within 0-15 days after harvest (DAH) for maximum viability; (iii) management of cocoa industry should ensure adequate and even distribution of 'gardens' (cocoa stations) to prevent farmers holding harvested pods beyond 15 DAH.<br>

                    Adelaide University Professor Randy Stringer, who has been working with Vanuatu cocoa bean producers under the Pacific Agribusiness Research &amp; Development Initiative (PARDI), sent samples of beans from many communities to Australian chocolate makers. Feedback was received and in the case of Vanuatu, chocolate makers found that the drying and fermentation process after harvest needed to be improved in order to create better beans. Indeed, one of the major challenges faced by the farmers is the need for improved drying methods, to stop the beans being tainted by smoke. Moves are afoot to take on this challenge: drier trials are being set up across the different islands in different conditions, so that farmers can adapt these driers for the ecosystems they have.<br>

                    W. Akinyi Nyonje and colleagues from the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Nairobi, Kenya, conducted a series of experiments to determine the phytochemical and anti-nutrient content of ten amaranth (<i>Amaranthus</i> spp.) varieties at two growth stages, before and after flowering. Amaranth vegetable is widely consumed in Kenya and contributes to the alleviation of food insecurity. It is reported to have bioactive components such as antioxidants that help in protecting the body from long-term degenerative diseases. However, amaranth vegetable has also been shown to contain some anti-nutrients which may bind nutrients and reduce their bioavailability in the body. Results showed significant differences in the phytochemical and anti-nutrient content among the varieties and at the different harvest stages. As the plants matured, the anti-nutrient content increased. The anti-nutrient activity also increased with maturity, from vegetative to post-flowering stage. It is recommended that amaranth leaves be consumed before flowering as they have generally lower anti-nutrients. Among the ten varieties, <i>A. cruentus</i> had the lowest anti-nutrients and the highest phytochemicals concentrations.<br>

                    This research programme conducted by the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, the Universit&auml;t Innsbruck (Austria), and the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ, Germany) investigates the relationship between land use and biodiversity, and between biodiversity and the ecosystem service of biological control. Furthermore, it provides a framework for estimating the value of biological control. As a model pest, APPEAL uses cereal aphid. The results generated are intended to support assessing multiple ecosystem services by providing a clear and adaptable structure for incorporating ecosystem service values into land-use change scenarios. A key research question looks into the advantages and disadvantages of biocontrol services as compared to conventional plant protection.<br>

                    A team of agronomists, entomologists, agro-ecologists, horticulturists and bio-geochemists from the Pennsylvania State University's College of Agricultural Sciences, led by Meagan Schipanski, has been developing a framework for considering a suite of ecosystem services that could be derived from agricultural land. The team quantified the benefits offered by cover crops across more than 10 ecosystem services. Benefits included increased carbon and nitrogen in soils, erosion prevention, more mycorrhizal colonisation &ndash; beneficial soil fungus that helps plants absorb nutrients &ndash; and weed suppression. By integrating a suite of ecosystem services into a unified analytical framework, the researchers highlighted the potential for cover crops to influence a wide array of ecosystem services. They estimated that cover crops increased eight of 11 ecosystem services. In addition, they demonstrated the importance of considering temporal dynamics when assessing management system effects on ecosystem services.<br>
