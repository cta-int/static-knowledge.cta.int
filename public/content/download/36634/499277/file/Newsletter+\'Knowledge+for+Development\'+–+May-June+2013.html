                     The rise in chronic non-communicable nutrition related diseases in the Caribbean accompanied by spiraling health care costs has
                    occurred parallel with changing dietary patterns. For example, the total direct and indirect costs of treating obesity related
                    diseases in five countries in 2003 was estimated to be US$1,000 million.<br>
                    <br>
                    Coming from an era of protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) when food choices favoured energy density (high fat, sugar and protein),
                    coupled with many external influences, Caribbean people have become conditioned to a diet not considered to be healthy. We are
                    now faced with the double burden of under-nutrition (pockets of PEM and iron deficiency anaemia persist) and over-nutrition
                    (cancers, diabetes, hypertension) which threatens to erode all efforts at achieving food and nutrition security.<br>
                    <br>
                    To achieve food and nutrition security requires more insight into the causes of the problem through further research, and more
                    collaborative multi-sectoral efforts. Only by working together will the various sectors (agriculture, health and nutrition,
                    trade, education, science and innovation) achieve the collective objective of improved agricultural and nutrition outcomes.<br>

                     Over the last decade, remote sensing has developed in various ways, strongly increasing its potential as a tool to support
                    integrated agricultural management and sustainable rural development.<br>
                    <br>
                    First of all, geometric or spatial resolution has improved which implies that smaller details on the ground become visible,
                    allowing for a better view of vegetation and its surrounding environment. Second, the improvement of the radiometric or spectral
                    resolution combined with the integral use of information from different spectral channels allows a more accurate analysis and
                    interpretation of the remote sensing data in terms of: type of crop, soil type, state of growth, and presence of disease.
                    Moreover, this aspect facilitates the use of remote sensing data under less favourable atmospheric conditions. Thirdly, the
                    number of operational remote sensing platforms is growing, which allows for almost continuous monitoring at a worldwide scale.
                    Finally, the internet with its ever increasing capabilities has strongly facilitated the availability of remote sensing data and
                    derived data and information products to users, even in remote places.<br>

                    Several countries have developed food and nutrition security policies but food insecurity, hunger and malnutrition remain a
                    challenge. In some cases, national universities have contributed to the elaboration of national and regional policies but their
                    curriculums are not necessarily aligned with them. The Education and Competence Studies Group and the <a href=
                    "http://www.wageningenur.nl/csdfs">Centre for Sustainable Development &amp; Food Security</a> of Wageningen University and

                    and the Pacific and African regional university networks (ANAFE,RUFORUM, TEAM Africa) collaborated in developing the Auditing
                    Instrument for Food Security in Higher Education (AIFSHE) open source tool.<br>
                    The methodology is based on a model for quality assurance developed by the European Foundation for Quality Management, enhanced
                    by the Institute for Dutch Quality Management and refined by a group of Dutch universities for higher education. Twenty different
                    criteria are defined which are clustered in five fields of attention; vision and policy, expertise, educational goals, education
                    content and result assessment. Each criterion, is further described based on agreed characteristics using a five stage process
                    made up of the following components; activity, process, system, chain and society.<br>
                    The draft report of the audit conducted by the University of the West Indies, St Augustine Campus in collaboration with WUR is

                    Food Crops Society and the Caribbean Agro economics Society.<br>
                    CTA has agreed to partner in this conference as reducing postharvest losses is a priority for the African, Caribbean and Pacific
                    Group of countries. The theme of the conference is &lsquo;Postharvest technological initiatives to improve food security and market
                    access&rsquo;. Both oral and poster presentations will highlight information and technological procedures to enable better use of
                    technologies for reducing postharvest losses and improve marketability of fresh and semi-processed horticultural of tropical
                    origin. Postharvest technologies that will enable stakeholders to capitalise on market opportunities, improve competitiveness and
                    adherence to quality and safety standards will be presented. CTA will support the participation of 12 experts from the
                    Caribbean.<br>

                    A Ghanaian scientist designed a computer programme that combines satellite weather data and road conditions along different
                    routes. Mixed into this are traffic information, ideal departure times and the number of (often illegal) stops. It is a recipe
                    that prioritises speed, coolness and shade as well as smooth and level roads while also avoiding traffic jams, long border queues
                    and checkpoints. Reduce spoilage would force the traders to pay the farmers more and sell the tomatoes for less.<br>

                    Yield gap profiles, based on multiple years of satellite data, provide a useful measure of how persistent yield-controlling
                    factors can help overcome spatial and temporal scaling issues that challenge simulation and experiment based analyses of yield
                    gaps.<br>
                    This review discusses the use of remote sensing to measure the magnitude and causes of yield gaps. Two simple yet useful
                    approaches that can be used as complements to each other are presented (those with and without explicit use of ancillary
                    datasets) that measure the persistence of yield differences between fields, which in combination with maps of average yields can
                    be used to direct further study of specific factors.<br>
                    Furthermore, the author David Lobel of Stanford University, states that new commercial systems are delivering high spatial
                    resolution (5m &times; 5m or finer) at costs that are approaching $1 per square km (or $0.01 per ha). In the next decade, it
                    should be increasingly feasible to obtain multiple years of data for regions where field sizes have been too small to distinguish
                    with traditional sensors like Landsat. Satellite data capable of discriminating crop yields on individual fields are more
                    available and affordable than ever.<br>

                    finer than existing similar data layers. A hierarchical vegetation classification was developed by African ecosystem scientists
                    and vegetation geographers, who also provided sample locations of the newly classified vegetation units. The vegetation types and
                    ecosystems were then mapped across the continent using a classification and regression tree inductive model, which predicted the
                    potential distribution of vegetation types from a suite of biophysical environmental attributes including bioclimate region,

                    The document provides an overview of the most common satellite remote sensing (SRS) datasets available to fishery scientists and
                    state-of-the-art data-processing methods, focusing on recently developed techniques for detecting meso-scale features such as
                    eddies, fronts, filaments, and river plumes of major importance in productivity enhancement and associated fish aggregation. A
                    comprehensive review of remotely sensed data applications in fisheries over the past three decades for investigating the
                    relationships between oceanographic conditions and marine resources is provided, emphasizing how synoptic and information-rich
                    SRS data have become instrumental in ecological analyses at community and ecosystem scales. Finally, SRS data, in conjunction
                    with automated in situ data-acquisition systems, can provide the scientific community with a major source of information for
                    ecosystem modelling, a key tool for implementing an ecosystems approach to fisheries management.<br>

                    Produced by leading soil scientists from Europe and Africa, the <i>Soil Atlas of Africa</i> shows the changing nature of soil
                    across the continent. It explains the origin and functions of soil, describes the different soil types that can be found in

                    Landsat represents the world's longest continuously acquired collection of space-based moderate-resolution land remote sensing
                    data. Four decades of imagery provides a unique resource for those who work in agriculture, geology, forestry, regional planning,
                    education, mapping, and global change research. On 30 May 2013, data from the Landsat 8 satellite (launched as the Landsat Data
                    Continuity Mission &ndash; LDCM &ndash; on 11 February 2013) became available over the Internet free of charge. Data collected by
                    the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) onboard the spacecraft since 11 April 2013 are now

                    This briefing paper argues that there is &lsquo;no simple answer to the question of what counts as good evidence&rsquo; if public
                    services are to deliver more for less. The authors focus on evidence that is underpinned by research as opposed to expert opinion
                    or stakeholder views.<br>
                    In debating the issue of evidence quality, they consider research as a &lsquo;way of knowing&rsquo; while acknowledging that
                    there are other ways: empirical, theoretical and experiential. Their overall argument is that the evidence quality depends on the
                    &lsquo;what&rsquo;, &lsquo;why&rsquo; and &lsquo;for whom&rsquo; dimensions as they differentiate between the needs of
                    policymakers and decision-makers. While consensus is possible among sub-groups of stakeholders on what is considered as good
                    evidence, overall consensus is potentially an unreachable goal as power relations can also shape the outcomes. The issues
                    addressed here, for example on the hierarchies of evidence and quality, standards and matrices of evidence, are interesting and
                    relevant for all stakeholders involved in shaping complex and politicised decision-making.<br>

                    This report commissioned by AGree summarises conceptual and methodological challenges of measuring the environmental performance
                    of agriculture. The authors acknowledge that there is no comprehensive, widely accepted index or assessment tool which considers
                    all the related factors concerning the impact of agricultural operations, practices and systems on defined environmental goals
                    for water, wetlands restoration, and native species among others.<br>
                    Different types of performance measures and approaches are reviewed to identify best practices and enhance understanding of the
                    ways in which agricultural and environmental policy might be assessed and strengthened. One main recommendation is that it may be
                    beneficial to engage farmers and ranchers early in the collection and interpretation of data. While it is emphasised that
                    agricultural and environmental policies have distinct purposes, the authors conclude that neither should be pursued in isolation.
                    They conclude that aligning agricultural production with improved environmental outcomes at the landscape scale is a long-term
                    goal achieved through collaboration among various agencies and levels of government, producers, researchers, private companies

                    The Leverhulme Centre for Integrative Research on Agriculture and Health (LCIRAH) was established to build a new inter-sectoral
                    and interdisciplinary platform for integrating research in agriculture and health, with a focus on international development
                    goals. The aim is to better address complex global issues surrounding the need to feed nine billion people healthily by 2050. Its
                    research focuses on how to improve nutrition outcomes through agricultural interventions, such as the introduction of nutritious
                    crop varieties, educational programmes or government policies that make healthy foods more affordable. The June 2013 policy
                    briefs reveal that: 1. Existing agricultural research methods fail to measure nutritional outcomes; 2. Agricultural interventions
                    place different demands on women&rsquo;s resources and time: how they can have a positive nutritional effect without additional
                    burdens.<br>

                    Four new potato clones which are characterised by their high antioxidant content, their good production both in size and number
                    of tubers, as well as by their resistance to the usual diseases of this crop were obtained by natural methods through crossing
                    varieties from South America with commercial varieties used in Europe. Researcher Raquel L&oacute;pez highlights the importance
                    of taking into account the clones achieved: &lsquo;It is beneficial for European producers to have varieties of purple flesh
                    potato that are adapted to the climatological conditions of this continent. Moreover, these varieties incorporate natural

                    Does rapid agricultural growth require a system of innovation? Evidence from Ghana and Burkina Faso

                    The &lsquo;systems of innovation&rsquo; hypothesis is tested to determine if a dynamic and growth oriented agricultural sector is
                    not possible without a functional system of innovation (SI). The researchers moved away from the national system of innovation to
                    highlight the ways that the SI manifests itself using a selection of crops in Ghana and Burkina Faso (plantain, maize, millet,
                    yam, sorghum) that have shown significant growth in production over the last two decades.<br>
                    Using two indicators (a common understanding on objectives and priorities, and a high level of interactivity), the authors find
                    (i) little evidence of common understanding of the objectives or priorities of the SI and (ii) low levels of interactivity. They
                    noted that where there is interaction, it is mainly passive/informal. They concluded that there is weak evidence of the existence
                    of anything that might be considered a high functioning SI. Increases in yield could have been attributed to increased acreage
                    more than to increases in productivity and not to the SI. They are of the view that the most satisfactory explanation linking
                    growth and a functioning SI may only become evident when farmers have exhausted the possibilities of easy wins. From a policy
                    perspective, they suggest that it may be more opportunistic to target investment in agricultural research and other activities
                    that support innovation.<br>

                    There is a great need for research aimed at understanding drought tolerance. Screening for drought tolerant varieties and
                    breeding crops with improved water use efficiency is a crucial step in the right direction. Bananas and plantains are a major
                    staple food (especially in Africa and the Pacific &ndash; editor&rsquo;s note) and export product (in the Caribbean &ndash;
                    editor&rsquo;s note) with a worldwide production of over 135 million tonnes per year. Water however is the most limiting abiotic
                    factor in banana production. Five varieties representing different genomic constitutions in banana (AAAh, AAA, AAB, AABp, and
                    ABB) were selected and subjected to a mild osmotic stress. The ABB variety showed the smallest stress induced growth

                    teaching, research, and rural extension services, the article identifies some of the powerful practical, theoretical, and
                    politico-ideological obstacles preventing the rupture with the paradigm of modernisation on the part of state institutions. More
                    recently, Brazil&rsquo;s National Policy for Organic Production and Agroecology is reaching its final stage. In April 2013, a
                    national committee consisting of 14 representatives from government and civil society met to discuss the last details of the
                    policy. Promising measures include higher levels of government procurement of food from family farms, strengthening of native
                    seed systems, and support for education on agro-ecology.<br>

                    A <i>Nature</i> special issue on GM crops explores the evidence behind some of the most controversial claims about the
                    technology, the impact of the negative attitudes towards this research field, recent advancements such as membrane transporters,
                    and the engineering behind the second generation of GM crops. In this special issue, editors argue that GM research needs to
                    happen outside of the industry (in the non-profit sector) so that developments are driven by objectives other than profit. Key
                    messages point to the profit-driven GM crop development for industrial agriculture that may benefit only national revenues at the
                    expense of smallholders and better livehoods for rural populations. GM crops for the poor to help them combat malnutrition,
                    secure higher yields and save on expensive input is one among several other viable options that can improve the agri-food systems
                    in developing countries.<br>

                    Recent developments in understanding the biology of plant transporters are leading to improved varieties less susceptible to
                    adverse environments and for improving human health. Membrane transporters are a class of specialised proteins that plants use to
                    take up nutrients from the soil, resist toxic metals and pests, increase salt and drought tolerance, control water loss and store
                    sugar. By improving current staple crops by modifying how transporters work in the plants, the biologists behind the discoveries
                    believe crops could be made more efficient in using water, acquiring soil nutrients, etc., and taht growing them would directly
                    reduce the environmental impacts of agriculture. By disseminating these findings widely, the researchers hope to educate policy
                    makers and speed the eventual application of their discoveries to global agriculture. Challenges remain, but this is a promising
                    research avenue. Are such improved food plants considered GMOs? Are they part of the next generation of transgenic crops that may
                    well benefit food insecure regions of the world?<br>

                    The Rainforest Alliance has developed a new set of diagnostic and evaluation tools that help identify the regions, communities
                    and farmers best suited for sustainable cocoa initiatives, as well as the most effective training and technical assistance
                    investments for each setting. With new cocoa varieties, optimal pruning and grafting, and organic fertilisers, farmers can

                    existing forests. Partial shade cover &ndash; studies suggest about 40% may represent a &lsquo;sweet spot&rsquo; &ndash; helps
