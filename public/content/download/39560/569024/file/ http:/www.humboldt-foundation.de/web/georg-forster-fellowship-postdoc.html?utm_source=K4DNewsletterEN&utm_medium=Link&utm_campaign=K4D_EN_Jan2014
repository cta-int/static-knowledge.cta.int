                    Utilising indigenous breeds: Improving the reproductive potential of smallholder dairy herds

                    <img title="Nguni Cattle &ndash; Nguni cow herd (Makatini ecotype). By Justinjerez. Available on https://commons.wikimedia.org." style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px; width: 230px; float: left;" alt="By Justinjerez. Available on https://commons.wikimedia.org" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Nguni_cattle.jpg/640px-Nguni_cattle.jpg"> There is need to improve the reproductive potential of dairy cattle owned by small-holder farmers as well as enhance earning potential. According to Paterson, the challenge for improving small-holder dairy production under communal systems is clear; introduce dairy genetics and supply the quantity and quality of feed to improve reproductive and yield potential.<br>
                    <br>
                    The norm for smallholder livestock herders in Africa is that the stocking density on the grassland reaches a level 300% higher than that of commercial farmers. At this high stocking rate, a balance is reached at which the number of calves born equals the mortality rate plus an off-take of 7%. The conception rate is about 30% and only 1-2% is marketed for cash. In contrast, the annual conception rate for commercial farmers is 90% and the off-take is 30% or higher, all of which is marketed. Using artificial insemination (AI) under a communal and free grazing system is expensive. In Ethiopia, a large trial is in progress using synchronisation of oestrus to bring many of the smallholder cows together to be inseminated by a team led by a veterinarian, making it economically feasible to inseminate 200 cows on one day.<br>
                    <br>
                    The choice of breeds is also critical. The indigenous cattle, e.g. the East African Zebu, are not milking breeds (such as Holstein and Jersey). They are small, weigh on average 300 kg at maturity and produce 6 litres of milk per day; 4 litres for the calf, and the rest for home consumption or sale. This small cow with low milk production and maintenance requirements, is a result of natural selection, which ensures its survival, especially under adverse conditions. The Holstein produces more milk but requires a maize based diet while, the Jersey produces less milk and on grassland. Patterson believes that the Jersey is the ideal breed to crossbreed with indigenous cattle in Africa as the pure bred dairy cattle are unlikely to survive under communal systems.<br>
                    <br>
                    Given the high demand for milk, meeting this demand will require the use of locally adapted dairy cattle breeds and a well thought-out feeding strategy. Also necessary is a dedicated scientific community, effective extension support systems, an enabling policy environment and smallholder farmers who have the required entrepreneurial spirit.<br>

                    Improving livestock water productivity: Lessons from the Nile River Basin

The results are drawn primarily from the CGIAR Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture and Challenge Program on Water and Food.<br>
                    <br>
                    LWP takes an interdisciplinary agro-ecosystems approach to achieve more effective, sustainable and productive use of agricultural water for animal production. It calls for better feed sourcing and management, adoption of best-bet animal production technology, and improved water conservation. LWP is a scale-dependent concept: the elements of the hydrological cycle are studied within a specific spatio-temporal window. It represents the ratio of the total value of goods and services derived from domestic animals to the amount of water depleted as a cost of livestock-keeping.<br>
                    <br>
                    According to Peden, there are basic LWP-enhancing strategies. These include, feed sourcing and management strategies that require the use of feeds with a low water cost of production such as using crop residues which need no additional water. Another is the use of water-conserving strategies which shift evaporation to transpiration, for example by reducing overgazing and improving pasture management. Strategically allocating spatial and temporal distributions of livestock, drinking water and feed resources which&nbsp;also allow for sustainability in animal production, should also be considered.<br>
                    <br>
                    Achieving LWP requires a better understanding of the local situation, and access to and an appropriate mix of technology, training and education, community participation, investment, marketing opportunities and coherent governance.<br>

                    Using less water in crop production systems: Targeting irrigation efficiency gains using a multi-pronged approach

                    <img title="Rice field irrigation in India. By Sebastianjude. Available on https://commons.wikimedia.org." style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px; width: 230px; float: left;" alt="By Sebastianjude. Available on https://commons.wikimedia.org" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Wasser_Reisfeld_Indien.jpg/640px-Wasser_Reisfeld_Indien.jpg"> Irrigation is responsible for about 70-80% of freshwater depletion in most developing countries. According to Lankford's article, worldwide, agriculture evapotranspires approximately 20-25 km<sup>3</sup> of water per day and the 270-300 million hectare irrigated component of this evaporates about 6-9 km<sup>3</sup> of water per day. Rain fed cropping consumes soil water and the range of measures available to manage soil water depletion is limited compared to that for irrigated cropping. As such, agricultural productivity can be boosted by using water more efficiently.<br>
                    <br>
                    Irrigation is believed to 'waste' significant amounts of water; worldwide, irrigation is about 40% efficient. It appears that effective efficiency can be increased by 10-20% (and more) by adopting new technologies or adapting existing practices from water-short farmers. A multi-pronged systems approach is recommended for delivering substantial and verifiable reductions in water consumption over large areas of irrigated lands.<br>
                    <br>
                    Lankford explains that improving irrigation performance involves simultaneous consideration of technological, social and economic points of view. The aim is to achieve this at a reasonable cost using technologies and ideas appropriate for, or already practiced by, irrigators with support from external engineers. Key dimensions of a broader approach include; (a) understanding the need for diverse solutions and assessing diversity and spectrum of irrigation types; (b) mixing and merging local and expert knowledge; (c) capping withdrawals and agreeing the purpose and destination that 'saved' water volumes are reserved for; and (d) comprehensively measuring water use efficiency and monitoring water flows.<br>

                    This CTA publication reflects the state of the art and contemporary thinking and approaches for transforming advisory and extension services and making them more responsive, efficient and effective. It is a major output of the International Conference on 'Innovations in Extension and Advisory Services: Linking Knowledge to Policy and Action for Food and Livelihoods' held in Nairobi in November 2011 which brought together about 500 national, regional and international experts, key stakeholders and organisations.<br>
                    <br>
                    The objective was to take stock of current policies, thinking and practice, successes and failures of ongoing and past reforms in extension and advisory services and build a coalition to address needs of smallholder farmers, in particular marginalised communities, women and youth in a sustainable and cost-effective manner.<br>
                    <br>
                    The published papers were developed from the short-listed abstracts that were selected in response to the call for papers and case-studies and presented during the Conference in 2011. They are presented in keeping with the four thematic areas that were covered: policy, capacity development, tools and approaches and learning networks. These are unique papers that provide insights into the research and practices that are being conducted in the area of extension and advisory services around the world. They also reflect the gaps where more work is needed, especially in the area of policy and impact assessment.<br>
                    <br>
                    The proceedings are a valuable resource for informing policy and practice on extension and advisory services and serves as one of the legacies of the international collaboration that led to this successful conference.

                    The CTA/CARDI report and executive summaries are the outputs of the two day workshop on Coconut industry development in the Caribbean which was held in Georgetown, Guyana, on 7&ndash;8 October 2013 during the 12th Caribbean Week of Agriculture (CWA). The objectives were: (i) to review in-depth the results of the Intra-ACP needs assessment study on the coconut industry in the Caribbean; (ii) to agree on priority interventions and a Road Map for developing the Caribbean coconut industry within a three to five year period at national and regional level, and (iii) to seek endorsement from the Caribbean Ministers attending the CWA on the indicative Road Map.<br>
                    <br>
                    Day 1 of the workshop was dedicated to presentations by the lead consultants of needs assessment study, specialist technical experts and representatives of small and medium to large-scale commercial enterprises. The key issues and gaps identified were:<br>
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Limited high quality planting material, narrow genetic pool, and high economic losses due to pests.
                    </li>
                    <li>Limited market intelligence regarding local, regional and international markets &ndash; for both mainstream and niche products.
                    </li>
                    <li>Limited scientific capacity for addressing issues across the value chain e.g. characterising indigenous genetic resources, improving production and productivity, managing pest and disease, processing, and research and development for new and high value niche products.
                    </li>
                    <li>Limitations in finance and business development especially for small-scale and artisanal industries.
                    </li>
                  </ul>The priority areas of interventions to support future industry development were identified as follows:<br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Certified Quality Planting Material and Pest Management
                    </li>
                    <li>Enhancing Scientific Capacity
                    </li>
                    <li>Market Intelligence
                    </li>
                    <li>Finance and Business Development
                    </li>
                  </ul>On Day 2, the priority areas of intervention were discussed and used as the basis for the development of a draft Coconut Industry Road Map for actions to be taken at national and regional levels within a three tiered time horizon: 12 months or less; 12 months to 3 years; 3 to 5 years during the working group sessions. The recommendations were presented to Caribbean Ministers of Agriculture, their senior representatives, and delegates from national, regional and international organisations and civil society during the meetings of the Alliance and Council for Trade and Economic Development.<br>

                    The Future Earth&nbsp;Transition Team, representing a wide range of disciplines and countries, and the main partners of the Science and Technology Alliance for Global Sustainability, released the Future Earth Initial Design Report early December 2013, at the International Council for Science (ICSU). The report sets out the initial design of <a href="http://www.futureearth.info/?utm_source=K4DNewsletterEN&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_campaign=K4D_EN_Jan2014">Future Earth</a>, a 10-year international research programme launched in June 2012, at the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), comprising a research framework and governance structure; preliminary reflections on communication and engagement, capacity-building and education strategies; and implementation guidelines. The research agenda is structured around three central themes: dynamic planet, global development, and transformations towards sustainability. The report details the key research questions that will be addressed in each area. In the agricultural sub-sector, regarding the issue of climate change for example, important gaps in geographic and temporal observations, understanding of system processes, and confidence in observations and projections must be tackled by better and more coordinated research.<br>

                    The European Commission has published a report on '<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/genetic-resources/pdf/com-2013-838_en.pdf">Agricultural Genetic Resources from conservation to sustainable use</a>' outlining until 2020 the EC's priority areas of action in the conservation and use of its agricultural biodiversity. The sustainable use of genetic resources would involve breeding activities that focus at farm level on underutilised species, traditional and local breeds and crops and enabling farmers to recover traditional knowledge with the necessary skills and know-how. Research should continue to further harness scientific and technological developments to advance in genomic and phenotypic characterisation, preferably oriented to detecting and evaluating relevant traits associated with, such parameters as as productivity, robustness, resource utilisation and product quality. The emphasis is put on an integrated and holistic approach, and the crucial role of active networking, and the harmonisation of the diverse data infrastructures.<br>

                    Monkombu Swaminathan, the veteran Indian crop scientist and World Food Prize laureate, wants the UN to devote a year to the world's 'orphan crops' working with agricultural research organisations. Orphan crops are neglected and underutilised plant species (NUS) that can play an important role in contributing to food security either directly by being grown on the farm and commercialised or through their genetic resources, potentially useful in developing improved varieties of conventional crops. Swaminathan argues for an international concerted effort to develop research frameworks and programmes that would explore and exploit the potential of orphan crops in agriculture. Orphan crops are often proven to be adapted to a wide variety of weather patterns, soil conditions and/or pests and pathogen outbreaks. The esteemed scientist also presses the fact that many of the world's grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables have relatives in the plant kingdom that naturally possess many of the micronutrients lacking in today's diets. In his opinion, society doesn't always need to genetically engineer nutritious crops when natural 'bio-fortified' plants already exist: his point being that orphan crops offer a viable option for food and nutrition security, as much as GM crops can.<br>

                    Led by the Sackler Institute for Nutrition Science at the New York Academy of Sciences, more than 50 nutrition experts from six continents, along with leading NGOs/IGOs, universities, and the World Health Organisation, collaborated for two years to produce the report 'A Global Research Agenda for Nutrition Science'. In order to develop innovative interventions to the challenges of nutrition science, the agenda has identified research gaps in three focus areas: 1) Environmental and Societal Trends Affecting Food and Nutrition Among Vulnerable Groups, 2) Unresolved Issues of Nutrition in the Lifecycle, and 3) Delivery of Intervention and Operational Gaps.<br>

Frei shows that many projects have tried to study nutrients that are naturally available in the human diet the same way they would study a powerful prescription drug, which he thinks is an inadequate research methodology that produces flawed findings. Needed are new methodologies that accurately measure baseline nutrient levels, provide supplements or dietary changes only to subjects who clearly are inadequate or deficient, and then study the resulting changes in their health. Tests must be done with blood plasma or other measurements to verify that the intervention improved the subjects' micronutrient status along with biomarkers of health.<br>

                    Currently scientists do not fully understand how shellfish, such as oysters, mussels, scallops and clams produce their shells, or how a change in environment will affect their populations. To address this, the European Union is funding an ambitious science programme called CACHE (Calcium in a Changing Environment). The programme, implemented by an international team of scientists, coordinated from the British Antarctic Survey, will put light on the role of shellfish in the marine ecosystem and will focus on their capacity to adapt to changing marine conditions. A central aim of the programme is to help young scientists develop their careers through exposure to both research institutions and the business world.<br>

                    A team from CIRAD suggests that adopting an approach based on analysing the functional traits of service plants in banana-based systems in the West Indies would help farmers choose the most appropriate species and decide at what point in the crop cycle these plants must be used. Service plants offer a range of advantages for agro-systems. They can control weeds, regulate pests and diseases and improve soil structural condition and fertility. The researchers tested a number of plant combinations in Caribbean banana agro-ecosystems. For instance, plants that do not harbour the nematodes that attack banana plants were identified. If planted during fallow periods, they clean the soil and avoid the need for nematicides after replanting of the crop.<br>

WICSCBS has well developed physical facilities to carry out sugar cane breeding to support the industries in the member countries. The staff comprises three Senior Scientists &ndash; the Director, Plant Breeder and Geneticist; and a junior scientist responsible for Germplasm and Breeding. WICSCBS goal is to breed superior varieties of sugar cane to cater to the needs of the various member countries. The Station has produced several superior varieties of sugar cane that drive the sugar industries of the member countries. The station has one of the largest sugar cane germplasm collections in the world (over 3000 unique clones) that are maintained on 16 hectares of land.<br>

                    A vast study by Mario Herrero and colleagues at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), shows that animals in many parts of the developing world require far more food to produce a kilo of protein than animals in wealthy countries. It also shows that pork and poultry are being produced far more efficiently than milk and beef, and greenhouse gas emissions vary widely depending on the animal involved and the quality of its diet. The research is a comprehensive assessment of what cows, sheep, pigs, poultry and other farm animals are eating in different parts of the world; how efficiently they convert that feed into milk, eggs and meat; and the amount of greenhouse gases they produce. The paper offers the most detailed portrait to date of 'livestock ecosystems' in different parts of the world and should provide a new foundation for addressing the sustainable development of livestock.<br>

                    In June 2013, the OECD organised the conference '<a href="http://www.oecd.org/tad/agricultural-policies/livestock-diseases-2013.htm">Livestock disease policies: Building bridges between animal science and economics</a>'. This conference focused on how economics, working together with animal sciences, can contribute to a comprehensive and efficient management of livestock disease risks. The four key themes covered were: 1) how to generate a constructive dialogue to reduce and manage uncertainties; 2) the economic assessment of the impacts of animal diseases and control measures; 3) the impact of policy on economic incentives for animal keepers and the food system; and 4) policy making and communication in an uncertain world.

                    Imposing user fees on the non-human use of antibiotics in the agriculture and aquaculture industries

                    Economics professor Aidan Hollis at the University of Calgary, Canada and co-author Ziana Ahmed published their research on viable ways to avoid the potential health crisis posed by the current overuse of antibiotics in the sector. They show that imposing a user fee on the non-human uses of antibiotics, similar to the way in which logging companies pay stumpage fees and oil companies pay royalties, would deter the low-value use of antibiotics, with higher costs encouraging farmers to improve their animal management methods and to adopt better substitutes for the drugs, such as vaccinations. Hollis also suggests that an international treaty could ideally be imposed. Such a treaty might have a fair chance of attaining international compliance, as governments tend to be motivated by revenue collection.<br>

                    Engineering photosynthesis: a step towards increasing crop productivity

                    Research carried out at Cambridge and Oxford Universities, UK, by Ben Williams, Lain Johnston and colleagues revealed the series of evolutionary events that allowed plants using the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis pathway to evolve from C<sub>3</sub> plants. Because they fix carbon dioxide differently, C<sub>4</sub> plants (they include maize, sorghum, millet and sugar cane) are around 50% more efficient than C<sub>3</sub> plants (such as rice, soybean, wheat, rye, oats, millet, barley, potato...). Despite accounting for just 3% of plant species, C<sub>4</sub> plants contribute 30% to terrestrial productivity. Assessing the presence or absence of 16 traits known to be important for the C<sub>4</sub> pathway in 73 different plants and using Bayesian modelling techniques, the scientists have shown that there is significant flexibility in the evolutionary paths that plants have used to get from C<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. This finding therefore implies that the engineering effort meant to develop more productive and efficient C<sub>4</sub> crops is not constrained to only one route.<br>

                    Genetic discovery points the way to much bigger yields in tomato, other flowering food plants

                    Zach Lippman at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, US, has found a way to dramatically increase tomato yields by tweaking a type of hybrid vigour, a property of plant breeding that has been exploited to boost yield since the early 20th century. He managed to coax the plant into producing more fruit without sacrificing the unique bushy plant shape necessary for commercial harvesting. The type of hybrid vigour involved, carried by the florigen gene, has provided the scientists with means to tweak the length of time that bushy tomato varieties can produce flowers. Longer flowering time substantially raises fruit yield.<br>

                    The potential risks of genetically modified crops must be identified before their commercialisation, as happens with all new technologies. In this context, several studies have reported the transfer of transgenes from transgenic rice to red rice weed. However, gene flow also occurs in the opposite direction, resulting in transgenic seeds that have incorporated the traits of wild red rice. In a new study in <i>AoB PLANTS</i>, Xavier Serrat at the Center for Research in Agricultural Genomics (IRTA), Spain, and colleagues found that this reverse flow was higher than direct gene flow, but that transgenic seeds carrying wild genes remained in the spike of the plant and were thus mostly removed at harvesting. Nevertheless, this phenomenon must be considered in fields used for elite seed production and in developing countries where there is a risk of increasing GM red rice weed infestation.<br>

                    Laura Silva Rosales and her team at the Laboratory of Virus-Plant Interactions at the Center of Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute (Cinvestav), Mexico, designed a method capable of identifying the virus of the ringed spot (PRSV) and the mosaic virus (PapMV), two pathogens which leave ring marks in the skin of the papaya fruit and cause softening of the fruit. The system is comprised of detection cartridges (plastic tubes filled with reactive) that are deposited in a sample of a leaf. The team is already working on a field device that would give test results in just an hour.

Soil organic carbon is an essential indicator of good soil quality. It improves the physical properties of soil, notably by increasing its nutrient retention and groundwater protection capacities. To provide consistent carbon stock estimation at the European scale, the model computed almost 164 000 combinations of soil, climate, and land use data, resulting in new soil organic carbon datasets at the pan-European level. The platform provides a comprehensive modelling platform with comparable and harmonised European geographical and numerical datasets. It should prove to be a very useful tool to orient future policy decisions related to soil.<br>

                    In this opinion article, Jaime A. Teixeira da Silva, of the Kagawa University in Japan, argues that the discussion among scientists about the quality of a published paper should be a constant, dynamic process, even beyond the act of publication. According to the author, although there has been an increase in the level of verification by publishers in the first step, the traditional scientific publishing process is still far from being a fail-safe system, seeing how it fails to reveal duplicate submissions. He suggests plant scientists as a community of researchers, reviewers and publishers, must urgently address errors and ethical loopholes to ensure strong and respected publication ecosystem.<br>

                    Deadline: 15 February 2014 -- <b>NOW EXTENDED TO 09 MARCH 2014</b>.<br>
                    <br>
                    CTA is calling for proposals on innovations in use or have potential in smallholder agricultural production systems in ACP countries and which if known and widely promoted can benefit other farming communities. An international jury, comprising a multi-disciplinary team of experts drawn from agricultural research, academia, extension and farmers' organisations will select from among the applicants a shortlist (40&ndash;50) which will then be voted on by farmers. The final top 20 will be selected by an international panel of experts. Successful applicants (CTA top 20) will be given a grant of 5,000 Euros to elaborate their 'innovation' as a guidebook (for which they will receive support from the jury members); and invited to a cross-learning workshop where they will also work with an editor and an artist to finalise the guidebook which explains the innovation and the design of a brochure and a poster which can be disseminated to the public at large (for use, inter alia, by extension agents).<br>
