                    <br>
                    <img title="" style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px; width: 180px; float: left;" alt="Source: Web" src=

                     In his article, Oluwatoyin Kolawole highlights key issues on the peculiarities of Africa&rsquo;s soils and how they affect
                    agricultural production. He argues that because of the very high diversity and spatial heterogeneity in soil type and quality
                    across sub-Saharan Africa, a one-size-fits-all solution is inappropriate to address Africa&rsquo;s divergent soil problems.
                    Kolawole uses a number of research initiatives on integrated soil fertility management to show that Western science and
                    local/indigenous knowledge are not mutually exclusive in driving sustainable management practices and improving yields on small
                    farms.<br>
                    <br>
                    According to Kolawole, traditional ways of managing soil fertility have stood the test of time in many agro-ecological landscapes
                    in Africa. Now, with an agricultural sector being further challenged to respond to climate change and growing concerns about
                    future food insecurity, farmers, scientists and extension personnel must work together to improve, where and when necessary, the
                    traditional farming practices to ensure they are resilient to new environmental stresses and remain productive.<br>
                    <br>
                    Kolawole concludes that data on the extent to which farmers&rsquo; knowledge is incorporated in developing strategies for
                    achieving sustainable intensification, and the impact of joint learning and experimentation which integrates both scientific and
                    indigenous knowledge for improving soil fertility and agricultural productivity, are lacking and much needed.<br>

                    Amir Kassam in his lead article argues that the no-till farming system involving soil cover and crop diversification, known as
                    Conservation Agriculture (CA), is fundamentally changing farming practices and management of the land resource base, the
                    landscape and the environment. As a proponent of this approach, Kassam notes that CA enhances ecosystem services and resilience,
                    and offers additional economic and environmental benefits that are difficult or impossible to mobilise with conventional tillage
                    agriculture.<br>
                    <br>
                    In his view, CA fits within the sustainable intensification paradigm which when defined in its broadest sense, encompasses
                    production and ecological dimensions, the biological products produced and utilised by consumers and with minimum food waste, as
                    well as the human and economic dimensions of socio-cultural aspirations, organisations and social equity and economic growth.
                    According to Kassam, CA is not intensification in the classical sense of greater use of inputs but rather the intensification of
                    knowledge, skills and management practices and the complementary judicious use of other inputs. He sees the new challenge for
                    science and policy in the 21st Century as being able to produce more from less and with minimum damage and to rehabilitate
                    degraded and or abandoned lands while conserving and optimising the use of the remaining water and biodiversity resources.<br>
                    <br>
                    CA is now being practiced on 125 million hectares (about 9% of cropland) across all continents, and approximately 50% lies in the
                    developing countries, including in African countries, namely Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
                    Kassam believes that CA can contribute to the goal of sustainable intensification, but more research and extension effort is
                    needed to inform policy formulation and development strategies.<br>

                    The role of universities and other tertiary education institutions in socio-economic development is being reconceptualised. They
                    are increasingly being called upon to move beyond training and the pursuit of knowledge and become more strategic assets with
                    strong forward and backward linkages to the productive sectors to expand their reach and increase their impact at community and
                    national level. For pragmatic reasons, CTA and Wageningen UR in collaboration with ACP universities, partner networks and
                    organizations have chosen food and nutrition security as the initial content domain to determine the extent of engagement of ACP
                    tertiary education institutes in ARD policy processes. This is one of the most pressing issues nationally, regionally and
                    internationally and universities are currently looking for ways to (re)orient their education and training, research and
                    community outreach programmes to remain relevant.<br>
                    <br>
                    So far the following activities have been undertaken by the participating universities:<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Inception workshop at CTA (18-21 September 2012)<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Quick-scan &ndash; at macro level: what are current provisions, policy-frameworks and issues affecting
                    food security in the country of the pilot universities?<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; Audit/Evaluation &ndash; at meso level an institutional analysis, using the Auditing Instrument for Food
                    Security in Higher Education (AIFSHE) and Mapping - what actors, roles, capacities and responsibilities are needed for a
                    re-orientation towards ARD policy processes?<br>
                    <br>
                    From 25-27 September, CTA in collaboration with Wageningen UR held the synthesis workshop for the 20 representatives of the 10
                    universities who participated in the case study pilots. The objectives were:<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; To present the results of the case studies; to further refine the AIFSHE tool and approaches used; to
                    determine the strategies to be piloted/implemented for improving teaching, research and outreach on food and nutrition security
                    in the partner universities and to develop plans for scaling out to other universities.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull; To reflect on whether the university representatives see themselves as having improved their capacity to
                    become centres of excellence on food and nutrition security in the future.<br>

                    Europe and the United States in August 2013. The purpose was to review the results of six CTA commissioned case studies as well
                    as case studies commissioned by the &lsquo;Africa Extension Reform Group&rsquo; (AERG), entitled &lsquo;Transforming Agricultural
                    Extension in Africa: A Continent-Wide Study of Agricultural Extension Workers at the Grassroots&rsquo;, to derive lessons for
                    policy and practice. This CTA policy learning workshop served as a platform for knowledge exchange on extension and advisory
                    services and charting new areas for further exploration. The presentations and key messages from the workshop are provided. Case
                    study templates for commissioning new studies were reviewed and updated. The synthesis report and policy brief will soon be

                    This publication provides a broad framework for understanding and interpreting the soil resources of Fiji by bringing together
                    into one document all the relevant available soil data. It describes these data in a user-friendly format. A useful component of
                    the manual is the matching of land qualities with crop requirements, leading to a determination of suitability classes for 78
                    crops. In separate formats, single-factor maps for each crop have been generated, and enterprise gross margins have been prepared
                    in Excel spreadsheets.<br>

                    This report from the &lsquo;Evidence for Policy Series&rsquo; by the National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) North-South
                    (Switzerland) details how soil spectroscopy, the study of the spectral fingerprint of dry soil samples, provides a novel and
                    affordable way to assess and monitor the quality of agricultural soils and ultimately support policy making. Spectroscopy can
                    provide the required baseline data on soils that are needed for developing land-management policies. This novel technology can
                    quantify the carbon in the soil, along with many other soil properties. Compared to conventional analytical methods, the
                    technology is non-destructive, inexpensive, and fast. It is an ideal tool for large-scale monitoring and surveillance of soil
                    fertility. The technology is versatile and can be applied both in the laboratory and the field, with less costly infrastructure.
                    In conjunction with remote sensing imagery and geographic position systems, soil spectroscopy can be used for area-wide
                    monitoring of surface soils.<br>

                    Remy Bargout and Manish Raizada at the Department of Plant Agriculture, University of Guelph, Canada review the intrinsic factors
                    that contribute to soil infertility in modern Haiti, as well as the indigenous pre-Columbian soil interventions and modern soil
                    interventions, including farmer-derived interventions and interventions by the Haitian government and Haitian non-governmental
                    organisations (NGOs), bilateral and multilateral agencies, foreign NGOs, and the foreign private sector. This review shows how
                    agricultural soil degradation in modern Haiti is exacerbated by topology, soil type, and rainfall distribution, along with
                    non-sustainable farming practices and poverty. Recommendations aim to address the most important soil intervention gaps in Haiti
                    that include inadequate farmer training (extension) in soil management, and lack of technical support for legume and cover crops
                    and for livestock pastures.<br>

                    Research by scientists at The University of Manchester and Lancaster shows maintaining healthy soil biodiversity can play an
                    important role in optimising land management programmes in the face of climate change. The study shows that there is a strong
                    link between soil organisms and the overall functioning of ecosystems. This is the first time researchers have looked at the
                    entire community of organisms in the soil and the associated dynamics in liberating nitrogen for plant growth and locking up
                    carbon. The findings will help in predicting how land use and climate change will impact on ecosystems and looking at ways to
                    minimise negative changes.<br>

                    Xin Tian, molecular plant scientist at the University of Edinburgh and Peter Doerner, plant cellular physiologist at INRA,
                    France, review the literature on resource foraging, the process by which root system architecture changes over time to acquire
                    resources. The study brings to light the high diversity of root behaviour, including foraging, observed in different species,
                    even in different accessions of the same species, revealing its adaptive nature. The scientists see the need for more fundamental
                    research into root growth mechanisms to inform transgenic approaches and breeding programmes based on existing germplasm.
                    Research into root foraging should not be restricted to crop plants and their interactions, they conclude, saying: 'there is much
                    to learn from wild plants how inter-species competition and how different niches have shaped root foraging strategies in
                    evolution in the quest for more resilient performance for crops experiencing environmental stresses.'<br>

                    This study by Emily S. Cassidy and colleagues of the Institute on the Environment (IonE), University of Minnesota finds that,
                    given the current mix of crop uses, growing food exclusively for direct human consumption could, in principle, increase available
                    food calories by as much as 70%, which could feed an additional 4 billion people. Even small shifts in the reallocation of crops from
                    animal feed and biofuels could significantly increase global food availability. Currently, 36% of the calories produced by the
                    world&acute;s crops are being used for animal feed, and only 12% of those feed calories ultimately contribute to the human diet
                    (as meat and other animal products).<br>

                    Food and Nutrition Security Information (FNSI) is a critical tool for achieving food and nutrition security, yet FNSI efforts to

                    vulnerabilities for the Caribbean Region are: lack of available data on water distribution, urban, agriculture and industrial
                    consumption, future temperature and precipitation trends and sub-regional variability; neglected forward planning and weak
                    foresight capacity; holistic national water policies; maintenance of water and sanitation infrastructure; private sector
                    involvement; appropriate political and regulatory oversight and the autonomy of water managers and service providers. The report

                    research &lsquo;demand&rsquo; from policy/decision-makers. Priorities include the production of better information on integrated
                    solutions and more inclusive cost estimates. Directly related to food systems, research should focus on understanding how food
                    systems, including production, processing, distribution and access will be impacted by and adapt to climate change and extreme
                    events and how these impacts and adaptation strategies interact with other stresses. Emerging topics such as transformative

                    This thesis by Hermann Como&eacute; submitted to ETH Zurich investigates C&ocirc;te d&acute;Ivoire&rsquo;s farmers&rsquo;
                    perception of climate change, their decision behaviour regarding adaptation and the social institutional context whithin which
                    they operate. Findings show farmers have perceived the impacts of climate change on their local environment through evidence such
                    as the disappearance of certain farming practices, the occurrence of new insects, and the disruption of key time reference
                    periods. The main adaptation strategies reported were the adjustment of the agricultural calendar to profit from the favourable
                    periods for the farming season, the adoption of new short-cycle varieties, and the mixed cropping technique. Recommendations for
                    appropriate knowledge transfer are based on a study of the social networks of actors surrounding farmers: one network was highly
                    dependent on one major actor &ndash; the national extension service; the other network relied on a group of diverse actors
                    including NGOs and inter-professional associations.<br>

                    The damage scientists expect climate change to do to crop yields can differ greatly depending on which type of model was used to
                    make those projections, according to research based at Princeton University. Empirical models are built by finding the
                    relationship between observed crop yields and historical environmental conditions, while mechanistic models are built on the
                    physiological understanding of how the plant grows and reproduces in response to a range of conditions. Empirical models are
                    simpler and require fewer inputs and are a staple in studying the possible effects of climate change on ecological systems where
                    the data and knowledge about most species are largely unavailable. Mechanistic models are more common in studying agriculture
                    because there is a much greater wealth of data and knowledge that have accumulated over several thousand years of agricultural
                    development. Each model has different strengths and weaknesses that can be complementary when combined. Using both models lets researchers identify the biases and correct for it. <br>

                    create a community of agricultural researchers who regularly communicate with one another and thereby minimise scientific
                    isolation; 4) share experiences on problems encountered by researchers in publishing their research.<br>
                    Particular attention is paid to the structure of a scientific research paper, planning the writing process, observing style and
                    ethics in scientific writing, correctly citing bibliographic references, and presenting agricultural research results orally.<br>

                    Steve Sonka, the Director of the ADM Institute for the Prevention of Postharvest Loss, a research centre at the University of
                    Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, writes in a post titled &lsquo;Innovation in Measurement: Perspective and Practice&rsquo; in which
                    avenues are discussed to counter the lack of widespread data needed to measure post-harvest losses. Sonka explains that, for
                    decision makers evaluating national food policy, smallholder farmers, or managers throughout the food chain, measurement of
                    benefit/cost ratio hasn&rsquo;t justified widespread collection of relevant data. According to Sonka, innovation in measurement,
                    which could lead to more effective prevention of post-harvest loss, requires capitalising on new technologies, especially
                    information communications technology (ICT) such as mobile phones and social media platforms. He suggests an aggressive effort to
                    adapt technologies not created for application in agriculture, to adopt sophisticated analytical techniques, and to aligning
                    incentives in the design of measurement schemes.<br>

                    This Interim Report by International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) presents the latest update for historical
                    scaling dynamics research including new technologies such as general purpose technologies and small end-use technologies. Scaling
                    refers to the rapid, extensive, and across scale adoption rate of a technology. In particular, it studies the importance of the
                    formative phase in the diffusion of energy technologies and answers the following questions: what are the characteristics of the
                    formative phase in the case of fast and intense adoptions? What is the influence of the formative phase in the overall
                    diffusion?<br>
                    Findings confirm that larger technological transitions require more time for experimentation and maturation in the formative
                    period, especially in the case of complex innovations with high infrastructure needs. In addition, small size technologies with
                    high turnover rates present the fastest diffusion. More research is needed to refine the definition of the moment when the
                    technology completes the formative phase and acquires enough maturity to be massively adopted.<br>

                    Can value chains and innovation platforms boost African agriculture? 11 reasons to be sceptical

                    Toni Darbas (CSIRO, Australia) and Jim Sumberg (IDS, UK) express their scepticism about the recent &lsquo;value chains&rsquo;
                    narrative in agricultural development discourse that sees agriculture as a &lsquo;business&rsquo; that must be
                    &lsquo;professionalised&rsquo;. The authors believe that there are good reasons to be sceptical about their ability to deliver on
                    the high expectations that are being laid at their door. Some of the reasons for scepticism they list are: unknown feedback
                    across administrative scales; unknown evolution of transaction costs; private sector interests vs. public ones; inclusion issues;
                    innovation blueprints insensitive to context; little direct evidence of positive impact of innovation platforms and value chains
                    to poor farmers. They believe there is the constant danger of slipping into uncritical, formulaic and context insensitive
                    responses. A much more critical and realistic approach to the potential contribution and applicability of both value chain
                    approaches and innovation platforms would likely pay large dividends, they conclude.<br>

                    Tareke Berhe, who developed a High Yielding Variety (HYV) of tef and now leads the Tef &amp; Rice Value Chains at the Ethiopian
                    Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA), made several important breakthroughs in his tef research. Berhe notes that tef
                    farmers still use the traditional, less productive planting method of broadcasting (scattering seeds by hand). Another
                    observation led him to understand why the crop on the perimeters of the fields grew stronger and more fruitful: the plants had
                    more room to grow, competing less for sunlight, water and nutrients. Field tests have shown that greater spacing between each
                    plant permits improvement in productivity, leaf size and stalk strength of the crop. Changing practices to adopt row planting
                    would also use less seeds and farmers sowing earlier in the season can plant tef twice a year. Tef production and yield could rise
                    significantly if farmers would adopt crop management practices similar to the ones dictated by the principles of the System of
                    Rice Intensification (SRI).<br>

                    A team of scientists from Australia and China investigated the overall plant health of two barley varieties grown under
                    controlled salt and/or water stress conditions. They found that combined salinity and water-logging treatment (mimicking
                    conditions where salt is brought to the surface by rising water tables) significantly decreased plant biomass and other plant
                    health variables. The experiment also provides a better understanding of what is most affected by combined stress in the barley
                    plant depending on the soil types used. The results presented in this paper on mineral ratios, ionisation, and other variables
                    will give barley breeders insight into how the plant may react and survive in combined stress and help them select truly
                    resistant cultivars.<br>

                    A consortium of researchers from The University of Queensland, Australia, the Queensland Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and
                    Forestry (DAFF Qld) and BGI, a private company, conducted whole-genome sequencing of sorghum. The team obtained the genomic data
                    of 44 sorghum lines to represent all major races of cultivated grain sorghum in addition to its progenitors and the allopatric
                    Asian species. The analysis indicated that sorghum possesses a diverse primary gene pool but with decreased diversity in both
                    landrace and improved groups. They found that modern cultivated sorghum was derived from a limited sample of racial variation,
                    meaning the actual cultivated varieties come from a very limited spectrum of the complete sorghum genome. The discovery will help
                    breeders improve the cultivated varieties with traits &ndash; yet to be identified &ndash; that confer resistance to various

                    This study incorporates extensive farmer interviews and population genetic analysis of barley landraces (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>)
                    to build a holistic picture of farmer-mediated gene flow in an ancient agricultural system in the highlands of Ethiopia.
                    Phenotypic analysis of barley samples made possible links between genetic patterns and traits identified by farmers. The study
                    finds that differential farmer management strategies lead to markedly different patterns of population structure across elevation
                    classes and barley types. The extent to which farmer seed management appears as a stronger determinant of spatial structure than
                    the physical landscape highlights the need for incorporation of social, landscape, and genetic data for the design of
                    conservation strategies in human-influenced landscapes. The research recognises the importance of considering farmers&rsquo;
                    economic and cultural needs in designing appropriate conservation strategies.<br>

                    assessment of crop phenological development, (4) crop acreage estimation and cropland mapping and (5) mapping of disturbances and
                    land use/land cover (LULC) changes. In the end, Atzberger&acute;s recommendations on future developments include: ensure
                    timeliness of information, access and validation of ground truth information, more precise atmospheric correction algorithms,
                    Sensor inter-calibration studies, more detailed description of a product&acute;s purpose and limits.<br>

                    CSIRO, the Australian scientific and industrial research organisation, offers a succinct description of state-of-the-art
                    food-processing technologies used in the treatment of export products. &lsquo;Cool plasma&acute;, for example, is an ionised gas
                    containing reactive particles used to inactivate pests on the surface. Somewhat similar are &lsquo;low energy electron
                    beams&rsquo; which inactivate bacteria, spores, fungi and insects through ionisation of the molecules in the pest.&rsquo;
                    Microwave processing&rsquo; relies on large scale, high-power microwaves to disinfest fresh produce and grains.
                    &lsquo;Ultrasound&rsquo; is generated by vibrating plates to create water vapour cavitation bubbles that explode to kill pests
                    and remove cracks and crevices on the products. Taking advantage of gentler processing methods resulting in more fresh-like
                    quality, the techniques are already in use around the world.<br>

                    Scientists from the &Eacute;cole Polytechnique F&eacute;d&eacute;rale de Lausanne, Switzerland, investigate how geographical and
                    environmental characteristics affect the genetic structure of livestock populations around the world to help correlate genetic
                    variation patterns with geographic variables. They explore the potential of a number of different molecular markers, in source
                    material varying from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to Y chromosomes, for livestock landscape genomics. The main marker systems in
                    livestock studies are Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism&rsquo; (AFPL, combining DNA digestion and polymerase chain reaction
                    PCR amplification), microsatellites (markers in the nuclear DNA), mitochondrial DNA (examination of uniparental clonal
                    inheritance), Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), and Copy Number Variation (CNV). In a similar effort to crop breeders
                    analysing crop wild relatives and underutilised plants for useful gene discovery, livestock researchers have analysed the genomes
                    of local/native breeds to associate unique loci with environmental parameters. This effort can help improve livestock herds
                    gravely affected by rapid and permanent changes in the environment.<br>
