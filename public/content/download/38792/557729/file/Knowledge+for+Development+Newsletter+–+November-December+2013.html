                    Ecological sustainability in times of change &ndash; how to measure success?
                  </h3>
                  <p style="margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; font-size:15px;">

                    <br>
                    <img title="Vegetation zones. CC." style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px; width: 230px; float: left;" alt="Source: Wikimedia Creative Commons" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Vegetationszonen.png/320px-Vegetationszonen.png"> Agricultural production is being impacted by changes in climate, ecology and the environment. At the same time, agricultural intensification, population growth, urbanisation and industrialisation also impact upon the ecology and environment. In this context, achieving ecological sustainability is often seen as a desirable goal. But what is ecological sustainability? The meaning appears to be different when viewed through the lenses of various experts e.g. environmentalists, sociologists or economists. Ecological sustainability requires wise governance, based upon clear objectives, criteria and priorities, and should be supported by a solid basis of updated, complete and reliable data and information on ecosystems, natural resources and related issues such as socio-economy.<br>
                    <br>
                    Three broad criteria have been identified for achieving ecological sustainability:<br>
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>renewable resources should provide a sustainable yield (the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration);
                    </li>
                    <li>for non-renewable resources there should be equivalent development of renewable substitutes;
                    </li>
                    <li>waste generation should not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment.
                    </li>
                  </ul>These criteria should be included in government strategies and policies, and be supported by a platform of visionary leaders drawn from the wider society including private industry and the population as a whole, in order to ensure their sustainability.<br>
                  To measure the success in attaining ecological sustainability, the management and decision-making process requires information which is linked to indicators based on three main categories:<br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>indicators that relate to a <i>process</i>, usually at organisational level;
                    </li>
                    <li>indicators of <i>stress reduction</i>;
                    </li>
                    <li>indicators of the <i>actual state of ecosystems and environment</i>, such as the condition of drinking water and ground water resources, and the state of the biodiversity.
                    </li>
                  </ul>Indicators of the actual state of ecosystems and environment need to be based upon updated, complete and reliable data and information. These can be obtained from a well-defined monitoring process. The main requirement of the decision-making process relates to the future: what changes are to be expected in the (near) future? What could be the impact of a specific decision or measure? This implies the need for forecasts and simulations, based upon models of the ecosystem and the environment.<br>

                    Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis of the CTA ST&amp;I Strategies Programme
                  </h4>
                  <p style="margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; font-size:14px;">
                    In November 2013, CTA undertook a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis of the CTA ST&amp;I Strategies Programme. The analysis used the results of a two-week online questionnaire targeting 250 partners and beneficiaries and of an environmental scan of the ACP/EU and international S&amp;T landscape.<br>
                    <br>
                    The preliminary results of both the survey and the environmental scan were shared and further interrogated during an ACP/EU expert workshop held 13&ndash;15 November 2013 in the Netherlands. The recommendations of the expert workshop were used to finalise the SWOT report and identify future priorities and intervention areas.<br>
                    <br>
                    The responses to the survey and the discussions of the working group indicate remarkable satisfaction with the achievements of the ST&amp;I Strategies Programme and strong support for its continuation. The programme still acts as a critical element of CTA&rsquo;s overall commitment to (i) Building and documenting the evidence base for agricultural policies; (ii) Strengthening the capacity of stakeholders; and to (iii) the dissemination for better policy making and implementation.<br>
                    <br>
                    The SWOT respondents indicated that maintaining CTA&rsquo;s competence and neutrality is essential to the continuing success of the ST&amp;I Strategies Programme. It should protect these strengths and furthermore consolidate its ability to build strong and effective relationships with ACP stakeholders through networking, hosted events, publications and the Centre&rsquo;s website. Among the identified weaknesses is CTA&rsquo;s inability to date to fully demonstrate and get the credit it deserves for its achievements. Clear articulation of the outcomes CTA is aiming for would help the development of impact assessment techniques.<br>
                    <br>
                    To prioritise interventions, The ST&amp;I Strategies Programme must be able to tease out from the myriad of emerging issues and opportunities those in which it has most comparative advantage for making the greatest contributions. As in the past, CTA&rsquo;s comparative advantage lies in detecting these emerging issues and in its ability to generate knowledge and raise awareness. This is what the respondents recognised as having been the prime source of the ST&amp;I Strategies Programme&rsquo;s achievements as exemplified by past activities related to national innovation systems, foresight, etc.<br>
                    <br>
                    In summary this SWOT analysis confirms that CTA and its ST&amp;I Strategies Programme have done very well with the resources available. There is continuing demand for it and the challenges should be tackled head-on.<br>

                    CAASTNet-Plus/EC High level Policy Dialogue Side Event: EU-Africa ST&amp;I Cooperation on Food and Nutrition Security, November 28, Brussels
                  </h4>
                  <p style="margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; font-size:14px;">
                    The objective of the FP7 CAAST-Net Plus project is to encourage better bi-regional ST&amp;I cooperation around the challenges of climate change, food security and health. CTA is a partner in the CAAST-Net Plus project and leads on Work Package WP 1.1. Tasks assigned to this work package aim to contribute to the structuring and strengthening of the cooperation in food and nutrition security (FNS) research and innovation between Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa. More precisely, WP1 is designed to: (i) assess the impact of Africa-Europe collaborative research on joint food security priorities, (ii) contribute to bridging the public-private gap for the dissemination and exploitation of research results, (iii) foster a Europe-Africa multi-actor platform for researchable joint priorities.<br>
                    <br>
                    Preliminary desk research undertaken by CTA included the compilation of a database of EU funded bi-regional and bilateral member states research cooperation FNS projects, the review of policy documents and reports and the classification of 73 projects following FNS priorities; availability, accessibility, utilization, ecology etc. A snapshot of the focus areas of the projects shows, among other findings, a strong preference foe; the development of databases (30%), increasing availability - mainly productivity enhancements in livestock and grains (18%), and aspects that address utilization &ndash; quality and safety (13%) and ecology (12%). However, Africa&rsquo;s food and nutrition security problems are more related to access (economic and physical) which received a low score (4%). Little evidence exists to suggest that mechanisms exist for sharing experiences and knowledge and for joint learning across projects.<br>
                    <br>
                    In light of this examination, CAASTNet Plus is proposing more support towards co-owned and co-funded joint programming. Additionally, a roadmap and a joint Africa-EU ST&amp;I Think Tank on FNS were recommended for consideration. Immediate next steps to be undertaken by CTA as part of its contribution include: a more complete survey of projects and interviews with project leaders, stakeholder meetings to identify joint priorities, and the monitoring of uptake of research outputs.<br>

                    Researchers with InSTePP (International Science &amp; Technology Practice &amp; Policy) at the University of Minnesota have compiled a comprehensive database of rate of return (RR) estimates from the worldwide literature on food and agricultural R&amp;D. They found that the wide dispersion in the reported RR makes it difficult to discern meaningful patterns in the evidence. Nonetheless, RR values based on the internal rate of return (IRR) were high regardless of the type of research, commodity focus, performer, or time period of the research. The authors question whether this IRR evidence should be taken at face value: they show that high IRR values and their implausible implications are the result flawed assumptions used in calculations. They suggest alternatives that utilise more appropriate assumptions and yield more sensible implications.<br>

                    This ASTI report by IFPRI presents econometric data on total public agricultural R&amp;D spending in Asia&ndash;Pacific and related agricultural research indicators over the period ranging from 1996 to 2008. The only ACP country included in the sample is Papua New Guinea, where public agricultural R&amp;D spending decreased by almost half over the study period (so too did the share of AgGDP spent on R&amp;D). Nevertheless, more researchers have been hired by National Agricultural Research Institute (NARI), and in 2010, more women researchers worked there than in 2002 (though the absolute share of women scientists decreased). Almost 30% of PNG&rsquo;s agricultural scientists employed in the public sector are aged 31 or under.<br>

                    A new report, &lsquo;The social, economic and environmental value of agricultural productivity in the European Union&rsquo;, has been published by the Humboldt Forum for Food and Agriculture in Germany. The study assesses data on the economic, social and environmental effects of productive agriculture (which uses modern technologies such as agricultural machinery, new seed varieties, organic and/or mineral fertilisers, and plant protection products and solutions) in the EU. According to the findings, each percentage point increase in agricultural productivity in the EU: feeds more than 10 million humans per year; increases the annual social welfare generated in European agriculture by approximately 500 million; contributes &euro;500 to the annual income of an average EU farmer; reduces net virtual land imports by about 1.2 million hectares; acts to save 220 million tons in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; preserves global biodiversity equivalent to fauna and flora of up to 600,000 hectares of rainforest. Switching to low input agricultural methods, with average 31% lower yields than productive agriculture in the EU, would come at the cost of these benefits, according to the report's authors.<br>

                    This INASP paper exposes the need to ensure that policy makers are able to demand and use research evidence. They argue that while many capacity building programmes improved skills for communicating research information, there is no actual investigation into the actual capacity to access, evaluate and use research evidence. Promoting evidence-informed policy relies not only on supporting the &lsquo;supply&rsquo; of research evidence but also the &lsquo;demand&rsquo; from policy makers. The paper explores a number of methodologies for evaluating capacity to access and use research information. For example, in Uganda, experts were commissioned to review the use of evidence in policy documents produced for the Ugandan parliament. The findings (<a href="http://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/executive%20summary.pdf">available here</a>) show that a low level of ST&amp;I literacy among MPs undermines the widespread willingness to improve the Ugandan government&rsquo;s handling of ST&amp;I.<br>

                    Attempts to explain the astonishing differences in agricultural productivity around the world typically focus on farm size, farmer risk aversion, and credit constraints, with an emphasis on how they might serve to limit technology adoption. This paper takes a different tack: can managerial practices explain this variation in productivity? A randomised evaluation of the introduction of a mobile-phone based agricultural consulting service to cotton farmers in Gujarat, India, reveals the following: farmers offered the service turn less often to other farmers and input sellers for agricultural advice. Management practices change as well: there was an increase in the adoption of more effective pesticides and reduced expenditure on less effective and hazardous pesticides. Also, farmers appear willing to follow advice without understanding why the advice is correct, because lack of education inhibits the acquisition of knowledge.<br>

                    UK&rsquo;s DFID conducted a broad survey of key stakeholders in sustainable African agriculture to assess current and emerging trends in data collection, processing, and dissemination. A key focus of the study was to assess the alignment of stakeholders&rsquo; perceived data needs with areas of decision uncertainty. Only 36% of respondents stated data needs that were consistent with their stated uncertainties and only 15% showed that perceived needs, uncertainties, and data gathering efforts are aligned. Data for soils were the most frequently cited, followed by data for markets, climate, biodiversity and poverty. Recommendations for improving the collection and use of data in African agriculture include building comprehensive, centralised web-enabled GIS databases and developing awareness of the key decisions and what data is needed to support them.<br>

She suggests that universities should set up the appropriate infrastructure and develop capacity to ensure research efforts and ideas are &lsquo;pushed&rsquo; into the external environment. Getting the &lsquo;word out&rsquo; and successfully engaging stakeholders, she explains, is beneficial in a number of ways: learning is mutual, research results are improved and research is legitimised. Grobbelaar believes training for researchers and their support staff is needed on appropriate engagement approaches and participation methods, and on administering and managing a university&rsquo;s knowledge base.<br>

Recent DRUSSA campus visits have raised the question of how university radio stations can be leveraged into a Research Uptake Management strategy. One way radio programmes could help is by facilitating external stakeholder engagement &ndash; by explaining to the audience the research purpose, results and real-life impact and encouraging &lsquo;talk-back&rsquo; programmes. According to Harber, the universities however need to ensure they offer valued recognition to their radio-trained alumni to help secure the replacement of on-campus communicators.<br>

It was concluded that young agri-professionals face a major challenge in combating food insecurity. To be successful, they will have to utilise their skills in an exceptional manner and for that tertiary agricultural education must ensure: (a) effective communication of science in agriculture, (b) integration of social media in agriculture, (c) promotion of agriculture as a career path, and (d) networking capacity to influence national agenda. Also identified was the need to communicate a more positive image of agriculture to young people, promote high school agriculture, and related agriculture literacy programmes.<br>

This study involved the virtual screening of the three dimensional structure of the compounds to calculate their physico-chemical properties. In addition, a series of descriptors have been used to predict the pharmacokinetic profile of these natural products (NPs). The availability of such structures and calculated properties within AfroDb will facilitate the drug discovery process from leads identified from African medicinal plants.

                    The findings of a study led by Matthew Bowker, assistant professor of forest soils and ecosystem ecology at Northern Arizona University, shows that, as drylands of the world become even drier, levels of nutrients in the soil will be affected, and their imbalance could affect agricultural productivity around the globe. The statistical model he helped develop for the study suggests that as the climate becomes more arid, nitrogen will decrease and phosphorus will increase.<br>

                    Irene Murgia of the Department of Biosciences, Universit&agrave; degli Studi di Milano, Italy and colleagues provided the most recent papers identifying advances on plant biofortification for micronutrients and a comprehensive overview of the different approaches that can be pursued for producing micronutrient-rich staple plants. Some of the major points arising from these papers relate to vitamins (Bs, C and D), metal micronutrients (Iron, zinc and manganese) and iodine. The papers presented here demonstrate how knowledge in plant metabolism, physiology, and molecular biology can provide approaches for increasing the nutritional value of plant derived foods. The contributions also draw attention to the need for multidisciplinary efforts to cope with the challenges of food security and micronutrient malnutrition.<br>

                    Esin Mete, President of the International Fertilizer Industry Association (IFA), explains how fertilisers fortified with micronutrients &ndash; adding selenium, zinc or iodine to the nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium usually present &ndash; can augment the nutritional content of a number of staple foods and positively affect the health of a population. Her main point is that micronutrient fortification of nutrient-deficient soils can not only help boost crop yields but also improve the content and bioavailability of these nutrients in plants when consumed by humans. Mete cites results from successful experiments in Finland, India, China and Malawi where nutrient deficiency in humans has been tackled by using nutrient enriched fertilisers to grow staple food.<br>

Results showed that transplanted rice (paddy control) and <i>Sesbania aculeata</i> (a legume) mulch were found to be the best in respect to Fe concentration in grain, straw and yield. However, three foliar sprays of FeSO<sub>4</sub> at maximum tillering (emergence of aerial shoots), pre-flowering and flowering gave the higher Fe concentration in grain and straw of aerobic rice. This article offers recommendations on the best practices for mulching and the appropriate iron concentration in fertiliser solutions.<br>

                    An international team led by the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences (NIAS) in Japan, has discovered the DRO1 gene that makes the roots of rice plants grow downward instead of outward. This allows the plants to reach water held deeper in the soil. Plants with DRO1 can continue to grow and produce grain even under extreme water stress. The researchers also found that the DRO1 gene appears to change only the angle of root growth and slightly increase the length of the root tips, rather than the overall root density, meaning that energy is not diverted away from the production of grain.<br>

                    Louise H. Comas, USDA, Colorado and colleagues in the USA have identified a number of root traits associated with maintaining plant productivity under drought. These include small fine root diameters, long specific root length, and root length density. Small xylem diameters in targeted seminal roots appear to save soil water deep in the soil profile for use during crop maturation and result in improved yields. Capacity for deep root growth and large xylem diameters in deep roots may also improve root acquisition of water when ample water at depth is available. The authors believe a better understanding of root functional traits and how traits are related to plant productivity under different drought conditions is needed.<br>

                    Maruthi Gowda and his team from the Natural Resources Institute of the University of Greenwich have developed a procedure for eliminating virus infections from cassava. They built a 'virus-indexing' procedure for cleaning cassava lines, which involves a combination of protocols for accurate identification and elimination of viruses. The procedure involves growing disease-infected cassava stem cuttings and identifying at a later stage plants free of disease symptoms. Plants free of viruses are then grown in tissue culture media, certified to be virus-free after several disinfection protocols and shipped to African partners for further multiplication and subsequent distribution to farmers.<br>

                    Research by CIRAD and IITA aimed to control fruit flies infestation in West Africa&rsquo;s mango plantations found that weaver ants are a natural and effective biological control method against fruit flies. In-depth studies confirmed the ants&rsquo; impact on the structure and composition of plant-eating pests. These studies also showed that they prey mainly on larvae, as they leave infested fruits, and rarely on adults. However, this is not their only mode of action. The scientists discovered that they have a repellent effect on fruit flies: after ants have been on mangoes, fruit flies turn away from them and lay much fewer eggs. This phenomenon of repulsion, which was confirmed in the laboratory and in the field, is caused by physical (micro-spots) and chemical (pheromones) signals left by ants.<br>

Bayala, ICRAF-WCA, Mali and colleagues in West Africa carried out an experiment in Burkina Faso to characterise crop-tree interactions under a series of tree maintenance regimes. The treatment included root trenching and crown pruning of two tree species <i>Parkia biglobosa</i> and <i>Vitellaria paradoxa</i>, known to improve soil fertility and redistribute water, in a sorghum field. The results show that sorghum yield vary significantly depending on the treatment and the species used. An implication of this is that recommendations for including trees in cropland, or for management of existing trees within cropland, must be context and species specific.<br>

Results show that intercropping rubber with coffee and cocoa is a profitable combination, helping smallholders diversify their sources of income and make better use of their land. Rubber-lemon and rubber-cola nut systems were never profitable however.

                    Catherine Muui at Kenyatta University and colleagues collected the germplasm of sorghum landraces in four major sorghum growing regions of the eastern province of Kenya. Information was collected on farmer preferred traits, seed sources and variety type and recorded for each of the forty four different landraces obtained. Results show that the landraces carry unique traits associated with environmental adaptation, biotic stress resistance, grain yield and quality, food preparation and post-harvest processing. The authors believe this yet untapped diversity could be useful in crop improvement programmes. They fear however that the decline in use of the landraces may erode the genetic base of sorghum and prevent the use of distinctive traits in the future. The study underscores the importance of farmer-led <i>ex situ</i> conservation of plant genetic resources.<br>

                    Peter Cyr, a genebank manager, and his team was asked by the Global Crop Diversity Trust, devoted to protect the world's plant genetic resources, to develop a new seed bank management system &ndash; GRIN-Global &ndash; that could provide for developing countries needing a zero-cost system as well as mature, better-supported gene banks. According to Cyr, &lsquo;sharing information will be much easier as we will all be running the same system and it provides some wonderful capacity building for Third World countries&rsquo;. Nearly every gene bank used a different data cataloguing system, making it difficult for plant breeders to search for potential genetic material. The GRIN-Global system is being introduced at seed storage banks around the world to begin consolidating data management.<br>

                    With the help of GIS and spatial analysis, Zhe Guo and colleagues from HarvestChoice and IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute) designed a methodology to harmonise and geo-reference crop phenology data, resulting in the first generation of Crop Calendar products at the pixel scale (1 km2) for sub-Saharan Africa. Crop Calendars can be developed in one or two ways: through coarser, more traditional methods that rely on household surveys, country census data, and ground verifications; or via modern methods using remotely-sensed, time-series data. Both methods have their advantages and limitations, depending on the nature of the region and the quality of the information needed. A next step in this study is to evaluate Crop Calendar products derived from both ways and design a strategy to geo-reference and harmonise the two data. By combining phenology products derived from remote sensing and geo-referenced tabulation data, the quality of Crop Calendar products could substantially improve and better inform stakeholders from suppliers and growers to marketers and traders.<br>

                    The Institute for Environment and Sustainability recently published a peer-reviewed article illustrating the application of the G2 model, a new model for understanding seasonal soil erosion dynamics. The G2 model allows for the regular mapping of soil loss estimations by land-use type on local and regional scales, and provides alternatives for the estimation of all erosion factors. It is based on moderate data input requirements; public users can download the data layers. G2 was used in to produce seasonal erosion figures crucial for the identification of erosion hotspots and of risky land uses in the Mediterranean island of Crete.<br>

                    Developments in industry, agriculture, waste handling and lifestyle have massively reduced the capacity for phosphorus to be cycled effectively by society and the environment via natural geological processes. The major source of phosphorus used in fertiliser is phosphate rock, which is mined in vast quantities, more than can be replaced by the slow geological cycle. This In-depth Report, written and edited by the Science Communication Unit, University of the West of England (UWE), Bristol, and produced for the European Commission DG Environment examines scientific knowledge on the phosphorus challenge and recent research into the sustainable use of the element.<br>

                    David Filiberto at Cornell University and John Gaunt of Carbon Consulting, Ithaca, USA explain why the need for further clarity on optimising biochar (charcoal) application to various crop yields is necessary if it is to gain widespread acceptance as a soil amendment. Biochar may be added to soils with the intention to improve the soil, displace an amount of conventional fossil fuel based fertilisers, and sequester carbon. However, the economics of biochar use as a soil conditioning amendment are challenging. The authors suggest that further research is needed to determine the optimal biochar application rate. They believe that strategies focused on high value crops that require high levels of fertiliser application may prove more fruitful in sustaining the economic viability of the technique.<br>

                    This review led by Albert O. Amosu of the University of the Western Cape, depicts the South African seaweed aquaculture industry. Seaweeds are one of South Africa&rsquo;s most important aquaculture products, constituting an important fish feed source and biomass for biofuel production. To mitigate for the reliance on wild harvesting, the South African seaweed aquaculture industry has built many on-land integrated culture units (preferred method for the industry). This growth has paralleled the rise of the abalone industry, and has been successful largely because of bilateral technology transfer and innovation between commercial abalone farms and research institutions. The authors believe the successful development provides a template abroad to help other countries further their aquaculture sector.<br>

                    Scientists with the Nature Conservancy organisation have come up with a new way to count fish on complex coral reefs of the island nation of Palau. Instead of counting the number of fish in the water, the idea is to determine the proportion of the population capable of breeding for each fish species. The scientists trained fishermen on how to measure the length of the fish they catch. They also showed them how to cut open the fish&rsquo;s stomach and inspect their gonads to determine the sex and if it&rsquo;s sexually mature or an immature juvenile. This information will tell them if enough fish are breeding to repopulate and sustain the fish populations, and if the fish are growing to their adult size. The data collected over a year clearly show Palau&rsquo;s fish are in decline and risk of collapse. Because the Palau fishermen were involved in the data collection process, they were able to see and understand first-hand what was happening to their fish. Rehabilitation options include setting a minimum size requirement for harvested fish and closing fishing in some areas until the fish can rebound.<br>

                    Through frequent treatment of cattle with acaricides &ndash; pesticides for ticks and mites &ndash; mainly amitraz, ivermectins and pyrethroids, ticks have become increasingly resistant to these pesticides. Nicholas Jonsson of the Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine at the University of Glasgow, UK and colleagues from the University of Queensland, Australia, have now discovered how ticks develop resistance to one of the main pesticides. The scientists have identified the genetic basis for at least one form of resistance to amitraz which will allow a genetic test for resistance to be developed. This research paves the way for a new genetic test for resistance that will help farmers make management decisions for the control of ticks. This will also enable empirical studies on field and laboratory populations of ticks to test the effectiveness of resistance management strategies.<br>

Looking away from the traditional, linear research-for-development impact pathway, the proposed integrated systems approach involves working with rural people to establish what impacts are needed, then defines what outcomes will deliver these impacts, then identifies what outputs (if adopted) will produce the desired outcomes, and finally determines what research will lead to these outputs, thus following the impact pathway backwards. This article presents a range of empirical examples of its application in dryland contexts.<br>

The reports is following up on the recommendations of the 2009 FAO/WHO expert meeting and reviews national and international activities on the risk analysis of nanomaterials in the food and agriculture sectors that have been carried out since this meeting. One conclusion is that several data gaps with respect to interaction between nanomaterials and food matrices, behaviours of nanomaterials in human body, methods to determine such interactions and behaviours, and the relevance of such data for risk assessment continue to exist. International collaboration and information exchange between scientists from academia, industry and authorities to address such gaps is therefore needed.<br>

                    Call for Proposals: CTA Top 20 Innovations for Smallholder farmers
                  </h3>
                  <p style="margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; font-size:14px;">
                    Deadline: 15 February 2014<br>
                    <br>
                    CTA is calling for proposals on innovations in use or have potential in smallholder agricultural production systems in ACP countries and which if known and widely promoted can benefit other farming communities. From among the applicants, an international jury, comprising a multi-disciplinary team of experts drawn from agricultural research, academia, extension and farmers&rsquo; organizations will select a shortlist (40-50) which will then be voted on by farmers. The final top 20 will be selected by an international panel of experts. Successful applicants (CTA top 20) will be given a grant of 5,000 Euros to elaborate their &lsquo;innovation&rsquo; as a guidebook (for which they will receive support from the jury members); and invited to a cross-learning workshop where they will also work with an editor and an artist to finalize the guidebook which explains the innovation and the design of a brochure and a poster which can be disseminated to the public at large (for use, inter alia, by extension agents).<br>
